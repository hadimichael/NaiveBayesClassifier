  "article": "The South Sydney Rabbitohs (often shortened to Souths ) is a professional Australian rugby league team based in Redfern , a suburb of south-central Sydney, New South Wales .  They participate in the National Rugby League (NRL) premiership and are one of nine existing teams from the state capital. They are current NRL champions. , The club was formed in 1908 as one of the founding members of the New South Wales Rugby Football League , making them one of Australia's oldest rugby league teams. They are one of only two foundation clubs still present in the NRL, the other being the Sydney Roosters .  The South Sydney District Rugby League Football Club is currently a subsidiary company 75% owned by Blackcourt League Investments which is, in turn, 50% owned by the actor Russell Crowe and 50% owned by James Packer 's Consolidated Press Holdings; the other 25% is owned by the financial Members of the club.  , The Rabbitohs' traditional heartland covers the once typically working-class suburbs of inner-south and south-eastern Sydney. The club is based in Redfern, where the club's administration and training facilities are located, however they have long held a wide supporter base spread all over New South Wales. The team's home ground is currently Stadium Australia in Sydney Olympic Park . In the New South Wales Rugby League (1908–1994), Australian Rugby League (1995–1997), and National Rugby League (1998-1999, 2002–present) competitions South Sydney are the most successful professional team in the history of Australian rugby league in terms of total championships won, having claimed 21 first grade premierships. , , , The South Sydney District Rugby League Football Club was formed at a meeting on 17 January 1908 at Redfern Town Hall  when administrator J J Giltinan , cricketer Victor Trumper and politician Henry Clement Hoyle came together in front of a large crowd of supporters.  The club played in the first round of the newly formed New South Wales Rugby League , defeating North Sydney 11–7 at Birchgrove Oval on 20 April 1908 .   The team went on to win the inaugural premiership then successfully defended their title in the 1909 season , winning the Grand Final by default.  During these early years Arthur Hennessy was considered the \"founding father\" of the South Sydney rugby league club. A hooker and prop forward, Hennessy was Souths' first captain and coach. He was also New South Wales' first captain and Australia's first test captain in 1908. S. G. \"George\" Ball became Club Secretary in 1911 after Arthur Hennessy stood down from the position, and he remained in that capacity for over fifty years, only retiring a few years before his death in 1969. , After further premiership success in 1914 and 1918 , South Sydney won seven of the eight premierships from 1925 – 1932 , only missing out in 1930 . The 1925 side went through the season undefeated  and is only one of six Australian premiership sides in history to have achieved this feat. Such was Souths dominance in the early years of the rugby league competition that the Rabbitohs were labelled \"The Pride of the League\".   , South Sydney struggled through most of the 1940s, only making the semifinals on two occasions (1944 and 1949). South Sydney's longest losing streak of 22 games was during the period 1945–1947. In the 1945 season they only managed to win one game while in 1946 they were unable to win a single game. , In the 1950s South Sydney again had great success, winning five of the six premierships from 1950 – 1955 , and losing the 1952 Grand Final against Western Suburbs in controversial circumstances. The 1951 side's point scoring feat in their 42–14 victory over Manly-Warringah  remains the highest score by a team in a Grand Final and \"the miracle of '55 \"   involved South Sydney winning 11 straight sudden death matches to win the premiership. Players that were involved in these years included Denis Donoghue , Jack Rayner , Les \"Chicka\" Cowie , Johnny Graves , Ian Moir , Greg Hawick , Ernie Hammerton , Bernie Purcell and Clive Churchill . Churchill, nicknamed \"the Little Master\" for his brilliant attacking fullback play, is universally regarded as one of the greatest ever Australian rugby league players. , In the late 1950s Souths began a poor run of form failing to make the finals from 1958 – 1964 . However in 1965 a talented young side made the Grand Final against St. George who were aiming to secure their 10th straight premiership. The young Rabbitohs weren't overawed by the Dragons formidable experience and in front of a record crowd of 78,056  at the Sydney Cricket Ground , they went down narrowly 12–8.  The nucleus of this side went on to feature in Australian representative teams for the next six years and ensured another golden period for South Sydney making five successive grand finals from 1967 – 1971 , winning four. Bob McCarthy , John O'Neill , Eric Simms , Ron Coote , Mike Cleary and John Sattler from 1965 were later joined by Elwyn Walters , Ray Branighan , Paul Sait , Gary Stevens and coach Clive Churchill to form a fearsome combination before internal strife and poaching by other clubs from 1972 onwards unravelled the star studded pack.  From this period comes part of South's and Australian Rugby League folklore when in the 1970 premiership decider against Manly, captain John Sattler inspired the side to victory playing out 70 minutes of the match with his jaw broken  in three places after being king hit by Manly prop John Bucknall.   , Financial problems started to hit Souths in the early 1970s, forcing some players to go to other clubs. The licensed Leagues Club, traditionally such an important revenue provider to all first grade league sides, was closed in 1973 but a \"Save Our Souths\" campaign ensured the club survived. \"Super Coach\" Jack Gibson 's  arrival turned the club's form, winning the pre-season competition in 1978 .  The club captured victories in the mid-week Tooth Cup competition in 1981  and in the pre-season \"Sevens\" competition in 1988 .  The Rabbitohs were able to make the finals on five occasions in the 1980s, including a dominant season to finish as minor premiers in 1989 .  The 1989 season proved to be the club's most successful in years, but also marked the last time the club was able to reach the finals until 2007. The following season the Rabbitohs finished as wooden spooners . , The club stayed afloat in the 1990s despite major financial problems. Souths' only success came in 1994 when they won the pre-season competition, defeating the Brisbane Broncos 27–26 in the final.  The Super League War and the eventual formation of the National Rugby League affected the club greatly when it was determined in 1998 that the newly formed competition would be contracted to 14 teams for the 2000 season . Following a series of mergers by other teams,  South Sydney failed to meet the National Rugby League's selection criteria to compete in the competition and were subsequently excluded from the premiership at the end of the 1999 season . , In 2000 and 2001, South Sydney fought their way back into the competition following a string of high-profile legal battles  against the National Rugby League and News Limited.  A number of well attended public rallies took place during this time, as supporters from many different clubs got behind South Sydney's case. Upon appeal to the Federal Court in 2001,  South Sydney won readmission into the premiership for the 2002 season .  , After being readmitted, the Rabbitohs were initially unsuccessful in the premiership, finishing amongst the bottom three teams for five seasons straight including three wooden spoons . However, following the club's takeover by actor Russell Crowe and businessman Peter Holmes à Court in 2006,  the club has had great success in securing a number of major national and international player signings such as the four Burgess Brothers and Greg Inglis. The club was also successful in recruiting several key managerial positions including Jason Taylor as head coach in 2007 and more recently Michael Maguire in 2012. , South Sydney was a party to one of the sponsorship deals promoted by the fraudulent company Firepower International .  , South Sydney won their first three games of the 2007 season (marking their best start to a season since 1972 ) and being competitive in every game. On the back of one of the best defences in the competition, the Rabbitohs finished strongly making the semi-finals for the first time since 1989. They finished the season in 7th position, going down to Manly in the playoffs. , On 26 January 2008, the Rabbitohs lost 24–26 to the Leeds Rhinos in front of 12,000 fans at the University of North Florida in Jacksonville, Florida , the first time first-grade professional rugby league teams from Australia and England have played each other in the United States. , May 2008 saw the sudden resignation of the then current Executive chairman and CEO, Peter Holmes à Court . He had been appointed to the role of CEO at the start of 2008.   Reports suggested that Holmes à Court had been forced to stand down after his relationship with Russell Crowe had deteriorated beyond repair.      , The South Sydney Rabbitohs celebrated their centenary year during the 2008 National Rugby League season . That year they were named the National Trust 's inaugural 'Community Icon', in recognition of the club's significant longstanding contribution to sport and sporting culture at both state and national levels.  In April 2012 the South Sydney Rabbitohs became the second club to record 1000 wins in First Grade.  That same year the Rabbitohs finished third at the end of the regular season, qualifying for the finals for the first time since 2007 and just the second time since 1989.  , The South Sydney Rabbitohs finished third at the end of the regular season in 2014. They went on to win the Grand Final against the Canterbury Bulldogs 30-6 to claim their first premiership in 43 years, with Sam Burgess claiming the Clive Churchill Medal , South Sydney's first Clive Churchill Medallist in 43 years (taking into account the retrospective Clive Churchill medal awarded to Ron Coote in 1971). On Thursday 9 October 2014, the Rabbitohs were presented with the Keys to the City of Randwick by Mayor Ted Seng at a presentation ceremony at Souths Juniors in Kingsford and later the same day awarded the Keys to the City of Sydney by Lord Mayor Clover Moore at a reception at Sydney Town Hall. , On 23 October 2014, Holmes à Court sold his 50% share of Blackcourt League Investments, and consequently his 37.5% stake in South Sydney, to James Packer 's ScrumPac Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of Packer's Consolidated Press Holdings.  , The club mascot is the rabbitoh , a now-disused term that was commonly used in the early 20th century to describe hawkers who captured and skinned rabbits and then sold the meat at markets,  so named because they would shout \"rabbit-oh!\" around the markets to attract buyers. The club is also informally referred to as the Rabbits , Bunnies or Souths . , Exactly how South Sydney came to be known as the Rabbitohs is unknown. According to one version of events, dating from pre- schism days at the turn of the 20th century, some of the club's players earned some extra money on Saturday mornings as rabbit-oh men, staining their jerseys with rabbit blood in the process; when they played in those blood stained jumpers that afternoon, opponents from wealthier rugby clubs did not always appreciate the aroma and would mockingly repeat the \"Rabbitoh!\" cry.  Another version was that the term was a disparaging reference by opposing teams to South's home ground being plagued with \"rabbit 'oles\"; in those early days Redfern Oval was then known as Nathan's Cow Paddock.  A third version claims the Rabbitoh name was adopted from that of the touring Australian rugby union teams of the early 1900s who were nicknamed \"Rabbits\" prior to discarding the name in 1908 in favour of the moniker \"Wallabies\".  , The \"Rabbitoh\" emblem, a running white rabbit, first appeared on the team's jersey in 1959 . The Rabbitoh emblem has in various forms been carried as the club's crest on every player's jersey ever since. The original \"Rabbitoh\" emblem design that appeared on the team's jerseys throughout the 1960s and 1970s has now been incorporated on the current jersey. , The South Sydney Rabbitohs celebrated their centenary year during 2008. The club released a centenary emblem to commemorate the occasion. To also coincide with the centenary year, Souths opted to alter their logo by removing the red and green oval from their emblem for a solid white rabbit with the words South Sydney Rabbitohs set in uppercase type. , South Sydney has used cardinal red and myrtle green colours on its playing jerseys for the vast majority of the club's history. Prior to the establishment of the rugby league club in 1908, the South Sydney rugby union team originally wore a red and green hooped jersey. Some sources have suggested that this combination of colours was due to the local rugby union club being nicknamed the \"Redfern Waratahs\". The first British inhabitants had often called the waratah a \"red fern\" instead, hence giving the suburb its name, and ultimately the local rugby club its emblem. Red and green dominate the colours of the waratah and hence, possibly, the South Sydney Rugby League Football Club adopted these colours for their jerseys.  However, the suburb of Redfern was named in honour of Dr. William Redfern , one of the first doctors of the colony, who treated convicts and poor settlers as well as the wealthy. , The club's jersey has been a hooped-styled one comprising alternating red and green, and has been used for the vast majority of the club's history.  In 1945 and 1946 the club broke with this tradition and used a green design with a red \"V\" around the collar, before reverting to the original hoop style. From 1980 to 1984 the team played in a strip which saw the inclusion of white hoops within a predominately green design with a central red stripe and was affectionately known as the \"Minties\"  jersey (so-called due to its apparent similarity to the wrapper design of the popular sweet). With the introduction of \"away\" jerseys towards the end of the 20th century, the club initially introduced a predominantly white jersey for away matches which was changed to a predominantly black one for the 2006 season . , Before the start of the 2007 season , the club announced that the away jersey would be styled identically to the traditional home jersey, with the exception of sponsorship and the rabbit emblem, which has been styled similarly to the one that initially featured on jerseys in the 1960s.  For season 2009, the rabbit emblem is black for home matches whilst the emblem is the original white for away matches.  , The playing shorts worn were historically black, though in the late 1970s the club adopted green shorts with a red vertical stripe. This was then superseded by the white shorts of the \"Minties\" outfit. When the club subsequently reverted to their traditional playing strip, the decision was made to wear black shorts once more. In 2008 the Rabbitohs wore white shorts to match the white stripe running down the side of their jersey. , During the early years of the New South Wales Rugby League premiership , \"home games\" were not assigned very often. However, South Sydney played most of their games at the Royal Agricultural Society Ground (Sydney Showground) from 1908 until the club's departure in 1920. From 1911 onwards, the Sydney Sports Ground was also used interchangeably with the Agricultural Ground over a decade for hosting matches.  In 1947 the club played its final season at the Sports Ground, before relocating to Redfern Oval in 1948.  It was here that team played in the heart of the club's territory and played the vast majority of its allocated home matches. , In 1988, the club began to play in the Sydney Football Stadium ,  just built upon the former Sydney Sports Ground and Sydney Cricket Ground No. 2 Oval. The side continued to play here up until 2005, with the exception of 2000 and 2001 when South Sydney was absent from the premiership. During 2004–2005, when the Rabbitohs contract with Sydney Football Stadium was about to expire, new home grounds were investigated at Gosford, North Sydney Oval and Telstra Stadium (now ANZ Stadium). Eventually the decision was made to relocate to Telstra Stadium at Homebush. The move was not well received by some of the fans,   but provided more money for the club that was several million dollars in the red at the end of 2005.  , In 2006 the club relocated home games to ANZ Stadium in Sydney's west (known as Telstra Stadium until the conclusion of 2007). In February 2008, the Rabbitohs renewed their partnership with ANZ Stadium to play NRL home games and home finals at the venue for the next 10 years, commencing season 2008. The agreement runs until the end of 2017, superseding the inaugural three-year home ground arrangement at ANZ Stadium that started in 2006. During 2008 the City of Sydney Council  completed a $19.5 million upgrade and renovation of Redfern Oval. From season 2009, the upgraded Redfern Oval will provide the Rabbitohs with training facilities and a venue for hosting pre-season and exhibition matches.  , As well as their main home ground, South Sydney also play home games at Central Coast Stadium , Barlow Park in Cairns, the Sydney Cricket Ground , and at Perth Oval during the year. , The South Sydney Rabbitohs continue to have a large supporter base in their traditional areas of South-eastern Sydney , despite having moved from Redfern Oval two decades ago, whilst also enjoying wide support throughout other rugby league playing centres around the country.  The official South Sydney supporter group is known as \"The Burrow.\"  While their active supporter group is known as \"Gate38\" which is made up of young men who were involved in the \"scumgate\" scandal in 2013.  The Rabbitohs also have a large supporter base in Perth , where they rival the Fremantle Dockers in supporter size. , The Rabbitohs have the highest football club membership in the National Rugby League, with total membership exceeding 35,000 as of June 23, 2015. The total member number also includes more than 11,000 ticketed members to date, the highest of the Sydney-based NRL Clubs. It was announced during the 2010 Charity Shield game that both St George Illawarra and Souths had exceeded the 10,000 milestone, making the 2010 season the first time two Sydney clubs have entered the season with 10,000 ticketed members each. The club has members from every state in Australia and international members located in 22 countries. Football club membership had peaked at some 22,000 when the club was readmitted to the National Rugby League for season 2002 .  , \"Group 14\", a collection of the club's backers which comprise an influential collection of businessmen, politicians and media personalities, was formed before the Rabbitohs' exclusion from the NRL in 1999.  Members included Andrew Denton , Anthony Albanese , Deirdre Grusovin , Mike Whitney , Laurie Brereton , Mikey Robins , Ron Hoenig , Nick Greiner , Ray Martin and former NSW Premier Kristina Keneally .   They contributed to South Sydney's bid for reinstatement, following the club's exclusion from the competition at the end of the 1999 season. A sustained campaign of public support that year, unprecedented in Australian sporting history , saw 40,000 people  attended a rally in the Sydney CBD in support of South Sydney's cause.   In 2000 and 2001, public street marches took place in Sydney with in excess of 80,000 people rallying behind the Rabbitohs.  The club also has a number of high-profile supporters as well, many of whom were dominant figures in their battle to be readmitted into the premiership in 2000 and 2001.   In 2007 supporters set a new club record for attendance with an average home crowd figure of 15,702 being the highest ever since the introduction of the home and away system in 1974.  , Reggie the Rabbit is the Rabbitohs mascot. The rabbit took lifesize form in 1968 when celebrity fan Don Lane brought back a suit from the US in time for the 1968 grand final against Manly, won by the Bunnies 13–9. Perhaps the most notable of the early Reggies was the club's groundsman Reg Fridd. Standing just over four feet tall, the Rabbitohs lured the diminutive Kiwi from a touring production of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, the same troupe that had yielded the second Reggie, Roscoe Bova, tragically killed in a car accident in the early 70s. Most teams in the National Rugby League maintain mascots. But none do the sort of charity work as Reggie and none dare venture to opposition grounds as he does. Yet for the current Reggie, Charlie Gallico – a sub-five footer who runs a panelbeating shop on the side – it's all part of the job. For five years little Charlie has been quietly and anonymously volunteering his services to his club and community to maintain a sideline alter-ego as one of sport's most enduring symbols. During 2000 and 2001, when Souths was excluded from the NRL, Anth Courtney was Reggie Rabbit appearing at the second Town Hall rally and at games at Redfern Oval as well as being active in travelling extensively around the state to attend fundraisers as Reggie Rabbit.  , The Juniors aka Souths Juniors on Anzac Parade in Kingsford, New South Wales    , Juniors @ The Junction (Since 2009) – The result of a merger with South Sydney Junior Rugby League Club (Kingsford) and the struggling Maroubra Returned and Services League (RSL) Club . The club is on the site of the former Maroubra RSL club on Anzac Parade and Haig Street.  , Souths On Chalmers (Since 2008) – on Chalmers Street in Redfern, New South Wales   Was the resurrected entity acting as South Sydney Leagues Club in 1500m2 of floorspace inside the old SOUTH SYDNEY LEAGUES' CLUB LTD ACN 000 250 528 building at 265 Chalmers Street, Redfern. Souths Leagues Club was placed under voluntary administration in July 1996, by the Board of Directors led by former player, coach and SSDRLFC Chairman, George Piggins . , The Juniors on Hawkesbury (Since 2008) – in the Hawkesbury River  , Souths has a long history of producing talented Indigenous players, including stars such as Eric Simms , Eric Robinson , Kevin Longbottom and, more recently, Nathan Merritt , Alex Johnston , Dylan Walker & Kyle Turner .  Throughout its history the club has selected young Aboriginal players from both the South Sydney district and regional New South Wales. The link to the Aboriginal community of the district goes back to the formation of the Redfern All Blacks Football Club   in 1930.  Indigenous players in the 2014 Souths squad include Greg Inglis , Nathan Merritt , Alex Johnston , Dylan Walker , Kyle turner , Beau Champion & Chris Grevsmuhl , The Rabbitohs and their fans have built up rivalries with other clubs, particularly the Sydney Roosters (Eastern Suburbs), the only other remaining foundation club.  The Rabbitohs and the Roosters share inner-Sydney territory, resulting in a strong rivalry since 1908 when Souths beat Eastern Suburbs in the first grand final 14–12. Games between the neighbouring foundation clubs have since formed part of the oldest \" local derby \" in the competition.  The rivalry increased after 1950 due to conflict between junior territories and since the 1970s escalated once more as both clubs drew key players away from each other (Souths lost internationals Ron Coote , Elwyn Walters and Jim Morgan to the Roosters from their last era of premiership winning teams, whilst more recently Souths lured key forwards Bryan Fletcher , Peter Cusack and centre Shannon Hegarty away from the Roosters 2002 premiership winning side) & later Michael Crocker. In Round 1, 2010, the Rabbitohs and Roosters became the first clubs to play 200 matches against each other. The Roosters' 36–10 victory put the ledger at 105 games won by South Sydney, 90 by the Roosters (Eastern Suburbs) and 5 drawn.  To celebrate their rivalry, the Rabbitohs and Roosters contest The Ron Coote Cup annually.  , Other long-time traditional rivals include the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles , who since 1970 purchased many of Souths' star players including John O'Neill, Ray Brannighan , Ian Roberts ,  and more recently Luke Burgess .  And Souths had rivalries with former clubs the St George Dragons (resulting in the annual Charity Shield match) and Balmain Tigers . The rivalry with Balmain began in 1909 when the Tigers failed to appear for the grand final and thereby forfeited to Souths.   In the 1969 NSWRFL season enmity was again fueled between the clubs with Balmain's controversial  victory against the Rabbitohs in the grand final that year.  The Rabbitohs still carry these traditional rivalries with newly formed joint-venture clubs St George Illawarra Dragons and Wests Tigers . , A book, The Book of Feuds , chronicling the rivalries of the Rabbitohs with their NRL competitors was written by Mark Courtney at the instigation of Russell Crowe. It has been used as a motivational tool before Souths matches and was later released on sale to the public.  , South Sydney are the most successful club in terms of honours and individual player achievements in the history of Australian rugby league. , The club achievements include: , The club's players have also achieved some notable individual game and point scoring milestones: , Head coach , Assistant coaches , , Jason Clark (City) , Notes: , In 2002 on the Rabbitohs readmission to the competition, The Magnificent XIII ,  a team consisting of great South Sydney players over the years was selected by a panel of rugby league journalists and former Souths players and coaches. The team consists of 17 players (four being reserves) and a coach representing the South Sydney Rabbitohs Football Club from 1908 through to 2002 . , The George Piggins Medal is the award given to the Rabbitohs player determined to have been the \" Best and Fairest \" throughout an NRL season. The inaugural winner of the award in 2003 was Bryan Fletcher . In 2013, John Sutton & Greg Inglis became the first joint winners of the award.  , The George Piggins Medal is the award given to the Rabbitohs player determined to have been the \" Best and Fairest \" throughout an NRL season.
