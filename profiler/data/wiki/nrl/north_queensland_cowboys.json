They compete in Australasia's elite rugby league competition, the National Rugby League (NRL) premiership.

They played in the breakaway Super League competition in 1997 before continuing to compete in the re-unified National Rugby League competition the following year. After running into financial trouble in 2001, the club was taken over by News Limited . , The Cowboys had to wait ten years to finish a season in the top half of the ladder, finishing in the top 8 for the first time the teams history in 2004. The following season they reached the grand final for the first time. In 2007, the team was sold by News Limited to the Cowboys League Club. , In 2011, they were the most watched NRL club on pay television, and their round four clash with the Parramatta Eels was the fourth most watched sports event in Fox Sport's history.  , In 2014, the Cowboys won the inaugural NRL Auckland Nines tournament, the club's first ever trophy. , , , With the success of the Broncos in 1988, speculation intensified as to if the NSWRL would admit a new team based in North Queensland.

One of the major difficulties that faced the club in their early years was attracting followers from the more established Queensland-based Winfield Cup side, the Brisbane Broncos .

The Cowboys began their first season in this competition strongly, and after six rounds they were in equal first place.

Although they finished in their highest position to date, coach Hurst was also sacked at early in the 2003 season, and replaced by Graham Murray .
