  "article": "The St. Louis Cardinals are a professional baseball team based in St. Louis , Missouri , that competes in the National League (NL) of Major League Baseball (MLB). The new Busch Stadium has been their home stadium since 2006. With origins as one of the early professional baseball clubs in St. Louis, entrepreneur Chris von der Ahe purchased a barnstorming club in 1881 then known as the Brown Stockings and established them as charter members of the American Association (AA) the following season. Upon the discontinuation of the AA, St. Louis joined the NL in 1892; at that time, they were called the Browns and the Perfectos before they were officially renamed as the Cardinals in 1900. , One of the most successful franchises in baseball history, the Cardinals have won 11 World Series championships (second only to the New York Yankees ' 27), 19 National League pennants , and 12 division titles. While still in the AA, St. Louis won four league championships, qualifying them to play in a forerunner of the World Series. They tied in 1885 and won outright in 1886  (both times against the predecessor of the Chicago Cubs ) in a storied rivalry that continues on today. , Cardinals achievements that have impacted MLB and sports in general include Branch Rickey 's pioneering of the farm system , Rogers Hornsby 's two batting Triple Crowns , Dizzy Dean 's 30- win season in 1934 , Stan Musial 's 17 MLB and 29 NL records, Bob Gibson 's 1.12 earned run average (ERA) in 1968 , Whitey Herzog 's Whiteyball , Mark McGwire breaking the single-season home run record in 1998 , and the 2011 championship team's unprecedented comebacks.  The Cardinals have won 105 or more games in four different seasons and won 100 or more a total of eight times. Cardinals players have won 20 league MVPs , four batting Triple Crowns, and three Cy Young Awards . Baseball Hall of Fame inductees include Lou Brock , Dean, Gibson, Herzog, Hornsby, Joe Medwick , Musial, Rickey, Red Schoendienst , Ozzie Smith , and Bruce Sutter . , In 2014, Forbes valued the Cardinals at $820 million, making them the 8th-most valuable franchise in MLB; their revenue the previous year was $283 million and operating income of $65.2 million was the highest in MLB. Since their purchase in 1995, owner William DeWitt, Jr. 's investment group has seen enormous growth from the $147 million purchase price. John Mozeliak is the general manager and Mike Matheny is the manager .  Renowned for strong support from fans—despite being in one of the sport's mid-level markets, the Cardinals routinely see attendances among the league's highest, and are consistently among the Top 3 in MLB in local television ratings.   , Professional baseball began in St. Louis with the inception of the Brown Stockings in the National Association (NA) in 1875 . The NA folded following that season, and the next season , St. Louis joined the National League as a charter member, finishing in third place at 45-19. George Bradley hurled the first no-hitter in Major League history . The NL expelled St. Louis from the league after 1877 due to a game-fixing scandal and the team went bankrupt.  Without a league, they continued play as a semi-professional barnstorming team through 1881. , The magnitudes of the reorganizations following the 1877 and 1881 seasons are such that the 1875-1877 and 1878-1881 Brown Stockings teams are not generally considered to share continuity as a franchise with the current St. Louis Cardinals;   , For the 1882 season , Chris von der Ahe purchased the team, reorganized it, and made it a founding member of the American Association (AA), a league to rival the NL.  1882 is generally considered to be the first year existence of the St. Louis Cardinals.    [ c ] , The next season , St. Louis shortened their name to the Browns . Soon thereafter they became the dominant team in the AA, as manager Charlie Comiskey guided St. Louis to four pennants in a row from 1885 to 1888 .   Pitcher and outfielder Bob Caruthers led the league in ERA (2.07) and wins (40) in 1885 and finished in the top six in both in each of the following two seasons. He also led the AA in OBP (.448) and OPS (.974) in 1886 and finished fourth in batting average in 1886 (.334) and fifth in 1887 (.357).  Outfielder Tip O'Neill won the first batting triple crown in franchise history in 1887 and the only one in AA history.    By winning the pennant, the Browns played the NL pennant winner in a predecessor of the World Series . The Browns twice met the Chicago White Stockings - the Chicago Cubs prototype - tying one in a heated dispute and winning the other , thus spurring the vigorous St. Louis-Chicago rivalry that ensues to this day.  During the franchise's ten seasons in the AA, they compiled an all-time league-high of 780 wins and .639 winning percentage. They lost just 432 contests while tying 21 others.  , The AA went bankrupt after the 1891 season and the Browns transferred to the National League. This time, the club entered an era of stark futility. Between 1892 and 1919 , St. Louis managed just five winning seasons, finished in last or next-to-last place sixteen times, and ended four seasons with 100 losses or more. The nadir was the 1897 season : a 29–102 record for a franchise-worst .221 winning percentage.  St. Louis' 84-67 finish as the Perfectos would be the team's best finish between the AA era and Sam Breadon 's purchase of the team.  As the \"Perfectos\", the team wore their jersey with a cardinal red trim and sock striping.  Later that season, St. Louis Republic sportswriter Willie McHale included an account in a column of a female fan he heard remarking about the uniforms, \"What a lovely shade of cardinal.\" Fans liked the moniker \"Cardinals\" and, the next year, popularity for the nickname induced an official change to Cardinals .  , In 1902 , an American League team moved from Milwaukee into St. Louis, renamed themselves the St. Louis Browns and built a new park on the site of the Cardinals' old stadium , striking a rivalry that lasted five decades.  Breadon bought a minority interest in the Cardinals in 1917 and in 1919 Browns manager Branch Rickey joined the Cardinals.   The Cardinals' first twenty-eight seasons in the NL were a complete reversal of their stay in the AA – with a .406 winning percentage, they compiled 1,632 wins, 2,425 losses and 74 ties.  , St. Louis baseball commenced a renaissance : since 1926 the Cardinals have won eleven World Series and nineteen NL pennants.  Breadon spurred this revival when bought out the majority stake in 1920 and appointed Rickey as business manager, who expanded scouting, player development, and pioneered the minor league farm system , filling the role of today's general manager .  With Rogers Hornsby at second base, he claimed Triple Crowns in 1922 and 1925 , and the Cardinals won the 1926 World Series , their first.   St. Louis then won the league in 1928 , 1930 , and 1931 and the 1931 World Series .  , The Gashouse Gang edition claimed the 1934 World Series  and the Cardinals amassed new thresholds of popularity far outside St. Louis via radio .  Dizzy Dean led the Gang, winning the 1934 MVP , and leading the NL multiple times in wins , strikeouts , innings , complete games and shutouts .  Johnny Mize and Joe Medwick emerged as two power threats, with Medwick claiming the last Triple Crown for a Cardinal in 1937 .      , In the 1940s, a golden era emerged as Rickey's farm system became laden with such talent as Marty Marion ,  Enos Slaughter ,  Mort Cooper ,  Walker Cooper ,  Stan Musial ,  Max Lanier ,  Whitey Kurowski ,  Red Schoendienst  and Johnny Beazley .  It was one of the most successful decades in franchise history with 960 wins 580 losses for a winning percentage higher than any other Major League team at .623.  With Billy Southworth managing, they won the World Series in 1942 and 1944 (in the only all-St. Louis series against the Browns ), and won 105 or more games each in 1942 , 1943 , and 1944 .  Southworth's managerial winning percentage (.642) is St. Louis' highest since the franchise joined the National League.   Musial was considered the most consistent hitter of his era and most accomplished in team history, winning three MVPs and seven batting titles .   St. Louis then won the 1946 World Series on Slaughter's Mad Dash in Game 7.  Breadon was forced to sell the team in 1947 but won six World Series and nine NL pennants as Cardinals owner.  They remained competitive, finishing .500 or better in thirteen of the next seventeen seasons, but fell short of winning the league or World Series until 1964 .  , In 1953 the Anheuser-Busch brewery bought the Cardinals and August \"Gussie\" Busch became team president,  spurring the Browns' departure in 1953 to Baltimore to become the Orioles , and making the Cardinals the only major league club in town.  More success followed in the 1960s, starting with what is considered one of the most lopsided trades in Major League history, as St. Louis received outfielder Lou Brock from the Cubs for pitcher Ernie Broglio .  MVP third baseman Ken Boyer and pitcher Bob Gibson led the club to a World Series win the same year  and Curt Flood , Bill White , Curt Simmons , and Steve Carlton also made key contributions in this decade.     In 1967 , new arrival Orlando Cepeda won the MVP, helping to propel St. Louis to the World Series .   The Cardinals won the league the following year behind their Major League-leading 2.49 staff ERA  in what was an all-round record-breaking season of pitching dominance . Posting a modern-day record low ERA of 1.12 and striking out a one-game World Series -record of 17,  Gibson won both the MVP and Cy Young awards that year.  , In the 1970s, catcher/third baseman Joe Torre and first baseman Keith Hernández each won MVPs, but the team's best finishes were second place and 90 wins .    The team found their way back to the World Series the next decade, starting with manager Whitey Herzog and his Whiteyball style of play and another trade that altered course of the franchise: in 1982 , shortstop Garry Templeton was shipped to the Padres for fellow shortstop Ozzie Smith .   Widely regarded as one of the best defensive players in history, Smith ranks first all-time among shortstops in Gold Glove Awards (13), All-Star games (15), assists (8,375), and double plays (1,590).   St. Louis took the Suds Series from the Milwaukee Brewers that fall.   The Cardinals again won the league in 1985 and 1987 .  In the 1985 Series , they faced-off with cross-state rivals Kansas City Royals for the first time in a non-exhibition game.  , After Gussie Busch died in 1989 ,  the brewery took control  and hired Joe Torre to manage late in 1990 ,  then sold the team to an investment group led by William DeWitt, Jr. in 1996 .  Tony La Russa replaced Torre in the spring of 1996.  In 1998, Mark McGwire teamed with the Cubs' Sammy Sosa for a barrage of home runs in their pursuit of the single-season home run record .  From 2000 to 2013 , the Cardinals reestablished their way to the top with ten playoff appearances, four NL pennants , two World Series titles and 1,274 regular season wins against 993 losses for a .560 winning percentage, leading the National League and second in MLB only to the New York Yankees .  With the addition of Jim Edmonds , Albert Pujols , and Scott Rolen , the Cardinals featured three prominent sluggers and defenders nicknamed \"MV3;\"  Pujols won three MVPs and hit .328 with 445 home runs in his Cardinals career.  In 2004 , playoff stalwart Chris Carpenter 's 3.09 ERA and 15 wins  helped power the team to a major-league best 105 wins and take the NL pennant .  In 2006 , beset with injuries and inconsistency,  they won the World Series , beating Detroit in five games to set an all-time record-low of 83 wins for a World Series winner.    , In 2009 , the Cardinals reached 10,000 wins, dating to when they first played in the American Association (AA). [ d ]   St. Louis returned to the playoffs in 2011 , first surmounting the largest games-won deficit after 130 games (at 10.5) to upstage the Atlanta Braves on the final day for the wild card playoff berth.  In Game 3 of the World Series , Pujols became just third player to hit three home runs in a World Series game.  In Game 6, third baseman David Freese and outfielder Lance Berkman each tied the score on the Cardinals' final strike – the first such occurrence in any game in MLB history – and St. Louis defeated the Texas Rangers later that game with a walk-off home run from Freese.  After winning that Series, La Russa retired and became the only manager to do so after winning a title. He also finished with the most wins for managers in franchise history with 1,408.   , La Russa's successor, Mike Matheny , helped extend St. Louis' playoff run as he became the first manager in the division play era to guide the Cardinals to the NLCS and playoffs in his first two seasons.  In 2014 , the Cardinals extended their NLCS streak to 4, with their 3-1 series victory over the Dodgers , in the NLDS . Ten days after being eliminated from the postseason by the San Francisco Giants, rookie outfielder Oscar Taveras was killed in a car accident while traveling to his hometown Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic .  On November 17, they acquired Atlanta Braves right-fielder Jason Heyward (who had just come off a Gold Glove -winning season) to replace Taveras.  On June 16, 2015, the FBI and the Justice Department started an investigation on the Cardinals for possibly hacking the Houston Astros . It is unknown if this hack was done by a group of executives, or everyone in the Cardinals front office.  , The Cardinals play their home games at Busch Stadium (also referred to as New Busch Stadium or Busch III ) in downtown St. Louis , straddling Seventh and Clark near the intersection of I nterstates 64 and 70 .  The stadium opened for the 2006 season at a cost of $411 million and holds a normal capacity of 46,861.   The Cardinals finished their inaugural season in the new Busch Stadium by winning the 2006 World Series , the first team since the 1923 New York Yankees to do so.  This open-air stadium emulates the HOK Sport -designed \" retro-style \" baseball-only parks built since the 1990s.  The open panoramic perspective over the outfield wall offers a remarkable view of St. Louis' downtown skyline featuring the distinctive Gateway Arch .  A replica of Eads Bridge spans the entrance to the park on the third base side, while the statue of Stan Musial arises in front of that entrance.  Other statues at the corner of Eighth and Clark include Hall of Famers Rogers Hornsby , Ozzie Smith , George Sisler , Cool Papa Bell , Bob Gibson , Jack Buck and others.  , Due to increased demand, Game 7 of the 2011 World Series accommodated a baseball record of 47,399 by increasing the number of standing room only tickets. The attendance record for any sporting event is 48,263, in a 2013 Association Football (soccer) friendly match between Chelsea F.C. and Manchester City F.C. , made possible by on field seating.  The largest attendance (53,000) of any event at Busch belongs to U2 during a concert from their 360° Tour in 2011.  , Ballpark Village , a mixed-use development located across Clark Street from Busch Stadium, is targeted to enhance the ballpark goers' experience. Phase 1 of the development, completed for the start of the 2014 season, includes entertainment venues, restaurants , and retail. Anchored by Cardinals Nation (which includes the Cardinals Hall of Fame , a two-story Cardinals-themed restaurant and all-inclusive rooftop seating for 300+ fans featuring spectacular views of the field across the street), a 20,000 sq ft Budweiser Brew House, FOX Sports Midwest Live! and PBR , the $100 million phase 1 development of Ballpark Village promises to be a vibrant gathering space throughout the year, not just during the baseball season.  , Busch Stadium is the Cardinals' fourth home ballpark and the third of that name. The Cardinals' original home ballpark was Sportsman's Park from 1882–1892 when they played in the American Association and were known as the Browns. In 1893 , the Browns moved to a new ballpark five blocks northwest of Sportsman's Park which would serve as their home from 1893-1920. The new park was originally called New Sportsman's Park but became more commonly referred to as Robison Field .  Midway through the 1920 season the Cardinals abandoned Robison Field and returned to the original Sportsman's Park and became tenants of their American League rivals, the St. Louis Browns . In 1953, the Anheuser-Busch Brewery purchased the Cardinals and the new owner subsequently also purchased Sportsman's Park from the Browns and renamed it Busch Stadium, later becoming Busch I. The Browns then left St. Louis for Baltimore after the season. The Cardinals built Busch Memorial Stadium , or Busch II, in downtown St. Louis, opened it during the 1966 season and played there until 2005.  It was built as the multi-purpose home of both the baseball Cardinals and the St. Louis football Cardinals, now the Arizona Cardinals . The current Busch Stadium was constructed adjacent to, and partly atop, the site of Busch Memorial Stadium. , The Cardinals home field in spring training is Roger Dean Stadium in Jupiter, Florida . They share the complex, which opened in 1998, with the Miami Marlins . Before moving to Jupiter, the Cardinals hosted spring training at Al Lang Field in St. Petersburg, Florida from 1937–1997. , The Cardinals have exceeded the attendance total of three million every season since 2004. , The Cardinals have had few logos throughout their history, although those logos have evolved over time. The first logo associated with the Cardinals was an interlocking \"SL\" that appeared on the team's caps and or sleeves as early as 1900. Those early uniforms usually featured the name \"St. Louis\" on white home and gray road uniforms which both had cardinal red accents. In 1920, the \"SL\" largely disappeared from the team's uniforms, and for the next 20 years the team wore caps that were white with red striping and a red bill. , In 1922, the Cardinals wore uniforms for the first time that featured the two familiar cardinal birds perched on a baseball bat over the name \"Cardinals\" with the letter \"C\" of the word hooked over the bat. The concept of the birds originated after general manager Branch Rickey noticed a colorful cardboard arrangement featuring cardinal birds on a table in a Presbyterian church in Ferguson, Missouri , at which he was speaking. The arrangement's production was by a woman named Allie May Schmidt. Schmidt's father, a graphic designer , helped Ricky make the logo a familiar staple on Cardinals uniforms.  Colloquially referred to as the \"birds on the bat,\" it initially appeared with the birds perched on a black bat and \"Cardinals\" in printed letters. An alternate version of this logo with \"St. Louis\" replacing \"Cardinals\" appeared in 1930 and was the primary logo in 1931 and 1932 before \"Cardinals\" returned. In 1940, the now-familiar \" StL \" logo was introduced on the team's caps. The interlocking \" StL \" has undergone several slight modifications over the years but has appeared on the team's caps every year since. The first appearance of the \"STL\" in 1940 coincided with the introduction of navy blue as a uniform color. From 1940 until 1955, the team wore navy blue caps with red bills and a red interlocking \" StL \" while the jerseys featured both cardinal red and navy blue accents. In 1951, the \"birds on the bat\" logo was changed to feature a yellow baseball bat.  , In 1956, the Cardinals changed their caps to solid blue with a red \" StL ,\" removing the red bill. Also, for that season only, the Cardinals wore a script \"Cardinals\" wordmark on their uniforms excluding the \"birds on the bat.\" An updated version of the \"birds on the bat\" logo returned in 1957 with the word \"Cardinals\" written in cursive beneath the bat. In 1962, the Cardinals became the first National League team to display players' names on the back of their jerseys. In 1964, while retaining their blue caps for road games, the Cardinals changed their home caps to all red with a white interlocking \" StL \". The next year, they changed their road caps to red as well. In 1967, the birds on the bat emblem on the jersey was again tweaked, making the birds more realistic and changing the position of their tails relative to the bat and this version remained on all Cardinals game jerseys through 1997. , In 1971, following the trend in baseball at the time, the Cardinals replaced the traditional flannel front-button shirts and pants with belts with new pullover knit jerseys and elastic waist pants. Another trend in baseball led the Cardinals to change their road uniforms from gray to light blue from 1976–1984. In 1992, the Cardinals returned to wearing traditional button-down shirts and pants with belts. That same year they also began wearing an all-navy cap with a red \" StL \" on the road only while wearing the same red and white cap at home games. In 1998, the \"birds on the bat\" was updated for the first time in 30 years with more detailed birds and bolder letters. That year, St. Louis introduced a cap featuring a single cardinal bird perched on a bat worn only on Sunday home games. The new birds on the bat design was modified again the next year, with yellow beaks and white eyes replacing the red beaks and yellow eyes of the 1998 version. Uniform numbers also returned to the front of the jerseys in 1999 after a two-year absence.  , On November 16, 2012, the Cardinals unveiled a new alternate uniform to be worn at home games on Saturdays beginning with the 2013 season. [ dated info ] The modified jersey, cream-colored with red trim on the sleeves and down the front, was the first since 1932 in which \"St. Louis\" will be used instead of \"Cardinals\" and retained the \"birds on the bat.\"  2013 also saw the team adopt their red caps as their main uniform for both home and away games; the navy cap was retained as an alternate, used mainly against other red-capped teams. Over the years, the Cardinals have released various marketing logos depicting anthropomorphized cardinals in a pitching stance, swinging a baseball bat, or wearing a baseball cap that never became part of the game uniform.  , The team mascot is an anthropomorphic cardinal wearing the team's uniform named Fredbird . He is assisted by Team Fredbird , a group of eleven women who entertain fans from the field and on top of the dugouts. , While unofficial, the Rally Squirrel became an unexpected phenomenon during the 2011 postseason. Making its \"debut\" in Game 3 of the NLDS on Oct 4, a squirrel ran across home plate in the middle of a pitch from Roy Oswalt of the Phillies to the Cardinals' Skip Schumaker . The Cardinals would win Game 4 and subsequently Game 5 (Oct. 7) in Philadelphia to advance to the NLCS, symbolizing the squirrel's \"role\" in the victory. The squirrel was popularized as \"Buschie the Rally Squirrel\"  As a tribute to the popularity of the squirrel, a small depiction of the Rally Squirrel is also included on the official World Series rings the team received. It shows up under the \"STL\" logo on the side of the ring. , Fredbird sparked controversy in May 2015, when he was asked by a fan for a photograph and handed him a sign that said \"Police Lives Matter\". The team later claimed that Fredbird should not be involved in any political activity or social commentary. , The Cardinals–Cubs rivalry refers to games between the Cardinals and the Chicago Cubs . The rivalry is also known as the Downstate Illinois rivalry or the I-55 Series (in earlier years as the Route 66 Series ) as both cities are located along Interstate 55 (which itself succeeded the famous U.S. Route 66 ). The Cubs lead the series 1,104–1,065 through June 14, 2013,  while the Cardinals lead in National League pennants with 19 against the Cubs' 16. The Cubs have won 10 of those pennants in Major League Baseball's Modern Era (1901–present), while all 19 of the Cardinals' pennants have been won since 1901. The Cardinals also have an edge when it comes to World Series successes, having won 11 championships to the Cubs' two. The Cardinals also have an advantage over their Chicago rivals in the regular season standings since the Cubs last participated in a World Series (1945): in the 66 seasons from 1946 through 2013, the Cardinals have finished ahead of the Cubs 51 times. In that same span, the Cardinals have had 47 seasons in which their winning percentage was over .500, while the Cubs have finished over that mark 19 times (they finished at an even .500 twice). Games featuring the Cardinals and Cubs see numerous visiting fans in either Busch Stadium in St. Louis or Wrigley Field in Chicago.  When the National League split into two and then three divisions, the Cardinals and Cubs remained together. This has added excitement to several pennant races over the years. , Although both teams play in the state of Missouri , they did not play each other for the first time until the 1985 World Series , which the Royals won in seven games, but which is perhaps best remembered for a controversial call from umpire Don Denkinger in Game 6. Due to their geographical proximity, the teams have faced each other every regular season in interleague play since it started in 1997. This is also referred to as the \"Show Me Series\" or the \"I-70 Series\" , as both cities are located in Missouri and are connected by Interstate 70 . The two teams are celebrating the 30th anniversary of their rivalry in 2015. , An investment group led by William DeWitt, Jr. owns the St. Louis Cardinals, having bought the team from Anheuser-Busch (AB) in 1996.  As with other periods of the Cardinals' transaction history, doubt loomed as to whether the purchaser would keep the team in St. Louis, due to the city's status as a \"small market,\" which appear to handicap a club's competitiveness. Such was the case when Sam Breadon put the Cardinals up for sale in 1947: then-NL President Ford Frick proposed moving the Cardinals to Chicago .  When AB placed the Cardinals for sale in 1995, they publicly expressed intention to find a buyer who would keep the club in St. Louis.  In March 1996, AB sold the team for $147 million to a partnership headed by Southwest Bank's Drew Baur , Hanser and DeWitt, Jr.  Civic Center Redevelopment, a subsidiary of AB, held the parking garages and adjacent property and also transferred them to the Baur ownership group.  Baur's group then sold the garages to another investment group, lowering the net franchise purchase price to about $100 million, about $10 million less than Financial World 's value of the team at the time $110 million.   , Current Cincinnati Reds owners Bob Castellini and brothers Thomas Williams and W. Joseph Williams Jr. each once owned a stake in the Cardinals dating back to the Baur-DeWitt group's purchase of the team. To allow their purchase of the Reds in 2005, the rest of the group bought out Castellini's and the Williams brothers' shares, totaling an estimated thirteen percent. At that time, the Forbes valued the Cardinals at about $370 million.  However, after reabsorbing that stake into the remainder of the group, they decided to make it available to new investors in 2010. Amid later allegations that the Cardinals owed the city profit shares, DeWitt revealed that their profitability had not reached the threshold to trigger that obligation.  , As of 2014, Forbes valued the Cardinals eighth among all MLB franchises. Their estimated value of $820 million was an increase of more than $100 million from the season before, when they ranked tenth. St. Louis' revenue in 2013 was $283 million. Their operating income of $65.2 million was the highest among all MLB franchises.   The year before, Forbes valued the Cardinals at $716.2 million and opined that they play \"in the best single-team baseball market in the country and are among the league's leaders in television ratings and attendance every season.\"  Concurrent with the growth of Major League Baseball , the Cardinals value has increased significantly since the Baur-DeWitt purchase. In 2000, the franchise was valued at $219 million,  a growth rate of 374% through 2014. The franchise's value grew 12.7% from 2013 to 2014. , Besides Ballpark Village, which has now finished its first phase, opening on March 27,   and considered a smashing success with the first phase of the project totaling 120,000 square feet (11,000 m 2 ).  the Cardinals own four of their Minor League Baseball affililiates: , Field managers with three or more years managing and the current manager are included here.  , Bullpen , Closer , Catchers , Infielders , Outfielders , , Pitchers , Catchers , Infielders , Outfielders , , Manager , Coaches , 60-day disabled list , , 25 active, 15 inactive , George Sisler *† , Charles Comiskey * , Roger Connor * , Pud Galvin * , In 2014, the Cardinals announced the reopening of the franchise Hall of Fame after six years on hiatus. A formal selection process will recognize former Cardinals as Cardinals Hall of Famers each year. In conjunction, the team released the names of 22 former players and personnel to be inducted for the inaugural class of 2014 .  , The Cardinals have retired twelve total jersey numbers––second in MLB only to the New York Yankees ' sixteen––in honoring fourteen total former players and club personnel on the left field wall at Busch Stadium .   A fifteenth, Jackie Robinson , is honored by all MLB teams.  It should be noted that, during the time Rogers Hornsby had played, the Cardinals did not have any numbers on their uniforms. This practice had begun with the Cleveland Indians in 1920. Thus, Hornsby had no number to retire. , Notes: , Capable of reaching 21 million listeners in nine states including Missouri , Illinois , Arkansas , Indiana , Iowa , Kentucky , Mississippi , Oklahoma , and Tennessee , the Cardinals radio network is the second-largest in MLB with 117 affiliate stations.  In St. Louis, CBS -owned KMOX (1120 AM) airs Cardinals games over radio and feeds the rest of the Cardinals network. Mike Shannon and John Rooney alternate as play-by-play announcers, with Chris Hrabe serving as pre-game and post-game host. KMOX's 50,000- watt clear-channel signal covers much of the continental United States at night. At one time, owing to the Cardinals' status as a \"regional\" franchise, the Cardinals radio network reached almost half of the country. , The 2011 season marked the Cardinals' return to KMOX following five seasons on KTRS (550 AM), a station which is 50 percent owned by the Cardinals. With a partnership spanning seven decades, and continuously since 1954, its conclusion realized after the 2005 season when CBS Radio and the Cardinals failed to reach terms on a new rights agreement. However, frustrated by the underpowered coverage of 5,000-watt KTRS, the Cardinals reached a new deal with KMOX in 2011. , Mike Shannon will announce 30 fewer games in 2013, compared to the 15 he took off in 2012, and in previous seasons. Most of the games will be road games and three-city trips. He has been announcing Cardinals' games starting in 1972, making 2013 his 41st year announcing. He turns 74 in July.
