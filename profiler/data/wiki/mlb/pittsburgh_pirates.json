  "article": "The Pittsburgh Pirates are a Major League Baseball (MLB) club based in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . They compete in the Central Division of the National League (NL), and play their home games at PNC Park , formerly at Forbes Field and Three Rivers Stadium (the latter's name is derived from the three rivers the Allegheny and the Monongahela, which join together to form the Ohio River .) Founded on October 15, 1881  as Allegheny, the franchise has won five World Series championships. The Pirates are also often referred to as the \"Bucs\" or the \"Buccos\" (derived from buccaneer , a synonym for pirate ). , The franchise joined the NL in its eighth season in 1887 and was competitive from its early years, winning three NL titles from 1901 to 1903, playing in the very first World Series in 1903 and winning their first World Series in 1909 behind Honus Wagner . The Pirates have had many ups and downs during their long history, most famously winning the 1960 World Series against the New York Yankees on a game-winning home run by Bill Mazeroski , the only time that Game 7 of the World Series has ever ended with a home run, still to this day. They also won the 1971 World Series with Roberto Clemente and the 1979 World Series under the slogan \" We Are Family \", led by \"Pops\" Willie Stargell . Overall the Pirates have won five World Series and lost four. , After a run of regular-season success in the early 1990s (winning three straight East Division titles), the Pirates struggled over the following 20 years, with 20 consecutive losing seasons—the longest such streak in North American professional sports history—before posting a winning record in 2013 of 94–68 to qualify for the NL Wild Card before advancing to the NL Division Series round where they lost in 5 games to the St. Louis Cardinals . , , , Professional baseball has been played in the Pittsburgh area since 1876. The teams of the era were \"independents\", barnstorming throughout the region and not affiliated with any organized league, though they did have salaries and were run as business organizations.  On October 15, 1881, the strongest team in the area joined the American Association as a founding member to begin play in 1882.  Their various home fields in the 19th century were in a then-separate city called Allegheny City , across the Allegheny River from Pittsburgh. The team was listed as \"Allegheny\" in the standings, and was sometimes called the \"Alleghenys\" ( not the \"Alleghenies\") in the same generic way that teams from Boston, New York, and Chicago were sometimes called the \"Bostons\", the \"New Yorks\", and the \"Chicagos\", in the sports writing style of that era. After five mediocre seasons in the A.A., Pittsburgh became the first A.A. team to switch to the older National League in 1887. At this time, the team renamed itself the Pittsburgh Alleghenys,  although Allegheny remained a separate city until it was annexed by Pittsburgh in 1907. At that time, owner-manager Horace Phillips sold the team to Dennis McKnight; Phillips stayed on as manager.  , Before the 1890 season, nearly all of the Alleghenys' best players bolted to the Players League 's Pittsburgh Burghers . The Players' League collapsed after the season, and the players were allowed to go back to their old clubs. However, the Alleghenys also scooped up highly regarded second baseman Lou Bierbauer , who had previously played with the AA's Philadelphia Athletics . Although the Athletics had failed to include Bierbauer on their reserve list, they loudly protested the Alleghenys' move. In an official complaint, an AA official claimed the Alleghenys' signing of Bierbauer was \"piratical\".  This incident (which is discussed at some length in The Beer and Whisky League , by David Nemec, 1994) quickly accelerated into a schism between the leagues that contributed to the demise of the A.A. Although the Alleghenys were never found guilty of wrongdoing, they made sport of being denounced for being \"piratical\" by renaming themselves \"the Pirates\" for the 1891 season.  The nickname was first acknowledged on the team's uniforms in 1912. Around the time the team adopted the Pirates nickname, the United States Board on Geographic Names forced the city of Pittsburgh to undergo a controversial name change by having them drop the \"h\" at the end of the name, making the team's official name the \"Pittsburg Pirates\" from the adoption of the Pirates nickname until Pittsburgh was able to get the \"h\" restored to its name in 1911. , The Pirates were a strong team in the early 1900s, winning National League pennants from 1901–1903 and taking their first World Series title in 1909 . They again won the NL in 1925 and 1927 and the World Series in 1925 . After a slow period, they returned to dominance and won the 1960 World Series , 1971 World Series and 1979 World Series . They won Eastern Division titles from 1990–1992 but did not return to the post-season after that until 2013. , On Opening Day 2015 the Pirates' loss to the Cincinnati Reds represented its 10,000 franchise loss and making it the fourth MLB team to achieve this distinction, after the Philadelphia Phillies , the Atlanta Braves , and the Chicago Cubs .  , The rivalry between the Philadelphia Phillies and the Pirates was considered by some to be one of the best rivalries in the National League.    The rivalry started when the Pittsburgh Pirates entered the NL in 1887, four years after the Phillies.  , The Phillies and the Pirates had remained together after the National League split into two divisions in 1969. During the period of two-division play (1969 to 1993), the two National League East division rivals won the two highest numbers of division championships, reigning almost exclusively as NL East champions in the 1970s and again in the early 1990s.    the Pirates nine, the Phillies six; together, the two teams' 15 championships accounted for more than half of the 25 NL East championships during that span.  , After the Pirates moved to the National League Central in 1994, the teams face each other only in two series each year and the rivalry has diminished.   However, many fans, especially older ones, retain their dislike for the other team and regional differences between Eastern and Western Pennsylvania still fuel the rivalry.  , The Pirates have had long standing if sometimes dormant rivalries with NL Central Division teams such as the Cincinnati Reds , St. Louis Cardinals , Milwaukee Brewers (with the The Sausage incident and the 'You can steal first' game) and the Chicago Cubs (with the Homer in the Gloamin' ). , Bullpen , Closer , Catchers , Infielders , Outfielders , , Pitchers , Catchers , Infielders , Outfielders , , Manager , Coaches , 60-day disabled list , , 25 active, 15 inactive , Milo Hamilton , Bob Prince , Throughout the 1940s Pirates owner William Benswanger was a leading advocate of integration of the Major Leagues, once planning a tryout for African American players to sign up for the club.  , The Pirates organization was the first in baseball to have both an African-American coach and manager, when Gene Baker broke the color line in 1961 and 1962 respectively. On September 21, 1963 the Pirates were the first MLB team to have an African-American manager in Gene Baker, as he filled in for Danny Murtaugh.  , On September 1, 1971, manager Murtaugh assembled a starting lineup that was completely composed of minorities for the first time in MLB history.  , Despite having some notable fans including former part-owner Bing Crosby , Michael Keaton and Regis Philbin ,  the Pirates are considered by most to be a distant third in Pittsburgh behind the Pittsburgh Steelers and Pittsburgh Penguins in popularity among Pittsburgh's three major professional sports teams . Many surveys have backed up this finding as well.  However, due to their long history in Pittsburgh dating back to the 1882 season, the team has retained a strong loyal following in the Pittsburgh region. , While the team's recent struggles compared to Pittsburgh's other two teams can be partly to blame (since the Pirates last World Series championship in 1979, the Steelers have won the Super Bowl and the Penguins the Stanley Cup three times each , including both in 2009 ), distractions off the field have also caused the team's popularity to slip in the city. While the team was ranked first in Pittsburgh as recent as the late 1970s,  the Pittsburgh drug trials in 1985 and two relocation threats since are believed to have also seen the team's popularity dipped.  The team's standing among fans has, however, improved since PNC Park opened in 2001.  , Each year, the Pirates recognize six \"Community Champions\" during a special pregame ceremony.  , Piratefest is a yearly event that is held by the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball club in January. The event is a baseball carnival for the whole family. It features autograph sessions from current and former Pirates players, live events and games, carnival booths such as dart throwing, baseball clinics, \"Ask Pirates Management\", and much more. Piratefest is held yearly at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center in downtown. It includes bouncy castles for kids and the Pittsburgh Pirate also attends.  , In 2007, the Pirates chose to end the longest relationship between a team and a radio station in American professional sports. KDKA first broadcast the Pirates on August 5, 1921; with Westinghouse foreman Harold Arlin behind the mic. Broadcasts ended in 1924, but returned in 1936. Except for a few years on WWSW in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the Pirates were on KDKA for 61 years. KDKA's 50,000-watt clear channel enabled Pirates fans across the eastern half of North America at night to hear the games. , That changed for the 2007 season, when the Pirates moved to FM talk radio station WPGB . The Pirates cited the desire to reach more people in the 25–54 age bracket coveted by advertisers. The acquisition of the rights means that Clear Channel Communications holds the rights to every major sports team in Pittsburgh. The Pirates have long had a radio network that has extended across four states. Stations for the 2007 season include Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, and Maryland radio broadcasters.  , On October 1, 2011, Clear Channel announced that they will not renew their deal with the Pirates. It was speculated that the club's radio broadcasting rights would likely be transferred back to CBS Radio via FM sports radio station KDKA-FM ,  which became official on October 12.  , Games are televised on Root Sports Pittsburgh , the Pirates' cable television outlet since 1986, when it was known as KBL. There has been no over-the-air coverage of the Pirates since 2002, when some games were on WCWB . KDKA-TV aired Pirates games for 38 years (1957–1994). Games aired on WPXI (1995-1996) and on WPGH-TV and WCWB (1997-2002). , Announcers Greg Brown , Bob Walk , John Wehner , and Steve Blass shuttle between the radio and TV booths. Also, Tim Neverett began calling Pirates games in 2009 after Lanny Frattare, also known as the voice of the Pirates, retired after the 2008 season. He was the longest working announcer in Pirates history (33 seasons). Neverett, has called NHL, MLB, and Olympic Games. Former Pirates closer Kent Tekulve , a member of the team's 1979 World Series Championship team , serves as a post-game analyst for the team on Root Sports Pittsburgh. , On October 1, 2008, longtime play-by-play announcer Lanny Frattare retired after 33 seasons, having called Pirates' games since the 1976 season. He is the longest-tenured announcer in Pirates' history, surpassing the man he replaced, the late Bob Prince (28 seasons, 1948–1975). , On December 18, 2008, the Pirates hired former Colorado Rockies broadcaster Tim Neverett as the new play-by-play announcer. Neverett joined Greg Brown in calling Pirates games on radio and television.  , 1888: \"Alleghenys\" Logo , 1900–1906 , 1907 , 1908–1909 , 1915–1919 , 1921, 1932 , 1922 , 1923–1931 , 1933–1935 , 1936–1947 , 1948–1959 , 1960–1967 , 1968–1986 , 1987–1996 , 1997–2013 ,  2014–present: Secondary Logo , 1997–2009: Alternate Logo , 2010–present: Alternate Logo , 2014–present , The Pirates have had many uniforms and logo changes over the years, with the only consistency being the \"P\" on the team's cap. It was adopted in 1948. Aside from style changes in the cap itself, the \"P\" logo has remained since. , The Pirates have long been innovators in baseball uniforms. In 1948, the team broke away from the patriotic \"Red, White, & Blue\" color scheme when they adopted the current black & gold color scheme, to match that of the colors of the Flag of Pittsburgh and, to a lesser extent at the time, the colors of the then-relatively unknown Pittsburgh Steelers of the NFL . While they were not the first baseball team to do this, they were one of the first to do this permanently. Along with the San Francisco Giants , the Pirates are one of two pre-expansion National League teams that completely changed their colors, although red returned as an \"accent color\" in 1997 and remained until 2009. , In the late 1950s, the team adopted sleeveless jerseys. While not an innovation by the team (that honor goes to the Cincinnati Reds ), the Pirates did help to popularize the look. The team brought back the vested jerseys in 2001, a style they retained until 2009, although the away jerseys said \"Pittsburgh\" in script instead of \"Pirates.\" In 2009, they introduced a new home, away and alternate black jersey all with sleeves. However, they kept the pinstriped sleeveless vest for Sunday home games. , To coincide with the move into Three Rivers Stadium in 1970, the team introduced pullover spandex uniforms, the first such team in baseball, and a look that would quickly be adopted by most other teams by the end of the decade. The Pirates ditched the pullover style in favor of the traditional button-down style in 1991, one of the last teams to switch. , The Pirates were also innovators in third jerseys . Even though it would be the Oakland A's that would beat them to having such jerseys, the Pirates, by 1977 had different uniform styles that included two different caps, two different undershirts, three different jerseys and three different pairs of trousers. They would actually rotate (and sometimes mix, with painful results) these styles daily until returning to the basic white and gray uniform ensemble in 1985 . , In 1976, the National League celebrated its 100th anniversary. To coincide with it, certain NL teams wore old-style pillbox hats complete with horizontal pinstripes . After the season, the Pirates were the only team to adopt the hats permanently, (alternating between a black hat and a gold hat for several seasons until keeping the black hat in 1985 ) and kept the hat through the 1986 season , which would be Barry Bonds rookie season with the team. The hats, which recall the team's last World Series championship season ( 1979 ), remain popular items in the throwback market. , The 2013 season will mark the last of the team's current logo, introduced in 1997 just after former owner Kevin McClatchy took over the team. The Pirates chose to use the \"P\" on their caps as the primary logo; however, the former logo will continue to be used as a secondary logo.  , On December 13, 2014, the Pirates unveiled a new camo alternate jersey which honors the soldiers in the Armed Forces, and will be worn on every home Thursday game.
