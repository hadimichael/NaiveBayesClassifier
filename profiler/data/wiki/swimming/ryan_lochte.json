His seven individual Olympic medals ranks near the top in men's swimming. As part of the American team, he holds the world record in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay (long course). Individually, he currently holds the world record in the 100-meter individual medley, 200-meter individual medley (long and short course), and the 400-meter individual medley (short course). , Lochte's success has earned him the World Swimmer of the Year Award and the American Swimmer of the Year Award twice. He has also been named the FINA Swimmer of the Year three times. He has won a total of 77 medals in major international competition, 49 gold, 17 silver, and 11 bronze spanning the Olympics, the World , Pan American , and Pan Pacific Championships. , Lochte specializes in the backstroke and individual medley, but is also a freestyle and butterfly swimmer. He is noted for the speed and distance he attains while kicking underwater. Lochte is also known for his dominance in the short course format (25-yard and 25-meter long swimming pools). , , , Lochte was born in Rochester, New York , the son of Ileana \"Ike\" ( née Aramburu) and Steven R. Lochte.  His mother is of Spanish and Basque ancestry and was born and raised in Havana , while his father is of German , Dutch and English descent.  He has two older sisters, Kristin, and Megan, and two younger brothers, Devon, and Brandon. During his early childhood, his family lived in Canandaigua, New York , but moved to Florida so his father could coach swimming. Lochte was taught to swim at the age of five by both of his parents. Ryan was often kicked out of his father's swimming classes for misbehaving, which often included pulling other children's legs, blowing bubbles, and hiding at the other end of the pool. Lochte only began taking swimming seriously when he was a junior in high school.  Steve Lochte said, \"I would send him to go shower when he was messing around. He spent more time in the showers than he did in the pool.\" At 14 years old, Ryan's loss at the Junior Olympics changed his attitude towards swimming: \"I suddenly said, 'I'm sick of losing'. After that I trained hard and I never lost there again.\"  , Lochte attended the University of Florida and graduated in 2007, majoring in sport management .  As a member of the Florida Gators swimming and diving team, he swam for coach Gregg Troy in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and Southeastern Conference (SEC) competition from 2004 to 2007.
