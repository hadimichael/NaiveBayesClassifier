However, his father insisted on him taking swimming lessons in that sports school, and in his own words, he has \"been stuck there ever since\". Popov started out as a backstroker but switched to freestyle when he joined Gennadi Touretski 's squad in 1990 on the initiative by the Head Coach of the USSR National Team Glep Petrov.  He later moved from Russia to Australia to be with his coach. , Popov won the men's 50 m and 100 m freestyle in the Barcelona Olympics in 1992, and repeated his victories in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics , becoming the first man to do so since Johnny Weissmuller . He presented Touretski with his 1996 Olympic gold medal from the 100 m freestyle. \"I have a title and I'm on the paper, but, you know, Gennadi hasn't gotten anything from Atlanta or from Barcelona,\" Popov said. \"But I know how much this particular medal means for him, is worth for him.\" , One month after the Atlanta Olympics, he was stabbed in the abdomen with a knife during a dispute with three Moscow street vendors. The knife sliced his artery, grazed one of his kidneys and damaged the pleura, the membrane that encases the lungs. He had emergency surgery and spent three months in rehabilitation. At the 1997 European Championships in Seville , Spain , he successfully defended his 50 m and 100 m freestyle titles. , In the 2003 Barcelona World Championships , Popov once again made a clean sweep of the men's 50 m and 100 m freestyle events, citing that Barcelona would always be special to him, for it was there that for him, everything first began. He announced his participation in the 2004 Athens Olympics . However, being the oldest competitor at the pool, the gold medal eluded him, and he did not even manage to make it into the finals of both the men's 50 m and 100 m freestyle events. He announced his retirement from the sport in January 2005.  , Popov was elected a full member of the International Olympic Committee in December 1999. He also represents the athletes on the IOC Sport for All Commission and was elected directly as one of seven athletes to the IOC Athletes' Commission by the athletes participating in the 1996 Olympics. He was re-elected to the Athletes Commission at the 2000 Games and is now Honorary Secretary. He was awarded the 1996 Russian Medal of Honour for contributions to sport. He was also named Russian Athlete of the Year and European Sports Press Union Athlete of the Year in 1996. , In June 2003, he confirmed that he was permanently leaving Australia in early 2004 to live in Solothurn , Switzerland . He said the move followed the offer of a business proposition in Switzerland, once he had retired from swimming. He retained Touretski as a long-distance coach. , Popov has both a Bachelor's and Master's Degrees in Sports Coaching from the Russian Academy. He is a spokesman for Omega SA . , He has recently appeared at the closing ceremony of the Beijing Olympics after being elected a member of the IOC, presenting flowers to volunteers. He has been named to the Evaluation Commission for the 2016 Summer Olympics .  , In 2009 he served as chairman of the RC Lokomotiv Moscow rugby league club.  , Since May 2009 he is a member of the supervisory board of Adidas .  , In early 1997 he married Darya Shmeleva , a Russian Olympic swimmer whom he had dated since 1995. They have two sons, Vladimir (b. 1997) and Anton (b. 2000), and a daughter, Mia (b. 22 December 2010).   , Popov is a friend of the legendary wrestler Aleksandr Karelin . "
