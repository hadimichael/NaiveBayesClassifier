She hit a 124.9 mph (201.0 km/h) serve at the French Open in 2007, the fifth fastest serve of all time on the WTA Tour.  However, from 2009 to 2012, her service game has largely been viewed as a liability instead of a weapon.

Ivanovic has dominated the majority of the rivalry. When asked why Ivanovic has posed such a problem for herself, Janković remarked that she struggles to read Ivanovic's game mostly due to the fact Ivanovic likes to play short points.  Ivanovic leads 2–1 on clay, 6–2 on hard courts and 1–0 on carpet courts. , The longest match contested between the two in the semi-finals at the East West Bank Classic in Los Angeles . In a match lasting two and a half hours, Ivanovic recovered from a 4–1 third set deficit, saving two match points en route, to defeat Janković on her way to the title.  The most significant match between the pair took place in the semi-finals of the French Open , with the winner having assured of becoming world No. 1 and with both women bidding to win their first Grand Slam title.

Both have openly admitted in the past to not liking each other.  and have been involved in a number of high-profile spats on and off court. Ivanovic was criticized both by Janković and her mother after Ivanovic decided to withdraw from Serbia's Fed Cup World Group play-off tie against Slovakia, citing her poor form in 2010  which left Jankovic the only high-profile player to play the tie which Serbia lost 3–2.  During the same weekend, Ivanovic was photographed having coffee with her boyfriend Adam Scott at the island resort of Palma, Majorca . Snezana Jankovic denounced Ivanovic in the Serbian press  whilst herself Jankovic later admitted she had been disappointed by Ivanovic's no show and said that Ivanovic should have at least supported the team for the bench even if she decided not to play.  Another high profile controversy was after the pair's first meeting in two years in the second round of the 2010 Mutua Madrilena Madrid Open in Madrid where the match was marred however by an incident in which off court cameras appeared to catch Janković mocking Ivanovic's trademark fistpumps towards her mother and camp after the match.  Jankovic admitted she found Ivanovic's fistpumps \"irritating\" but that it was not meant to be offensive and was in the heat of the moment.

Then, in the third set, Ivanovic was up 1–0 15–15 before she took a medical timeout, after which Sharapova took control of the set. Up 4–3 with a break, Sharapova double faulted on break point and sarcastically said to the umpire to \"check her blood pressure\" referring to the medical timeout that Ivanovic took earlier in the set.
