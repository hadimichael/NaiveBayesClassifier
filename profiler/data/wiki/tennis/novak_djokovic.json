By reaching the 2012 French Open final , he became the ninth player in the Open Era to reach the final of all four Grand Slam singles tournaments and became only the fifth to do so consecutively. Amongst other titles, he won the ATP World Tour Finals in 2008 , 2012 , 2013 , and 2014 and was on the Serbian team which won the 2010 Davis Cup . He also won the Bronze medal in men's singles at the 2008 Summer Olympics . He has won 24 Masters 1000 series titles, breaking a single-season record with five titles in 2011. This places him second on the list of Masters 1000 winners since its inception in 1990. , He holds several men's world records of the Open Era : becoming the youngest player in the Open Era to have reached the semifinals of all four Grand Slam events both separately and consecutively;  the first and only man to win three consecutive Australian Open titles in the Open Era, as well as the only man in the Open Era to win 5 Australian Open titles overall;  and playing the longest Grand Slam men's singles final in history (5 hours 53 minutes).  Djokovic's ATP tournament records include winning 31 consecutive ATP World Tour Masters 1000 series matches, playing in the finals at all nine ATP Masters 1000 tournaments (a record shared by Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal ), and being the only player to win eight.

He has won the ATP World Tour Player of the Year three times - in 2011, 2012 and 2014, and the ITF World Champion award four times consecutively, from 2011 to 2014. He is a recipient of the Order of St. Sava  and the Order of the Star of Karađorđe .  , , , Djokovic was born on 22 May 1987 in Belgrade , Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , to parents Srđan and Dijana ( née Žagar). His two younger brothers, Marko and Đorđe, are also tennis players with professional aspirations.  Residing in Monte Carlo , Djokovic was coached by former Slovak tennis player Marián Vajda from 2006 until Boris Becker took over the role of Head Coach in December 2013.  Similar to Roger Federer , Djokovic is a self-described fan of languages, speaking Serbian , English, French, German and Italian.   , He met his future wife, Jelena Ristić, in high school, and began dating her in 2005.  The two became engaged in September 2013  and on 10 July 2014 the couple got married on Sveti Stefan in Montenegro,  while a church wedding was held in the same place, on 12 July 2014, in the Church of Saint Stephen ( Serbian : Црква Светог Архиђакона Стефана ) which belongs to Praskvica Monastery .  On 24 April 2014, Djokovic announced that he and Ristić were expecting their first child.  His son Stefan was born on 21 October 2014.  , Djokovic began playing tennis at the age of four.  In the summer of 1993, the six-year-old was spotted by Yugoslav tennis player Jelena Genčić  at Mount Kopaonik , where Djokovic's parents ran a fast-food parlour.  Upon seeing Djokovic play tennis, she stated: \"This is the greatest talent I have seen since Monika Seleš .\"  Genčić worked with young Djokovic over the following six years before realizing that, due to his rapid development, going abroad in search of increased level of competition was the best option for his future. To that end, she contacted Nikola Pilić and in September 1999 the 12-year-old moved to the Pilić tennis academy in Oberschleißheim , Germany, spending four years there.  At the age of 14, he began his international career, winning European championships in singles, doubles, and team competition.  , Djokovic is known for his often humorous off-court impersonations of his fellow players, many of whom are his friends.  This became evident to the tennis world after his 2007 US Open quarterfinal win over Carlos Moyá , where he entertained the audience with impersonations of Rafael Nadal and Maria Sharapova . His impersonations have also become very popular on YouTube.  Djokovic also did an impression of John McEnroe after his fourth round match victory at the 2009 US Open , before playing a brief game with McEnroe, much to the delight of the audience.  Novak Djokovic is a member of the \"Champions for Peace\" club, a group of famous elite athletes committed to serving peace in the world through sport, created by Peace and Sport , a Monaco-based international organization.  , Djokovic adheres to Eastern Orthodoxy in the Serbian Orthodox Church . On 28 April 2011, Patriarch Irinej of Serbia awarded Djokovic the Order of St. Sava I class, the highest decoration of the Serbian Orthodox Church, because he demonstrated love for the church, and because he provided assistance to the Serbian people, churches and monasteries of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Kosovo .  Djokovic is a keen fan of Serbian football club Red Star Belgrade ,  Italian club A.C. Milan  and Portuguese club S.L. Benfica .  He is good friends with fellow Serbian tennis player Ana Ivanovic , whom he has known since the two were children growing up in Serbia, through Djokovic's uncle and Ivanovic's father.  , As a member of the Yugoslav national team, Djokovic reached the final of the 2001 Junior Davis Cup for players under 14, in which he lost his match in singles.  In juniors, Djokovic compiled a singles win/loss record of 40–11 (and 23–6 in doubles), reaching a combined junior world ranking of No. 24 in February 2004.  , Djokovic became a professional in 2003.  At the beginning of his professional career, he mainly played in Futures and Challenger tournaments, winning three of each type from 2003 to 2005. His first tour-level tournament was Umag in 2004, where he lost to Filippo Volandri in the round of 32.  , Djokovic made his first Grand Slam appearance by qualifying for the 2005 Australian Open , where he was defeated by eventual champion Marat Safin in the first round in straight sets, after defeating future rival Stanislas Wawrinka in qualifying .

Afterwards, Djokovic briefly considered moving from Serbia to play for Great Britain.  Following this match-up, the British media spoke of Djokovic's camp negotiating with the Lawn Tennis Association about changing his international loyalty by joining British tennis ranks.  The nineteen-year-old Djokovic, who was ranked sixty-third in the world at the time, mostly dismissed the story at first by saying that the talks were not serious, describing them as \"the British being very kind to us after the Davis Cup.\"  However, more than three years later, in October 2009, Djokovic confirmed that the talks between his family and the LTA throughout April and May 2006 were indeed serious: , Britain was offering me a lot of opportunities and they needed someone because Andy [Murray] was the only one, and still is. That had to be a disappointment for all the money they invest. But I didn't need the money as much as I had done. I had begun to make some for myself, enough to afford to travel with a coach, and I said, 'Why the heck?' I am Serbian, I am proud of being a Serbian, I didn't want to spoil that just because another country had better conditions. If I had played for Great Britain, of course I would have played exactly as I do for my country but deep inside, I would never have felt that I belonged. I was the one who took the decision .  , Djokovic began 2007 by defeating Australian Chris Guccione in the final of the tournament in Adelaide , before losing in the fourth round of the Australian Open to eventual champion Roger Federer  in straight sets. His performances at the Masters Series events in Indian Wells , and Key Biscayne , where he was the runner-up and champion respectively, pushed him into the world's top 10.

By reaching the semis, he also secured the year-end number 1 ranking for the third time, tying him with Nadal at fifth position. He was awarded the World Tour Finals trophy after Federer withdrew before the finals.  This marked the 7th title of the season for him and the 4th title at the World Tour Finals. , Djokovic began the season at the Qatar Open in Doha, where he won his first two rounds for the loss of just 6 games, however lost in the quarterfinals against Ivo Karlović in three tight sets. He rebounded from this defeat well at the Australian Open , where he made it through the first five rounds without dropping a set. In the semifinals he faced defending champion Stan Wawrinka , the man who beat him the previous year. He twice lost a set lead, however came roaring back in the fifth to take it to love, and set up a third final against Andy Murray .

He won the title for the fourth time at the Rome Masters , making it 4 out of 4 titles in Masters 1000 events entered by Djokovic in 2015. , He continued his good form on clay at the French Open , by reaching the final without dropping a set in the first five rounds, including a quarterfinal clash with Rafaël and a five set semifinal victory over 3rd seed Andy Murray which took two days to complete. This meant he became only the second man to have won against Nadal at the French Open. However, he lost the next match and the tournament to No. 8 seed Stan Wawrinka in four sets, after having prevailed in the first set and being up a break in the fourth set and up 40-0 on Wawrinka's serve in a subsequent game. He lost six of the final seven games of the match. With this loss, Djokovic was denied his first victory at the French Open and a personal career Grand Slam.  , Djokovic and Nadal have met 44 times, an Open Era record for head-to-head meetings between players,  with Nadal having a 23–21 advantage.   Nadal leads on grass 2–1 and clay 14–6, but Djokovic leads on hard courts 14–7.  This rivalry is listed as the third greatest rivalry in the last decade by ATPworldtour.com.  Djokovic is the first player to have at least ten match wins against Nadal and the only person to defeat Nadal seven times consecutively.

Federer ended Djokovic's 41-match winning start to the 2011 season at the 2011 French Open semifinals, which many consider to be a classic match.  However, he lost to Djokovic in the following year in straight sets.  Djokovic played Federer in his first Major final at the 2007 US Open and lost in three sets.  , Djokovic has the second-most wins against Federer (after Nadal). The two have met three times in Australian Open (in 2007, 2008, and 2011) which Federer won in straight sets in 2007 and Djokovic won in straight sets in the other 2. The two have met five years in a row at the US Open with Federer triumphant in their first three encounters while their last two meetings (in 2010 and 2011) were five-set matches in which Djokovic saved two match points before going on to win. On 6 July 2012, Djokovic lost to Federer in the Wimbledon semifinal.  On 12 November 2012, Djokovic won the 2012 ATP World Tour Finals by defeating Roger Federer in straight sets in the final.

They have met in five Grand Slam Finals: The 2011 Australian Open, the 2012 US Open,  the 2013 Australian Open, the 2013 Wimbledon Championships , and the 2015 Australian Open . Djokovic has won in Australia three times,  but it was Murray who emerged as the victor at the US Open and Wimbledon. , Djokovic and Murray also played a nearly five-hour-long semifinal match in the 2012 Australian Open, which Djokovic won 7–5 in the fifth set after Murray led 2 sets to 1. Murray and Djokovic met again in 2012 at the London 2012 Olympic Games, with Murray winning in straight sets. Djokovic won their three most recent meetings, including a three set thriller at the final of the Shanghai Masters , in which Murray held five championship point opportunities in the second set; however, Djokovic saved each of them, forcing a deciding set.  He eventually prevailed to win his first Shanghai Masters title, ending Murray's 12–0 winning streak at the event. The two met in the final of the 2013 Wimbledon Championships on 7 July 2013, second seed Murray defeated Djokovic in straight sets, the first time since 2010 that Djokovic had failed to win a set in a Grand Slam match. Their most recent meeting was in the semi finals of the 2015 French Open , where Djokovic defeated Murray in five sets after Murray threatened a comeback from 2 sets down. Since the start of 2014, Djokovic has dominated this rivalry, having won the last 8 matches between the two, losing only five sets in the process. , Djokovic and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga have met 19 times with Djokovic leading 13–6.   Their first meeting was in the final of the 2008 Australian Open ; Djokovic and Tsonga had defeated the top two players, Roger Federer  and Rafael Nadal  in their respective semi-finals in straight sets. Djokovic won this match in 4 sets to win his first Grand Slam singles title.  Tsonga then won their next four meetings, before Djokovic stopped the streak at Miami in 2009. , Their next meeting at a Grand Slam was again at the Australian Open , in the 2010 quarter-finals, exactly two years to the day since Djokovic defeated Tsonga to win his first Grand Slam singles title. However, this time it was Tsonga who prevailed, winning in five sets after Djokovic fell ill during the match.  It wouldn't be until another year-and-a-half until they met again, with the stakes even higher – in the semi-finals at Wimbledon in 2011, with the winner advancing to his first Wimbledon final. It was their first meeting on grass, and Djokovic prevailed in four sets to advance to his first Wimbledon final,  and in the process ending the seven-and-a-half-year reign of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal at the top of the rankings.

It was Djokovic's fifth win over Tsonga in 2012. , Their most recent Grand Slam meeting was in the fourth round of Wimbledon in 2014 . Djokovic won in straight sets.  They met again at the Rogers Cup later in the year, but this time it would be Tsonga who would win the most lopsided match of their rivalry, with Djokovic winning just four games. Prior to this victory Tsonga had lost his last nine matches and 18 sets to Djokovic.  , In this intriguing matchup, Djokovic leads 17–4, but the two have contested numerous entertaining matches, including four five-setters at Grand Slam level.  Wawrinka and Djokovic have played three consecutive Australian Open years, each match going to five sets, and a five-setter in the US Open: in the 2013 Australian Open fourth round, which Djokovic won 12–10 in a fifth set; at the 2013 US Open semifinals, which Djokovic won 6–4 in a fifth set; and at the 2014 Australian Open quarterfinals, which Wawrinka won 9–7 in a close fifth set. Wawrinka's win broke Djokovic's impressive run of 14 consecutive semifinals in Grand Slam play, ended a 28-match winning streak, and prevented Djokovic from capturing a record fifth Australian Open crown.  Djokovic got revenge in the 2015 Australian Open , winning 6-0 in the fifth set, but again it went the distance.  At the 2015 French Open final, Wawrinka defeated Djokovic in four sets. , Andre Agassi considers that Federer, Nadal and Djokovic \"may very well be the greatest three players to ever play tennis\".  Rod Laver chose Djokovic as number 6 in his top ten male players of the Open Era.  International Business Times puts him in the seventh place in the men's greatest players of all-time list  He is \"probably a top eight player in tennis history\" according to Tim Henman .  , Djokovic is widely considered to be one of the greatest returners in the history of the sport,  an accolade given to him even by Andre Agassi , who was considered to be the best returner ever. Tennis pundits have classified many of Djokovic's matches as some of the greatest matches ever, with the 2012 Australian Open final being considered the greatest match ever seen,  as a testament to his greatness as a tennis player. Some long time analysts claim that the Djokovic-Nadal rivalry ranks as the best rivalry in tennis history primarily because of the quality of matches they produce.  , Djokovic is an all-court player with emphasis on aggressive baseline play.  His groundstrokes from both wings are consistent, deep, and penetrating. His backhand is widely regarded as the best in today's game. His best shot is his backhand down the line, with great pace and precision. He is also known as one of the greatest movers on the court with superior agility, court coverage and defensive ability, which allows him to hit winners from seemingly defensive positions. After great technical difficulties during the 2009 season (coinciding with his switch to the Head racket series), his serve is one of his major weapons again, winning him many free points; his first serve is typically hit flat, while he prefers to slice and kick his second serves wide.  , Djokovic's return of serve is a powerful weapon for him, with which he can be both offensive and defensive. Djokovic is rarely aced because of his flexibility, length and balance. Djokovic is highly efficient off both the forehand and backhand return, often getting the return in play deep with pace, neutralizing the advantage the server usually has in a point. John McEnroe considers Djokovic to be the greatest returner of serve in the history of the men's game. Occasionally, Djokovic employs a well-disguised backhand underspin drop shot and sliced backhand. His drop shots still tend to be a drawback when hit under pressure and without proper preparation.  , Djokovic commented on the modern style of play, including his own, in interview with Jim Courier after his semifinal win against Andy Murray in the 2012 Australian Open tournament:  , I had a big privilege and honour to meet personally today Mr. Laver , and he is one of the biggest, and greatest players ever to play the game, thank you for staying this late, sir, thank you ... even though it would actually be better if we played a couple times serve and volley, but we don't know to play ... we are mostly around here [points to the area near the baseline], we are running, you know, around the baseline ... , Entering the pro circuit, Djokovic used the Head Liquidmetal Radical, but changed sponsors to Wilson in 2005. He couldn’t find a Wilson racquet he liked, so Wilson agreed to make him a custom racquet to match his previous one with Head.  After the 2008 season, Djokovic re-signed with Head, and debuted a new paint job of the Head YouTek Speed Pro at the 2009 Australian Open . He then switched to the Head YouTek IG Speed (18x20) paint job in 2011, and in 2013, he again updated his paint job to the Head Graphene Speed Pro, which included an extensive promotional campaign.  Djokovic uses a hybrid of Head Natural Gut (gauge 16) in the mains and Luxilon Big Banger ALU Power Rough (gauge 16L) in the crosses. He also uses Head Synthetic Leather Grip as a replacement grip.  In 2012, Djokovic appeared in a television commercial with Maria Sharapova promoting the use of Head rackets for many techniques such as golf and ten-pin bowling.  , After his 2011 victory in Montreal, tennis coach Nick Bollettieri stated that Djokovic is the most \"complete\" player of all time.  He has the backhand, forehand, serve, second serve, movement, mentality, and can play equally well on any surface. In assessing his 2011 season, Jimmy Connors said that Djokovic gives his opponents problems by playing \"a little bit old-school, taking the ball earlier, catching the ball on the rise, (and) driving the ball flat.\" Connors adds that a lot of the topspin that Djokovic's opponents drive at him comes right into his zone, thus his ability to turn defense into offense well.  , In the period 2004 and 2005, Djokovic was coached by Dejan Petrovic .  From fall 2005 until June 2006, he was coached by Riccardo Piatti who divided his time between the 18-year-old and Ivan Ljubičić . Player and coach reportedly parted ways over the latter's refusal to work full-time with Djokovic.  , Since June 2006, Djokovic has been coached by Slovakian former professional tennis player Marián Vajda . They met for the first time during that year's French Open, after which Vajda got hired to be the 19-year-old's coach. On occasion Djokovic employed additional coaches on part-time basis: in 2007, during the spring hardcourt season, he worked with Australian doubles ace Mark Woodforde with specific emphasis on volleys and net play while from August 2009 until April 2010 American Todd Martin joined the coaching team, a period marked by his ill-fated attempt to change Djokovic's serve motion.  , Since early 2007, Djokovic has been working with physiotherapist Miljan Amanović who was previously employed by Red Star Belgrade and NBA player Vladimir Radmanović .  , From the fall 2006, Djokovic had an Israeli fitness coach Ronen Bega, but the two parted ways during spring 2009  since Djokovic decided to make a change after identifying his conditioning as a weakness in his game following continual losses to Nadal.  In April 2009, ahead of the Rome Masters , Djokovic hired Austrian Gebhard Phil-Gritsch (formerly worked with Thomas Muster ) to join the team in fitness coach capacity.   , In July 2010, before the Davis Cup clash away at Croatia, Djokovic made another addition to his team – nutritionist Igor Četojević who additionally focuses on Chinese medicine and does acupuncture.  He discovered the tennis player suffers from gluten intolerance and cannot eat gluten , purging it from his diet. It appeared to have worked as Djokovic began feeling stronger, quicker, and much more fit.  After Djokovic's Wimbledon win in July 2011, Četojević left the team.  , After retiring from professional tennis in August 2011, Serbian player Dušan Vemić joined Djokovic's team as assistant coach for Novak.  , 6-time Grand Slam champion and former No. 1 Boris Becker then signed on with Djokovic, first coaching him at the 2014 Australian Open . , Djokovic endorses Serbian telecommunications company Telekom Srbija and German nutritional supplement brand FitLine.  , Since turning professional in 2003, Djokovic wore Adidas clothing and footwear. At the end of 2009, Djokovic signed a 10-year deal with the Italian clothing company Sergio Tacchini after Adidas refused to extend his clothing contract (choosing instead to sign Andy Murray ).  Since Sergio Tacchini doesn't make shoes, he continued with Adidas as his choice of footwear. Djokovic's sponsorship contract with Tacchini was incentive heavy, and due to Djokovic's disproportionate success and dominance in 2011, the company fell behind on bonus payments, leading to the termination of the sponsorship contract.   From 2011, Djokovic began to wear custom Red and Blue Adidas Barricade 6.0's shoes, referring to the colours of the Serbian national flag. In April 2012, he was set to join forces with Nike, Inc. ,  but instead, on 23 May 2012, Uniqlo appointed Djokovic as its global brand ambassador. The five-year sponsorship reportedly worth €8 million per year,  began on 27 May 2012 in Paris' Roland-Garros French Open Tennis Tournament. , Djokovic did television commercial spots and print ads for supermarket chain Idea, the Serbian arm of Croatian supermarket retailer Konzum as well as for rival Serbian supermarket chain DIS Trgovina. , In August 2011, Djokovic became the brand ambassador of Swiss watch manufacturer Audemars Piguet .  Less than a month later, Djokovic signed a sponsorship deal with German car company Mercedes-Benz .  In March 2012, Djokovic was announced by Bombardier Aerospace as its latest Learjet brand ambassador, thus joining the likes of actor and pilot John Travolta , architect Frank Gehry , maestro Valery Gergiev , and classical pianist Lang Lang .  , Since 2004, the business end of Djokovic's career has been handled by Israeli managers Amit Naor (former pro tennis player turned sports agent) and Allon Khakshouri, the duo that also had Marat Safin and Dinara Safina as their clients. In June 2008, after the duo entered into partnership with CAA Sports, the sports division of Hollywood talent firm Creative Artists Agency , meaning that the famous company started representing tennis players for the first time,  Djokovic formally signed with CAA Sports .  After Djokovic's contract with CAA Sports expired during summer 2012, he decided to switch representation, announcing IMG Worldwide as his new representatives in December 2012.  , In 2005, as Djokovic moved up the tennis rankings, he ventured into the business world. His family founded a legal entity in Serbia named Family Sport. Registered as a limited liability company , its initial focus was the restaurant business. The company's day-to-day operations are mostly handled by Novak's father Srdjan and uncle Goran expanded its activities into real estate, sports/entertainment event organization, and sports apparel distribution.  , The company opened theme cafés named Novak Café, as well as Novak Café & Restaurant in the Belgrade's municipality of Novi Beograd . , In February 2008, the company reached an agreement with local authorities in the city of Kragujevac about jointly entering into a real estate development deal that was to include 4 hectares of city-owned land at Veliki Park being developed into a tennis center with 14 courts. But by 2010 the company pulled out of these plans.   , In March 2008, Family Sport won a municipal authority-organized tender in Novi Beograd by submitting an €11 million bid for the 3.8 hectares of land located in Ivan Ribar neighbourhood;  with the ambitious plan to build a big tennis center there.    As of spring 2013, construction is yet to commence. , In 2009, the company managed to buy an ATP tournament known as the Dutch Open and bring it to Serbia where it became – Serbia Open . With the help of Belgrade city authorities, the tournament's inaugural edition was held during May 2009 at the city-owned 'Milan Gale Muškatirović' courts, located at an attractive spot in Dorćol neighbourhood.  In 2012, after four tournament editions, the company pulled out of the venture and Serbia Open ceased to exist. , On Monday, 4 July 2011, one day after Djokovic won Wimbledon, Family Sport organized the homecoming reception in front of the National Assembly building with more than 80,000 people gathering to greet him.   , It was announced in late 2012 that Djokovic had purchased the entire existing 2013 production of donkey cheese, which is produced by a single farm in Serbia. This was done to ensure a reliable supply for his chain of restaurants in Serbia.  , Owing to his extroverted personality, fluency in several languages, and willingness to go along with comedic concepts, Djokovic became a fixture on entertainment-based TV talk shows around the globe immediately upon achieving a measure of prominence via results on the tennis court.   After winning the Australian Open, his first major, in early 2008, Djokovic appeared on the American late-night programme The Tonight Show with Jay Leno .   In May 2008, he was a special guest during the first semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest , held in Belgrade that year. He threw a big tennis ball into the crowd, announcing the start of the voting and together with one of the show's co-presenters, Željko Joksimović , Djokovic sang a song about Belgrade.  , Throughout late April and early May 2009, during ATP Master Series tournaments in Rome and Madrid , respectively, the Serb was a guest on the Fiorello Show hosted by Italian comedian Rosario Fiorello  followed by an appearance on Pablo Motos ' show El Hormiguero .  During the week off, in-between the two tournaments, Djokovic came home to Belgrade where he was interviewed by Nenad Lj. Stefanović on the RTS ' hour-long, one-on-one Serbian talk programme Svedok .  In 2009, and 2010, Djokovic won an Oscar of Popularity for the most popular male athlete in Serbia.  , Djokovic is also featured in the music video for the song \" Hello \" by Martin Solveig and Dragonette . The video, filmed at Stade Roland Garros , shows Solveig facing off against Bob Sinclar , another DJ, in a tennis match. When the referee calls a crucial ball \"Out\", Djokovic enters the arena and convinces the referee otherwise.  In 2010, the Serbian blues-rock band Zona B recorded the song \"The Joker\", dedicating it to Djokovic.   , Djokovic's international television appearances particularly intensified during his successful 2011 season. After winning Wimbledon and reaching the number one spot on the ATP list, he again appeared on Leno's Tonight Show as well as on Conan O'Brien 's show on TBS .  Djokovic's dramatic win at the US Open was followed by another television blitz including spots on Live with Regis and Kelly , CBS ' The Early Show , NBC 's Today as well as a walk-on appearance on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon .  On 25 June 2011, its seventieth Congress in Chicago, all the members unanimously awarded Djokovic the Order of Serbian National Defense in America I class, the highest decoration of the SND. The order was given to him because of his merits in the international sport scene and his contributions to the reputation of Serbs and Serbia around the world.  In mid-November 2011, he made a triumphant return to Rai 1 's Il più grande spettacolo dopo il weekend , hosted by Fiorello.

He won 41 straight matches from the start of 2011 until the French Open semi-finals,  second only to John McEnroe 's record (he started 42–0 in 1984).  , Novak Djokovic is one of only four players (besides David Nalbandian , Andy Murray , and Rafael Nadal ) to beat Roger Federer three times in one calendar year, and one of only two players ( Juan Martin Del Potro being the other) to beat both Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal in a Grand Slam in consecutive matches.
