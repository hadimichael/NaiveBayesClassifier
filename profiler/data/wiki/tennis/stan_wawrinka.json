After the match, reports emerged that Federer and Wawrinka had a heated discussion lasting for 10 minutes in the gym at the O2, after officials reportedly told them to resolve their differences after a flare-up in the tunnel. The spat was reportedly caused by Mirka Federer 's calling Wawrinka a crybaby.    , The pair appeared as friends though when they met for the Davis Cup final.  In the final against France, Wawrinka gave his country the perfect start by defeating Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in four sets.

The match ended a sequence of four doubles rubbers losses for the pair, and it was their first win together on clay. Wawrinka did not play on the final day, as Federer sealed the tie, by beating Gasquet in straight sets for Switzerland's first Davis Cup title.

He defeated Djokovic in four sets, after being down a break in the fourth set and 0-40 in a subsequent game.  He broke Djokovic's service twice in the set, reeling off six of the final seven games of the match. With this victory, Wawrinka claimed his second Grand Slam tournament title, and Djokovic failed to win a personal career Grand Slam.

Not since Sergi Bruguera beat no. 1 seed Pete Sampras and no. 2 seed Jim Courier at the 1993 French Open had a male tennis player defeated the top 2 seeds at a Grand Slam tournament. Wawrinka accomplished this feat not only once, but twice: first at the 2014 Australian Open , then at the 2015 French Open .

His forehand, considered a weakness early in his career, has improved significantly and is a now a big weapon in his game. , In 2013, he began working with new coach Magnus Norman . This partnership has been credited with improvement in Wawrinka's performance in important matches and was evident in his victories over Andy Murray at the 2013 US Open , and Novak Djokovic at the 2014 Australian Open (both were defending champions), as well as his improved consistency. Wawrinka's mental game has also been seen to improve over time, culminating in his win over No. 1 seed Rafael Nadal at the 2014 Australian Open in which Wawrinka survived a fightback from Nadal to clinch the title. He also survived a fightback from No. 1 seed Novak Djokovic at the 2015 French Open final, being down one break of serve in the fourth set, before breaking Djokovic's service twice to clinch the title. , Wawrinka's father, Wolfram, is a German of Czech ancestry, although his surname is actually of Polish origin.
