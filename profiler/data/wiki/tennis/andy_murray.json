However, he subsequently lost to Rafael Nadal in straight sets.  After losing the 2014 French Open semi-finals to Rafael Nadal, Murray appointed former women's world number one, and two-times slam titlist, Amelie Mauresmo as his coach  in a 'historic move' which made Mauresmo the first woman to coach a top male tennis player.  , After strong grass court seasons in 2012 and 2013, Murray was seeded third for the 2014 Wimbledon Championship, behind Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal, who are seeded first and second respectively.

Murray continued his good form, defeating Roberto Bautista Agut  and Kevin Anderson ,  the 27th and 20th seeds, again in straight sets to reach his seventh consecutive Wimbledon quarterfinal. Murray's defence then came to a halt as Grigor Dimitrov ended his 17 match winning-streak on the grass of Wimbledon (this includes the 2012 Olympics) with a straight sets win, meaning Murray failed to reach the semi-finals for the first time since 2008.  After his defeat at the Championships, Murray dropped to 10th in the world, his lowest ranking since 2008.  , Prior to the North American hard court swing, Murray announced he was extending his partnership with Amélie Mauresmo until the end of the US Open , but was ideally looking for a long-term deal.

Victories over Somdev Devvarman , Lukáš Lacko and Juan Mónaco saw Murray reach his first final of the season, breaking a drought of 14 months following his title at Wimbledon. In the final he faced Tommy Robredo of Spain, the second final between the two. After saving five championship points in the second set tie break, Murray went on to win the title in three sets, Robredo's drop in fitness ultimately proving decisive.  He then took his good form into Beijing , where he reached the semifinals before losing to Djokovic in straight sets,  however he lost in the third round at the Shanghai Masters to David Ferrer despite being a set up.  Following his early exit in Shanghai, Murray took a wildcard into the Vienna Open in an attempt to claim a place at the ATP World Tour Finals . He reached the final, where he once again faced Ferrer, and triumphed in three sets for his second title of the season, and the 30th of his career.  Murray defeated Ferrer again in the semi-finals of the Valencia Open to move into his third final in five weeks, and further strengthen his bid for a place at the season finale in London.  In a repeat of the Shenzhen Open final, Murray again saved five championship points as he overcame Tommy Robredo in three sets.  Murray then went on to reach the quarter-finals of the Paris Masters , where he was eliminated by Djokovic in what was his 23rd match in the space of only 37 days.  However, his win over Dimitrov in the third round had already guaranteed him a spot at the ATP World Tour Finals.  , At the ATP World Tour Finals , Murray lost his opening round robin match to Kei Nishikori  but won his second match against Milos Raonic .  However, he lost his final group match against Federer in straight sets and only managed to win one game against him, marking his worst defeat since losing to Djokovic in the 2007 Miami Masters , eliminating him from the tournament.  Despite the loss, his late-season run had already propelled him back up the rankings to number 6 in the world, his best ranking since June. , Following the conclusion of the season, Murray mutually agreed a split with long-term backroom staff, training partner Dani Vallverdu and fitness coach Jez Green. They had been with him for five and seven years respectively but were both reported to have been unhappy at the lack of consultation they had been given about the appointment of Mauresmo.

He went on to lose the final to Djokovic, this time in three sets.  Murray added Jonas Björkman to his coaching staff in March initially on a five-week trail to help out in periods when Mauresmo was unavailable as she only agreed to work with him for 25 weeks.  However, at the end of the Australian Open, Mauresmo had informed Murray that she was pregnant and he announced at the end of April, that Björkman would be his main coach for all of the grass court season and all of the US hard court swing, while Mauresmo would only be with the team for Wimbledon.  , Murray won his first ATP clay court title at the 2015 BMW Open .

In the final, he defeated Rafael Nadal in straight sets for his first Madrid title on clay, and first ever clay court Masters 1000 title.

They have met in five Major finals: The 2011 Australian Open, the 2012 US Open, the 2013 Australian Open, the 2013 Wimbledon Championships, and the 2015 Australian Open. Djokovic has won in Australia three times, and Murray emerged as the victor at the US Open and Wimbledon. The former of Murray's victories was the longest ever final at the US Open , tying with the 1988 final played between Ivan Lendl and Mats Wilander at 4 hours and 53 minutes, whilst the latter was notable for being the first home triumph in men's singles at Wimbledon since 1936. , They also played a nearly five-hour long semifinal match in the 2012 Australian Open, which Djokovic won 7–5 in the fifth set after Murray led 2 sets to 1.

He eventually prevailed to win his first Shanghai Masters title, ending Murray's 12–0 winning streak at the event. The three set matches they played in Rome and Shanghai in 2011 and 2012 respectively were voted the ATP World Tour Match of the Year for each respective season.   Due to the tight competition between 2008 and 2013, many saw this as the emerging rivalry, as the two are both in their prime years, and are both likely to be playing for at least another five years.   However, Djokovic went on to dominate the rivalry after the 2013 Wimbledon final, winning all their last 8 meetings.

Murray defeated Federer in straight sets to win the gold medal, denying Federer a Career Golden Slam . In 2013 Murray beat Federer for the first time in a Major in the semi-finals of the Australian Open , prevailing in five sets after Federer had come back twice from a set down.  Their last grand slam meeting was at Australian Open 2014 quarter finals where Federer defeated Murray in straight sets. Murray is one of only three players to have recorded 10 or more victories over Federer, the other two being Nadal and Djokovic.

His playing style has been likened to that of Miloslav Mečíř . Murray also has one of the best two-handed backhands on the tour, with dynamic stroke execution.  Tim Henman has stated that Murray may now have the best lob in the game, succeeding Lleyton Hewitt .  In addition to this, Murray is a good volleyer and executes a fine drop shot although his selection in the drop shots are sometimes questionable against faster players like Roger Federer .   , Murray's tactics usually involve passive exchanges from the baseline. He is capable of injecting sudden pace into his groundstrokes to surprise his opponents who are used to the slow rally. Murray is also one of the top returners in the game, often able to block back fast serves with his excellent reach and ability to anticipate. For this reason, Murray is rarely aced.  Murray is known for being one of the most intelligent tacticians on the court, often constructing points.   Murray is most proficient on a fast surface,  like grass, where he has won six singles titles including the Wimbledon Championships and the 2012 Olympic Gold Medal . He has worked hard since 2008 on improving his clay court game,  ultimately winning his first clay titles during 2015 at Munich and Madrid . While Murray has a strong first serve, reaching speeds of 130 mph or higher on some occasions, one of his weaknesses is an inconsistent second serve. Since Ivan Lendl's coaching between 2011 and 2014, he has worked to improve his second serve, returns and mental game, resulting in a more offensive game.   , In 2009 German manufacturer Adidas and Murray signed a five-year-deal worth £30 million. This included wearing their range of tennis shoes.  The contract with Adidas allowed Murray to keep his shirt sleeve sponsors Shiatzy Chen , Royal Bank of Scotland and Highland Spring .

As a result of his various charitable exploits, Murray was awarded the Arthur Ashe Humanitarian of the Year award for 2014. , Murray identifies himself as Scottish and British .  His national identity has often been commented on by the media.  Whilst making a cameo appearance on comedy show Outnumbered , Murray is asked whether he is British or Scottish, to which he responds \"It depends if I'm winning\".  Much of the discussion about Murray's national identity began prior to Wimbledon 2006 , when he was quoted as saying he would \"support anyone but England \" at the 2006 World Cup . English ex-tennis player Tim Henman confirmed that the remarks had been made in jest and were only in response to Murray being teased by journalist Des Kelly and Henman.  , Murray initially refused to endorse either side of the debate in the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence , citing the abuse he had received after his comments in 2006.  Just before the referendum, Murray tweeted what was considered by the media an endorsement of the yes vote. [ a ]    He received some abuse for expressing his opinion, including messages that were described as \"vile\" by Police Scotland ; one referred to the Dunblane massacre.

Having been given a warning for racket abuse , he went on in the post-match interview to state that he and Carlsen had \"played like women\" during the first set.  Murray was booed for the remark, but explained later that the comment had been intended as a jocular response to what Svetlana Kuznetsova had said at the Hopman Cup .  A few months later, Murray was fined for swearing at the umpire during a Davis Cup doubles rubber with Serbia and Montenegro Davis Cup team . Murray refused to shake hands with the umpire at the end of the match.  , In 2007, Murray suggested that tennis had a match-fixing problem, stating that everyone knows it goes on,  in the wake of the investigation surrounding Nikolay Davydenko .
