  "article": "Serena Jameka Williams (born September 26, 1981) is an American professional tennis player who is ranked No. 1 in women's singles tennis . The Women's Tennis Association (WTA) has ranked her World No. 1 in singles on six separate occasions. She became the World No. 1 for the first time on July 8, 2002, and achieved this ranking for the sixth time on February 18, 2013, becoming the oldest world No. 1 player in WTA's history.  She is the reigning Australian Open , French Open , US Open , WTA Tour Championships and Olympic women's singles champion.  Williams is widely recognized by many tennis legends and commentators as the greatest women's tennis player of all time.    , Frequently hailed as the \"Queen of the Court\" by the general media,     Williams holds the most major singles, doubles, and mixed doubles titles combined amongst active players, male or female. Her record of 35 Grand Slam titles puts her seventh on the all-time list: 20 in singles, 13 in women's doubles, and two in mixed doubles. She is the most recent player, male or female, to have held all four Grand Slam singles titles simultaneously (2002–03), and the fifth woman ever to do so. She is also the most recent player together with her sister Venus Williams to have held all four Grand Slam women's doubles titles simultaneously (2009–10). Her total of 20 Grand Slam singles titles is third on the all-time list behind Margaret Court (24) and Steffi Graf (22 titles),  and second in the Open Era , behind only Graf.  She has won 13 Grand Slam doubles titles with her sister Venus and the pair are unbeaten in Grand Slam finals.  Williams is also a five-time winner of the WTA Tour Championships .  The arrival of the Williams sisters has been credited with launching a new era of combined power and athleticism in women's tennis.     Williams has won four Olympic gold medals , one in women's singles and three in women's doubles, an all-time record shared with her sister Venus Williams.   , , , Serena Williams was born in Saginaw, Michigan , USA to Richard Williams and Oracene Price and is the youngest of Price's five daughters: half-sisters Yetunde , Lyndrea and Isha Price, and full sister Venus .  When the children were young, the family moved to Compton, California , where Williams started playing tennis at the age of three.   Her father home-schooled Serena and her sister Venus   and, to this day, Williams was and remains coached by both her parents.  Williams's family moved from Compton to West Palm Beach, FL  when she was nine so that she could attend the tennis academy of Rick Macci, who would provide additional coaching. Rick Macci spotted the exceptional talents of the sisters. He did not always agree with Williams's father, but respected that \"he treated his daughters like kids, allowed them to be little girls\".  Richard stopped sending his daughters to national junior tennis tournaments when Williams was 10, since he wanted them to take it slow and focus on school work. Another factor was racial, as he had heard white parents talk about the Williams sisters in a derogatory manner during tournaments.  At that time, Williams had a 46–3 record on the United States Tennis Association junior tour and was ranked No. 1 among under-10 players in Florida.  In 1995, when Williams was in the ninth grade, her father pulled his daughters out of Macci's academy and, from then on, took over all coaching at their home. When asked in 2000 whether having followed the normal path of playing regularly on the junior circuit would have been beneficial, Williams responded: \"Everyone does different things. I think for Venus and I, we just attempted a different road, and it worked for us.\"  In 2003 sister Yetunde was fatally shot in an SUV after a confrontation with youths in Compton.   , Williams is primarily a baseline player and her game is built around taking immediate control of rallies with her powerful and consistent serve,  return of serve, and forceful groundstrokes from both her forehand and backhand swings. Williams's forehand is considered to be among the most powerful shots in the women's game as is her double-handed backhand. Williams strikes her backhand groundstroke using an open stance, and uses the same open stance for her forehand. Williams's aggressive play, a \"high risk\" style, is balanced in part by her serve, which is considered to be the greatest in women's tennis history.    She consistently projects great pace in her serves and in the 2013 Australian Open, she had a peak serve speed of 128.6 mph (207.0 km/h) which is the third fastest all-time among female players (only Venus's 129 mph  and Sabine Lisicki 's 131 mph  recorded speeds are faster). What makes her serve even more deadly is her ball placement and her ability to consistently place powerful shots with great accuracy.  At the 2012 Wimbledon Championships, Serena hit a women's tournament record of 102 aces which was more than any of the men hit during the two weeks.  Williams also possesses a very solid and powerful overhead. Her main weakness is her volley and slice. Although many think of Williams as only an offensive player, she also plays a strong defensive game.  , Williams is also known for her mental toughness and her ability to come back from improbable situations.   She has won three Grand Slam singles titles after saving match points (2003 Australian Open versus Kim Clijsters, 2005 Australian Open versus Maria Sharapova, and 2009 Wimbledon versus Elena Dementieva), more than any other player in history, male or female.  In the 2012 US Open final against Victoria Azarenka , she was down 5–3 in the third set and found herself two points away from losing the match. Williams then proceeded to win the next 4 games and defeated Azarenka.  She also came back from a 3-5 deficit in the third set against Kim Clijsters in the 1999 US Open and went on to win her first Grand Slam singles title. In recent years, Williams has shown an ability to serve aces at critical moments. One of these instances was the 2013 French Open final, where in the last game of the match, she fired three aces, including one clocked at 123 mph (198 km/h) on match point.   , Williams's first professional event was in September 1995, at the age of 14 to counteract the forthcoming changes to age-eligibility rules, at the Bell Challenge .

Serena Williams was voted WTA Player of the Year for the fourth time.  Based on her brilliant show in 2012, Serena was also named International Tennis Federation World Champion.  Williams also returned to doubles competitions with Venus; in the pair's first tournament since 2010 Wimbledon , they claimed their fifth Wimbledon doubles title and the 13th grand slam doubles title.  The pair successfully defended their Olympic doubles title which meant that they became the only tennis players to win four gold medals.  , Williams's first tournament of the 2013 season was in Brisbane , where she won the title without dropping a set. Williams was upset in the quarterfinals of the 2013 Australian Open by fellow American player Sloane Stephens .

Williams went on to lose to Victoria Azarenka in the final. In Miami, Williams lost a set to Maria Sharapova , in the final, for the first time since 2008. However, this setback did not stop Williams who recorded her seventieth come-from-behind win. The win made Williams a six-time champion in Miami breaking the record she held with Steffi Graf and became only the fourth woman in the open era to have won a tournament at least six times.  Williams successfully defended her Charleston title winning it for the third time overall.  Williams won her fiftieth career singles title in Madrid , defeating Sharapova in the final. Williams then played Rome, where she won the title without dropping a set, defeating Victoria Azarenka in the final to take her second title. Williams only dropped ten games in reaching the quarterfinals at Roland Garros. There, she played Svetlana Kuznetsova and lost her first set of the tournament.

After the US Open, Williams headed to Beijing where she beat Jelena Jankovic to win the China Open for her 10th title of 2013.   Williams went through the WTA championships undefeated winning the final against Li Na, to become the first person to defend the title since Justine Henin in 2007. Williams won her eleventh title of the year becoming the eighth player to win eleven tournaments or more in a year and the first since Martina Hingis in 1997.  Additionally Williams became the oldest person to win the WTA Championships and the fourth player to win the event four times or more. By winning the championship Williams became the first woman to win more than ten million dollars in a season and with her total of $12,385,572, only Rafael Nadal , in 2013 and Novak Djokovic , in 2011, 2012 and 2013, have earned more money in a single season.  Williams finished as the year end world number one for the third time.  She was also named the 2013 ITF World Champion the fourth time that she has been given the World Champion's crown.

Alizé Cornet defeated Williams for the second time the year in the third round of Wimbledon , thus handing Serena her earliest Wimbledon exit since 2005 . Serena was then forced to withdraw from the doubles event alongside sister Venus Williams while trailing 0–3 in the second round. A disoriented Serena hit 4 consecutive doubles faults and was having trouble with both her ball toss and movement before being removed from what has been described as one of the most unusual scenes ever seen in tennis.    , Williams rebounded by winning 19 out of her next 20 matches (losing only to sister Venus ). This streak include titles at the Bank of the West Classic as well as her first Western & Southern Open title and, finally, her third consecutive and sixth overall US Open singles title   which she won without having dropped a set. With this victory Serena tied Chris Evert for most singles titles won by a woman at the US Open in the Open Era . Williams also tied Evert and Martina Navratilova 's 18 Grand Slam singles titles won in the Open Era. By virtue of having won both the US Open and the US Open Series , Williams collected $4,000,000 – the biggest payday in tennis history. This pushed her career prize money earnings past the $60,000,000 mark.  Serena's 12 match winning streak came to an end in the second round of the Wuhan Open when a viral illness forced her to retire while up a break in the first set against Alizé Cornet .

At the Australian Open Williams defeated Maria Sharapova of Russia for the sixteenth consecutive time to claim her 6th Australian Open singles title and 19th career Grand Slam singles title, winning the title on her third match point in the second set.      With this victory Williams surpassed both Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova for second most Grand Slam singles titles won in the Open Era . The title was also her sixth Grand Slam singles title since turning 30 years of age, three more than the next closest to do so ( Margaret Court , Martina Navratilova with three each). She is the only player in history to win all four Grand Slams at least once after having turned 30. The following weekend, Serena and sister Venus traveled to Buenos Aires, Argentina to face Argentina in a World Group II tie for Fed Cup . She played and won her only match against Maria Irigoyen to help Team USA to a 4-1 win over Argentina.  Williams announced that she would be competing at the Indian Wells Masters ending her 14-year boycott of the event.   Upon her return Williams received a standing ovation from the crowd and won her first match in straight sets.  She reached the semifinals, where she was due to face world no. 3 Simona Halep for a place in the final, but was forced to withdraw because of a right knee injury. By virtue of having defeated Sabine Lisicki in the quarterfinals of the Miami Open , Serena became one of only eight women in the Open Era to record 700 match wins in her career.  This also makes her one of only three active players to have won 700 or more matches in singles, the others being Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal .  In the semifinals she won against Halep to advance to her tenth final at the event,  where she won a record eighth title and extended her winning streak to 21 matches by beating Carla Suárez Navarro .    , As preparation for the clay court season (and to ensure her eligibility for the 2016 Summer Olympics), Williams travelled to Brindisi, Italy to face Italy for a place in the Fed Cup 's World Group. Williams lost the decisive doubles match alongside Alison Riske to Sara Errani and Flavia Pennetta and as a result the United States were relegated to World Group II. It was Williams' first loss in the Fed Cup.  However, she maintained her perfect record in singles by defeating Camila Giorgi and Errani. The week of April 20 marked Serena's 114th consecutive week ranked world no. 1 - the third-longest run in WTA history behind Steffi Graf 's 186 weeks and Martina Navratilova 's 156. Williams suffered her first defeat of the season in the semifinals of the Mutua Madrid Open to world no. 4 Petra Kvitová .   This loss ended a 27 match winning streak for Williams as well as a 50 match winning streak at Premier Mandatory events and also a 19 match winning streak at the particular event.  Williams played one match at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia before withdrawing from the tournament with an elbow injury.  By virtue of having defeated Victoria Azarenka in the third round of the French Open , Williams became the first woman in the Open Era to win 50 matches at all four of the Grand Slams.  Williams then defeated Sloane Stephens to reach her 40th Grand Slam singles quarterfinal.  Serena won her next match easily, but then had to come back from a set down in the semifinals versus Timea Bacsinszky for the fourth time in her past five matches to reach the final.   She would go on to defeat Lucie Šafářová from the Czech Republic in three sets to win her 3rd French Open and 20th Grand Slam singles title.    The win made her only the third person in history to win each major at least three times, joining Margaret Court and Steffi Graf . She's the first player to win three straight majors since she did it herself during the Serena Slam. She is also the first player to win the Australian-French Open double since Jennifer Capriati in 2001.  , Williams has played older sister Venus in 25 professional matches since 1998. Overall Williams is 14–11 against her sister. Serena has played Venus 12 times in Grand Slam singles tournaments and 12 times in other tournaments (including 11 finals). They have met in eight Grand Slam finals, with Serena winning six times. Beginning with the 2002 French Open , they played each other in four consecutive Grand Slam singles finals, which was the first time in the open era that the same two players had contested four consecutive Grand Slam finals. , When the Williams sisters both entered the top ten and started meeting in tournaments, unsubstantiated rumors of match fixing started to circulate. John McEnroe , while commenting on the 2000 Wimbledon semifinal between the two sisters, said that \"Serena may not be allowed to win. Richard may have something to say about this.\"  Elena Dementieva , a fellow professional player, said during a post match interview after losing to Venus at the Indian Wells quarterinals in 2001, that Richard Williams decided the results between the two sisters.  , After injuring herself in the quarterfinal match against Dementieva, Venus Williams defaulted to Serena in the semifinals. Although she claimed to have told the tournament official hours beforehand that she would have to default, the official word is that it was 10 minutes before the scheduled start, angering fans who had come to see the match. Consequently, during the final against Kim Clijsters two days later, the spectators jeered Serena from when she first took the court for warm-up through the final trophy presentation including cheering double faults and errors with no intervention from the tournament officials. At the Ericsson Open the following week, Richard Williams said racist comments were made to him in the stands,  and the tournament director refused to offer Serena an apology for how she was treated. As a result, neither sister played the tournament even though since then it had become a mandatory stop on the WTA tour in 2009. In 2015, Serena decided to end her 14-year boycott and entered the tournament.  , In her 2004 U.S. Open quarterfinal match against Jennifer Capriati , an overrule was made by chair umpire Mariana Alves in Capriati's favor, even though later video review showed this to be an error (as Williams's shot was inside the court). This was one of several calls that incorrectly went against Williams throughout the match, including during a crucial point. Williams attempted to argue the call, but was not successful. Capriati won the match, but tournament officials dismissed the umpire from the tournament. The controversy renewed calls for the adoption of technology like the MacCam and Hawk-Eye systems.  , In 2009, Williams again was involved in a controversial U.S. Open match, this time against Kim Clijsters in the semifinal round. The drama began at the end of the first set, when Williams slammed her racquet on the court in frustration over losing the set. She was given a warning, with a potential second violation carrying a one-point penalty. While trailing 4–6, 5–6, 15–30, Williams's second serve was called a foot fault , resulting in two match points for Clijsters. Williams gestured with her racquet to the lineswoman who had made the call and yelled at her, with profanities and an injury threat.  During the subsequent on-court conference between the chair umpire, the lineswoman, US Open officials, and Williams, a television microphone picked up Williams saying to the lineswoman, \"I didn't say I would kill you! Are you serious?\" Audio later confirmed she did threaten the lineswoman.  The incident resulted in Williams being penalized a point for unsportsmanlike conduct — necessitated by the earlier warning for racquet abuse — meaning Clijsters won the match 6–4, 7–5. The following day, Williams was issued the maximum permissible on-site fine of $10,000 (plus $500 for racquet abuse). After further investigation, the Grand Slam Committee in November 2009 fined her $175,000 in lieu of suspending her from the 2010 US Open or other Grand Slam events.  They also placed her on a two-year probation, so if Williams committed another offense in the following two years at a Grand Slam tournament, she would be suspended from participating in the following US Open. If she committed no offenses in the next two years, her fine would be reduced to $82,500.  Williams initially refused to apologize for her outburst, both in her post-match press conference  and in an official statement released the following day.  She eventually apologized to the lineswoman in a statement two days following the incident. , In the final of the 2011 U.S. Open against Samantha Stosur , Williams again generated controversy. After shouting \"Come on!\" as the Australian attempted to return a forehand Williams believed to be a winner, chair umpire Eva Asderaki awarded the point to Stosur based on the USTA 's deliberate hindrance rule, which states, \"If a player commits any act which hinders his opponent in making a stroke, then, if this is deliberate, he shall lose the point or if involuntary, the point shall be replayed.\"  As the point was 30–40 on Williams's serve, the penalty gave the break of serve to Stosur. Williams became angry with the chair umpire and made several gestures and unflattering comments toward her during the next changeover, including telling Asderaki that if she ever saw the umpire coming toward her, she should \"look the other way\".  Williams initially gained momentum in the set following the penalty, breaking back in the next game, but eventually flagged and lost the match, 6–2, 6–3. At the end of the match, she declined to offer the customary handshake to Asderaki.   Williams mentioned the incident in her post-match speech as the tournament runner-up, claiming, \"I hit a winner, but I guess it didn't count\", but added, \"It wouldn't have mattered in the end. Sam played really well.\" [ citation needed ] A writer for ESPN suggested that Williams could avoid being found to have violated the terms of the \"probation\" on which she was placed following her 2009 outburst, as she did not appear to have used profanity in addressing Asderaki during the match.  In the end, Williams was fined $2,000 and was not barred from competing in the 2012 US Open because \"...Williams's conduct, while verbally abusive, [did] not rise to the level of a major offence under the Grand Slam code of conduct.\"  , In the early 2000s, Williams wore Puma apparel and footwear on court.  She used Wilson Hammer 6.4 Stretch Power Holes racket.  , Williams was once known for her unusual and colorful outfits on court. In 2002, there was much talk when she wore a Lane Bryant black lycra catsuit at the US Open.  At the 2004 US Open, Williams wore denim skirts and knee-high boots—tournament officials, however, did not allow her to wear the boots during matches.  At Wimbledon in 2008, the white trench coat she wore during warm-up for her opening match was the subject of much discussion since it was worn despite the sunny weather.  Off-court, Williams has also presented new designs. In November 2004, at the London premiere of After the Sunset she wore a red gown that had a near-topless effect.  , Williams formerly had a special line with Puma  and currently [ when? ] has a line with Nike . The deal with Nike is worth US$40 million and was signed in April 2004.  Since 2004, she has also been running her own line of designer apparel called \"Aneres\"—her first name spelled backward. In 2009 she launched a signature collection of handbags and jewelry.

A series of online videos and print advertisements for Tampax Pearl tampons showed her hitting balls at Mother Nature , played by Catherine Lloyd Burns , to prevent Mother Nature giving her a red-wrapped gift, representing her menstrual period . In the online videos, the two have dueling press conferences over the \"bad blood\" between them. \"A lot of celebrities are not open to working with our brand, and we're thrilled that Serena is\", said a brand manager for Tampax at Procter & Gamble .  , In July 2012, she appeared in the ABC comedic improv television series Trust Us With Your Life and as a lawyer on the Lifetime television series Drop Dead Diva . , To celebrate the 35th anniversary of Pac-Man, Williams will make a cameo appearance in the movie \" The Pixels \" which will star Adam Sandler and Kevin James.
