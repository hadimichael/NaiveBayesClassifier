A United States resident since 1994,  Sharapova has competed on the WTA tour since 2001. She has been ranked world No. 1 in singles by the WTA on five separate occasions, for a total of 21 weeks. She is one of ten women, and the lone Russian, to hold the career Grand Slam and is an Olympic medalist , having earned silver for Russia in women's singles at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London . , Sharapova became the world No. 1 for the first time on August 22, 2005 at the age of 18, and last held the ranking for the fifth time for four weeks from June 11, 2012 to July 8, 2012.

She has won at least one singles title a year from 2003 until 2015, a streak only bested by Steffi Graf , Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert . Several tennis pundits and former players have called Sharapova one of tennis’s best competitors, with John McEnroe calling her one of the best the sport has ever seen.  , Sharapova has been featured in a number of modeling assignments, including a feature in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue . She appeared in many advertisements, including those for Nike, Prince, and Canon, being the face of several fashion houses , most notably Cole Haan . Since February 2007, she has been a United Nations Development Programme Goodwill Ambassador , concerned specifically with the Chernobyl Recovery and Development Programme . In June 2011, she was named one of the \"30 Legends of Women's Tennis: Past, Present and Future\" by Time ,  and in March 2012 was named one of the \" 100 Greatest of All Time \" by Tennis Channel . , , , Maria Sharapova was born on 19 April 1987 in Nyagan , Russian SFSR . Her parents, Yuri and Yelena, are from Gomel , Belarussian SSR . Concerned about the regional effects of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident , they left their homeland shortly before Sharapova was born.  , In 1989, when Sharapova was two, the family moved to Sochi , Krasnodar Krai , Russia . There her father Yuri befriended Aleksandr Kafelnikov, whose son Yevgeny would go on to win two Grand Slam singles titles and become Russia's first world No. 1 ranked tennis player. Aleksandr gave Sharapova her first tennis racquet in 1991 when she was four, whereupon she began practicing regularly with her father at a local park.  Maria took her first tennis lessons with veteran Russian coach Yuri Yutkin, who was instantly impressed when he saw her play, noting her \"exceptional hand-eye coordination \".  , In 1993, at the age of six, Sharapova attended a tennis clinic in Moscow run by Martina Navratilova , who recommended professional training at the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy in Bradenton, Florida , which had previously trained players such as Andre Agassi , Monica Seles , and Anna Kournikova .  With money tight, Yuri Sharapov borrowed the sum that would enable him and his daughter, neither of whom could speak English, to travel to the United States of America, which they finally did in 1994.  Visa restrictions prevented Sharapova's mother from joining them for two years.  Arriving in Florida with savings of US$700,  Sharapova's father took various low-paying jobs, including dishwashing, to fund her lessons until she was old enough to be admitted to the academy. Before she entered the IMG business, she trained with Rick Macci, in the Rick Macci Tennis Academy. She then was offered a deal from IMG which forced her to change academies. Originally, she did train with Rick Macci, but after the deal with IMG, she could not see Rick Macci anymore.

Sharapova made her professional debut in 2001 on her 14th birthday on April 19, and played her first WTA tournament at the Pacific Life Open in 2002, winning a match before losing to Monica Seles .

In the final, Sharapova upset top seed and defending champion Serena Williams to win her first Grand Slam singles title, and become the third-youngest woman to win the Wimbledon title, behind only Lottie Dod and Martina Hingis .

Sharapova then defeated Venus Williams , Kirsten Flipkens , and Ekaterina Makarova , where in losing only nine games she broke Monica Seles ' record of fewest games dropped heading into a Grand Slam semifinal.  She lost to Li Na in the semifinals. , She reached the semifinals at the Qatar Total Open , losing to Serena Williams for the 10th straight time in her career.  Her next tournament was Indian Wells , where she was seeded second. She received a bye into the second round and successfully reached the final without dropping a set, where she faced 2011 Indian wells champion and former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki .

Her win also made her the No. 2 player in the world behind Serena Williams .    , Maria then competed at the Sony Open . Once again she reached the final without dropping a set and faced world No. 1 Serena Williams . Maria started the match strong, winning the first set. However, Serena won the second and dominated the third set. This was Maria's 11th consecutive loss against Serena.   , Next, she played at the indoor clay event in Stuttgart, where she was the defending champion. Maria was top seed and had a bye in the first round. Her first three matches were long three-setters: she first beat world No. 25 Lucie Šafářová , dropping the second set on a tiebreak, then Ana Ivanovic , then in the semifinals she won against third seed Angelique Kerber . In the final, in what was her ninth victory against the Chinese out of 14 matches, she beat second seed world No. 5 Li Na in straight sets to win her 29th career title.  , A week later, she competed at the Madrid Open , reaching the final, again without dropping a set. She faced Serena Williams for the 15th time, losing for the 12th consecutive time in straight sets.  , Next, she played in Rome, where she was seeded second and had a bye in the first round. She beat 16th seed Sloane Stephens in straight sets (with the loss of just three games) in the third round, but then did not play her quarterfinal match against seventh seed Sara Errani and retired from the tournament due to a viral illness.   , At the 2013 French Open , Sharapova reached the final again, beating Azarenka in three sets in the semifinals, but there she lost in straight sets to Serena Williams . At Wimbledon she was comprehensively beaten in the second round by qualifier Michelle Larcher de Brito . Sharapova then returned to the tour at the 2013 Western & Southern Open , where she lost her opening match to Sloane Stephens in three sets. A week later Sharapova withdrew from the U.S. Open citing a shoulder injury, which prematurely ended her season.  , Sharapova had not played since August 2013 due to a recurring shoulder injury and made her comeback at the 2014 Brisbane International .  Sharapova advanced to the semi-finals where she was beaten in straight sets by Serena Williams . At the 2014 Australian Open Sharapova, ranked 3rd, was knocked out of the tournament in the 4th round by the 20th seed, and eventual finalist, Dominika Cibulkova . Sharapova lost the match in 3 sets. Sharapova then participated in GDF Suez where she was upset in the semifinals to fellow Russian and eventual tournament winner Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in three sets. , In March, playing in the Indian Wells Masters , she was beaten by 22-year-old Italian Camila Giorgi in the third round, in three sets.  Therefore, due to the WTA ranking system, this would mean another drop in ranking, bringing her to world No. 7. In April, she won Stuttgart Open , her first title of the year and 30th of her career by defeating Ana Ivanovic in three sets. Stuttgart is the only tournament Sharapova has won three times. In May, Maria won the Madrid Open , her second title of the year and first in Madrid , defeating Simona Halep in three sets. With nine clay titles, she joins Venus Williams as the third most successful active player on the surface.  Sharapova then competed in the Italian Open in Rome, where she made the third round. She lost to Ana Ivanovic in straight sets. , Sharapova was seeded 7th at 2014 French Open and defeated Ksenia Pervak, Tsvetana Pironkova, and Paula Ormaechea in the first 3 rounds, all in straight sets. In the fourth round she defeated Samantha Stosur, reeling off nine straight games from a set and 3–4 down. This marked her 14th win in 16 meetings with the Australian. In the quarters, she defeated Garbine Muguruza , again coming back from a set down, to reach the semifinals at the French for the fourth consecutive year. In the semi-finals, she defeated Eugenie Bouchard , once again coming back from a set down, to reach her third consecutive French Open final. In the final, she defeated Simona Halep in three sets to win her second French Open title and fifth overall Major title. This was the first time since 2001 where a third set was contested in the final. The match took just over three hours, and has been described as one of the best women's finals in recent years.  The 2014 Wimbledon Championships will be her next tournament as Sharapova chose not to play a warm-up event before the third Grand Slam of the season gets underway.  At the 2014 Wimbledon Championships , Sharapova reached the fourth round, where she lost to German Angelique Kerber , the ninth seed, in three sets. , Sharapova then played the 2014 Rogers Cup in Montreal where she was the 4th seed. She received a first round bye and faced Garbine Muguruza in her opener, she won in 3 sets. In the following round she lost in 3 sets to Muguruza's compatriot, Carla Suarez Navarro . At the 2014 Western & Southern Open , Sharapova was seeded 5th and defeated Madison Keys after having a first round bye. She then went on to defeat Pavlyuchenkova and newly crowned world no.2 Simona Halep to reach the last four. She faced Ivanovic again but lost in a roller coaster three-setter despite having two match points. Sharapova then travelled to New York for the US Open where she was the 5th seed. She defeated compatriot Maria Kirilenko and Romanian Alexandra Dulgheru before overcoming 26th seeded German Sabine Lisicki in round 3 to set up a clash with Caroline Wozniacki in the round of 16. Sharapova lost to the Dane in 3 sets. , Sharapova next played the inaugural 2014 Wuhan open where she was seeded 4th. After receiving a first round bye she defeated compatriot Svetlana Kuznetsova in 3 sets and next faced Timea Bacsinszky . Although Sharapova won their 2 previous encounters she was stunned by Timea in 2 tight sets thus ending her campaign at the premier 5 tournament. , The following week Sharapova played the China Open in Beijing a Premier Mandatory-level tournament. Reaching the final without dropping a set, Sharapova defeated world No. 9 Ana Ivanovic in the semis. In the final Sharapova met reigning Wimbledon champion and world No. 3 Petra Kvitova. Sharapova won the match in 2 hours 30 minutes, defeating the Czech in three sets. By virtue of the win, Sharapova's ranking rose from No. 4 to No. 2 in the world and she secured herself the second seeding for the WTA year end Championship. Also, Sharapova closed in on the year end number one ranking spot, being just 467 points behind Williams. , Maria was ranked No. 2 heading into the WTA Tour Championships, with a chance of overtaking Serena Williams as world No. 1. She was drawn in the white group, with Petra Kvitova , Agnieszka Radwanska and Caroline Wozniacki . Her first match was a three set loss to Wozniacki. Maria also lost her 2nd round robin match to Kvitova in straight sets; her first loss to Petra since 2011. Maria still had a chance of making the Semis, however she needed to beat Radwanska in two sets, and Wozniacki needed to beat Petra in straight sets as well. She ended her year with a win against Radwanska in three sets, finishing 3rd overall in the White group. She ended the year as world No. 2, behind Serena Williams . , Sharapova kicked off her 2015 season at the Brisbane International where she was top seed and received a bye in the first round. Sharapova defeated Yaroslava Shvedova and Carla Suarez Navarro. In the semi finals Sharapova faced Elina Svitolina, beating her in straight sets. Reaching the final without dropping a set, Sharapova played an intense match against second seed Ana Ivanovic but came through in three sets. This was Sharapova's 10th win over Ivanovic and by winning her 34th title, it meant that Sharapova has won at least one title every year for 13 consecutive years. Also, it was just her second title in Australia so far, and for both she beat Ivanovic. Sharapova's next tournament was the 2015 Australian Open, where she beat Petra Martić and fellow countrywoman Alexandra Panova (despite having two match points against her) in the first two rounds, before beating Zarina Diyas and Peng Shuai in straight sets. There, she beat seventh-seeded Eugenie Bouchard and fellow Russian Ekaterina Makarova in straight sets to make her fourth Australian Open final, where she lost to Serena Williams in straight sets, worsening her record against her to 2–17. In February, following her participation in the Fed Cup , Sharapova played in Acapulco , where she beat Shelby Rogers , Mariana Duque Mariño and Magdaléna Rybáriková to advance the semifinals. Sharapova later withdrew from her match against Caroline Garcia , citing a stomach virus. Next, in Indian Wells , she beat Yanina Wickmayer and Victoria Azarenka in straight sets, before losing to defending champion Flavia Pennetta in the fourth round in three sets. After receiving a bye in the first round of the Miami Open , Sharapova lost in the second round to fellow Russian Daria Gavrilova in straight sets, marking her earliest exit from the tournament since her first appearance in Miami in 2003. , Sharapova began her clay season in Stuttgart where she was the three time defending champion. After receiving a first round bye, she lost in the second round to Angelique Kerber in three sets, snapping Sharapova's win streak at the tournament and marking her first ever loss at the tournament having won it three times in a row ( 2012 , 2013 , & 2014 ). The loss also snapped a 64 match win streak on clay where Sharapova won the first set and went on to win the match. The last time Sharapova lost a match on clay after winning the first set was against Dinara Safina in the fourth round at the 2008 French Open . As a result of the loss Sharapova lost the No. 2 ranking to Simona Halep . Sharapova's next clay court tournament was the Madrid Open where she was the defending champion. She advanced to the semifinals. There, she was beaten by Svetlana Kuznetsova for the first time since 2008. Sharapova's next tournament was be the Italian Open in Rome where she was seeded 3rd. She beat Victoria Azarenka in the quarterfinals in straight sets to set up a re-match with Daria Gavrilova . She beat Gavrilova in straight sets to advance to the final, where she faced Carla Suarez Navarro . After losing the first set, Sharapova managed to claim the next two sets and her third Rome title. By winning Rome, Sharapova reclaimed the No. 2 ranking over Halep. , Sharapova has lived in the United States since moving there at the age of seven, but retains her Russian citizenship, and is therefore eligible to play in the Fed Cup for Russia.  However, the behavior of Sharapova's father during her matches on the WTA Tour, combined with a perceived lack of commitment by her to the Fed Cup, has made her selection for the Russian Fed Cup team cause controversy in the past. , After Sharapova had beaten fellow Russian Anastasia Myskina at the 2004 WTA Tour Championships , Myskina criticized Sharapova's father, saying: \"He was just yelling and screaming instructions to her and I thought he just might jump right on the court at one point in the match.\" At the Fed Cup semifinals two weeks later, Myskina stated she would stop playing for Russia if Sharapova joined the Russian team the following season: \"If she joins our team next season you won't see me there for sure. His behaviour is totally incorrect, simply rude. I don't want to be around people like him.\" Larisa Neiland , assistant to Russia Fed Cup captain Shamil Tarpishchev, added: \"Her father's behaviour (at the WTA Tour Championships) was simply outrageous. I just don't see how he could work with the rest of us.\" However Tarpishchev himself played down the problem, insisting: \"I feel that things will calm down soon and we'll have Myskina, Sharapova, Kuznetsova and everyone else playing for Russia.\"  , At the end of 2005, Sharapova stated she was now keen to make her Fed Cup debut  and was set to play against Belgium in April 2006, but withdrew.  She later withdrew from ties against Spain in April 2007  and against the United States in July 2007 because of injuries.  The latter withdrawal led to Russia's captain saying she would be \"ineligible for selection\" for the Fed Cup final in September.  However, Sharapova attended the final, cheering from the sidelines and acting as a \"hitting partner\" in practices, resulting in some of her Russian teammates implying that she was attending only to enable her to play at the 2008 Beijing Olympics (rules state that players must have \"shown commitment\" to Fed Cup in order to play). Svetlana Kuznetsova said, \"She said she wanted to be our practice partner but if you can't play how then can you practice?\"  , Sharapova finally made her Fed Cup debut in February 2008, in Russia's quarterfinal tie against Israel .  She won both her singles rubbers, against Tzipora Obziler and Shahar Pe'er , helping Russia to a 4–1 victory.  For the semifinals, she was given permission to skip the tie, with Tarpishchev announcing that she will be on the team for the final.  However, the date of the final coincided with the lay-off from her shoulder injury, and thus she did not play.  , In the 2011 first-round tie, Sharapova played Virginie Razzano of France and lost. Sharapova was supposed to play Alizé Cornet but she was suffering from a viral illness.  Teammate Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova played and defeated Cornet to secure the 3–2 win for Russia against France. Sharapova continued to participate in 2012 and helped Russia to a 3–2 win against Spain in the first-round tie. Sharapova defeated Silvia Soler Espinosa in the first rubber, but was unable to play her second rubber due to illness.  In 2015, Sharapova helped Russia earn a place in the semifinals after beating Pole Urszula Radwanska in the first tie and her sister Agnieszka Radwanska in the second tie. , Sharapova is an aggressive baseliner with power, depth, and angles on her forehand and backhand.  She is one of the few players on the WTA tour who often uses the reverse forehand. Instead of using a traditional volley or overhead smash , she prefers to hit a powerful \"swinging\" volley when approaching the net or attacking lobs .  Sharapova is thought to have good speed around the court, especially considering her height.  At the beginning of 2008, some observers noted that Sharapova had developed her game, showing improved movement and footwork and the addition of a drop shot and sliced backhand to her repertoire of shots.   Despite her powerful game, Sharapova's greatest asset is considered to be her mental toughness and competitive spirit, with Nick Bollettieri stating that she is \"tough as nails\". Hall-of-famer John McEnroe said of Sharapova, \"she's one of the best competitors in the history of the sport.\"  Sharapova is known for on-court \" grunting \", which reached a recorded 101 decibels during a match at Wimbledon in 2005 .  During her second round match in Birmingham in 2003, Sharapova was asked to tone down the level of her grunt after opponent Nathalie Dechy complained to the umpire, with Sharapova's response saying that her grunting was \"a natural instinct.\"  Monica Seles suggested that grunting is involuntary and a part of tennis.  When questioned by the media about her grunting, Sharapova urged the media to \"just watch the match.\"  Her defensive game has been worked on by her new coach, and this has reflected in her results, making consecutive semi-finals at premier mandatory events on the tour. Later in her career, Sharapova also added drop shots to her repertoire, making for a more unpredictable game style. , Early in her career Sharapova's first and second serves were regarded as powerful,  and she was believed to possess one of the best deliveries on the Tour.  Since the beginning of 2007, however, problems with her shoulder have reduced the effectiveness of her serve.  The shoulder injury not only resulted in her inconsistent first serves, but also her hitting high numbers of double faults.  Two-time US Open singles champion Tracy Austin believes that Sharapova often loses confidence in the rest of her game when she experiences problems with her serve and consequently produces more unforced errors and generally plays more tentatively,  while tennis writer Joel Drucker remarked that her serve was the \"catalyst for her entire game\", and that her struggles with it left her \"unmasked.\"  , In her return from layoff in 2008 to 2009, she used an abbreviated motion, which was somewhat less powerful, and though producing aces also gave a very high number of double faults. After her early loss at the 2009 US Open , Sharapova returned to a more elongated motion, similar to her pre-surgery serve. She has since been able to produce speeds greater than before, including a 121 mph serve hit at the Birmingham tournament in 2010 – the fastest serve of her career.  , However since her shoulder operation Sharapova has been unable to control her serve. This has led to numerous faults, as she is unable to feel how much power she is generating.  The new action led to an elbow injury, but under Thomas Högstedt it has improved but can still be erratic.  This improvement in serving can be seen in the 2013 Australian Open and following tournaments where Maria Sharapova committed fewer double faults than in previous years. , Because she predicates her game on power, Sharapova's preferred surfaces early in her career were the fast-playing hard and grass courts, as evident through her 25 victories on hard court and grass court. This is most notable when she won the 2004 Wimbledon , 2006 U.S. Open and 2008 Australian Open crowns, where she had her career breakthrough and played her peak tennis level, respectively. , Sharapova initially was not as well-suited to the slower clay courts as she is on hard and grass courts. Sharapova admitted in 2007 that she was not as comfortable with her movement on clay compared with other court surfaces and once described herself as like a \"cow on ice\" after a match on clay,  due to her inability to slide. Later in her career, she showed improvement on this surface with respect to experience, as evidenced with her first WTA red clay title at the 2010 Internationaux de Strasbourg , 7 years since playing on the WTA circuit. She won her first French Open title and captured the career grand slam at the 2012 French Open and as of 2014 leads the WTA tour of active players with the highest winning percentage on clay, with an 84.25% winning rate.  Since her shoulder injury, her best surface has become clay over grass & hard courts, and with her victory at the 2014 French Open , she has now won the French Open twice, which is more times than she has won any other slam, and her last 3 Grand Slam Finals have all been at the French Open (3 consecutive finals from 2012–2014). , Sharapova has dated Maroon 5 singer Adam Levine . The couple dated for a short time in 2005 after meeting at Sharapova's 18th birthday party. However, the couple broke up soon. In 2008, Sharapova briefly dated American television producer Charlie Ebersol but the pair split soon after. In 2011, Sharapova was engaged to Slovenian professional basketball player Sasha Vujačić .   The two had been dating since 2009.  On August 31, 2012, Sharapova confirmed that the pair had ended the engagement and separated during early 2012. Later that year, she began dating Bulgarian tennis player Grigor Dimitrov . The two confirmed their relationship after the 2013 Madrid Open. , Sharapova has lived in the United States since moving there at the age of seven. Besides a home in Bradenton , Florida, she also has a residence in Manhattan Beach, California .  From 2005 to 2011, Sharapova was named to the Forbes Celebrity 100 , which attempts to compile the top 100 most powerful celebrities of that year.  Sharapova has made varying remarks on how long she intends to maintain her tennis career. Following the retirement of 25-year-old Justine Henin in 2008, Sharapova said, \"If I was 25 and I'd won so many Grand Slams, I'd quit too.\"  In an interview after the 2008 Australian Open , she balked at the idea of playing for another ten years, saying that she hoped to have a \"nice husband and a few kids\" by then.  However in an interview before her 2012 Australian Open semifinal, Sharapova changed her stance, saying she intended to continue playing tennis for as long as she enjoyed playing the game. Sharapova stated \"I'm sure when I was 17 years old and someone said, you'll be playing for another eight years, it would be like, you're not going to see me at a press conference at 25 years old. But years go on. I missed a year in my career—I didn't play that year. I've said this, just before the tournament, a few weeks before, I woke up and I was just so happy to be going back on the court. I felt so fresh, full of energy, just with a really good perspective. Times change, obviously. I see myself playing this sport for many more years because it's something that gives me the most pleasure in my life. I think it helps when you know you're good at something, and you can always improve it. It obviously helps with the encouragement.\"  , At the 2004 US Open , Sharapova, along with several other Russian female tennis players, wore a black ribbon in observance of the tragedy after the Beslan school hostage crisis , which took place only days before.  In 2005, she donated around US$50,000 to those affected by the crisis.  On February 14, 2007, Sharapova was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and donated US$210,000 to UNDP Chernobyl-recovery projects . She stated at the time that she was planning to travel back to the area after Wimbledon in 2008,  though it didn't happen, as she had to travel back to the US because of shoulder injury.  She fulfilled the trip in late June – early July 2010. Sharapova has helped to promote the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi , Russia,  and was the first torch bearer in the torch-lighting ceremony during the opening festivities. In addition, with Angela Haynes , Maria Kirilenko , Nicole Vaidišová , Rennae Stubbs , Governor Jeb Bush and Jennifer Capriati , Sharapova participated in an exhibition in Tampa in December 2004, raising money for the Florida Hurricane Relief Fund.  In July 2008, Sharapova sent a message on DVD to the memorial service of cancer victim Emily Bailes, who had performed the coin toss ahead of the 2004 Wimbledon final that Sharapova had gone on to win.  , Sharapova's tennis success and appearance have enabled her to secure commercial endorsements that greatly exceed the value of her tournament winnings.   In March 2006, Forbes magazine listed her as the highest-paid female athlete in the world, with annual earnings of over US $18 million,  the majority of which was from endorsements and sponsorships. She has topped that list every year since, even after her 2007 shoulder injury.    In 2011, Forbes listed Sharapova as No. 29 in their list of 50 top-paid athletes, the only woman on the list.  In 2012, she was listed as No. 15, and was joined in the top 20 by Li Na at No. 16 and Serena Williams at No. 17.  In April 2005, People named her one of the 50 most beautiful celebrities in the world.  In 2006, Maxim ranked Sharapova the hottest athlete in the world for the fourth consecutive year. She posed in a six-page bikini photoshoot spread in the 2006 Valentine's Day issue of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue , alongside 25 supermodels.  In a poll run by Britain's FHM magazine, she was voted the seventh most eligible bachelorette,  based on both \"wealth and looks.\" , Immediately after her win at the 2004 Wimbledon Championship, mobile phone company Motorola signed Sharapova to endorse their mobile phone line.  Additionally, she appeared in commercials for Land Rover and Canon , as well as approved of namesake items by watch brand Tag Heuer and jeweller Tiffany .  Tiffany also provides Sharapova with earrings from the \"Tiffany for Maria Sharapova\" collection at the four major events, that are also retailed globally.  She also starred in an award winning campaign for the sports clothing brand Nike, \" Pretty \", in the summer of 2006. She signed a sponsorship deal in January 2007 with Gatorade and Tropicana ,  which ended in 2009.  In 2007, Sharapova was featured in a number of Canon USA's commercials for the PowerShot.  Sharapova has also been depicted in many tennis-related video games. Some of the titles include the Top Spin series , Virtua Tennis series, and Grand Slam Tennis series. During the layoff due to her shoulder surgery, sensing the fleeting nature of a professional athlete's career, Sharapova decided to focus on developing her name as a brand, beginning with meeting with her sponsors more extensively to further her brand.  In January 2010, it was announced that Sharapova had renewed her contract with Nike, signing an 8-year deal for $70 million. This is the most lucrative deal ever for a sportswoman, dwarfing the previous record, which was Venus Williams' $43 million deal with Reebok.  , Following in the footsteps of tennis players who started clothing lines such as Fred Perry and René Lacoste , Sharapova launched her own tennis apparel line, the \"Nike Maria Sharapova Collection\", in 2010. The collection includes dresses that she designed for all the major tournaments, in collaboration with Nike and Cole Haan .  She had previously found that the outfits given to her by Nike did not suit her frame and were worn by too many other players.  She comes up with design ideas and sketches in a process that begins 18 months before the event  and receives royalties from the sale of the collection, of which the corresponding dresses are coordinated to be available simultaneously with the corresponding major tournament.  The collection is worn by other WTA players, including Sofia Arvidsson , Eugenie Bouchard , Kai-Chen Chang , Andrea Hlaváčková , Madison Keys , Anastasia Pivovarova as well as junior players such as Indy De Vroome .  Sharapova had earlier collaborated with Nike on the \"little black dress\" that she wore for her night matches at the 2006 US Open.  The dress featured a round crystal studded collar and was inspired by Audrey Hepburn .  The dress was well publicized and received but was not mass-produced.    Additionally, she designs shoes and handbags for Cole Haan, for which her signature ballerina flats are one of the biggest sellers of the entire brand.  , Sharapova used the Prince Triple Threat Hornet for part of 2003 and then used several different Prince racquets until the US Open . She gave the racquet she used in the 2004 Wimbledon final to Regis Philbin when taping Live with Regis and Kelly . Sharapova began using the Prince Shark OS at that tournament specially designed for her.  She then switched to the Prince O3 White racquet in January 2006. She switched to the Prince O3 Speedport Black in July 2008.  After being with Prince for ten years,  Sharapova began endorsing Head racquets in 2011 and uses the Head YOUTEK IG Instinct.   , Sharapova signed a three-year deal to be brand ambassador for Porsche in 2013.  , Sugarpova is a candy line created by Maria Sharapova and candy veteran Jeff Rubin, founder of international retailer IT'SUGAR.
