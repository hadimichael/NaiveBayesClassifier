All she wanted to do was race other youngsters to the end of the rink. Her coach suggested she take up speed skating, which she did, swayed by watching Eric and Beth Heiden in the world championships in her home town of Milwaukee . She was a member of the U.S. speedskating team from 1987 to 1991 and selected for the world championships in 1988-1991. , Having used cycling as training for skating, Barry switched completely, prompted by a cycling race series ( Superweek ) on streets in front of her childhood home. Other American cyclists who excelled in both sports include Eric and Beth Heiden, Chris Witty , and Erin Mirabella. , Disappointed not to qualify for the Olympics in 1996 and 2000, Barry did not race in 2001 but came back strongly next year with victory in the Montreal World Cup, in which she used a steel frame built by her father-in-law, Mike Barry. , Her biggest success came in 2004. Picked for the U.S. Olympic team after accumulating more UCI points than other riders, she came second in the individual time trial event. , Michael and Dede kept EPO in their fridge but were never caught.
