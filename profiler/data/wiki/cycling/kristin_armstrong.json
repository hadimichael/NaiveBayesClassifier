She was diagnosed with osteoarthritis in both hips in 2001 at age 27, and told that she could no longer run at an elite level, thus ending her triathlon career and leading her to focus exclusively on cycling.   , The three-time national champion finished 8th (top U.S. finisher) in the women's road race at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. , At the 2008 Summer Olympics in China, Armstrong completed the biggest achievement of her career by winning the gold medal in the women's road time trial competition on August 13.

In a written statement, she stated that her retirement was merely temporary in order to start a family. \"I love cycling and I love competing. I stopped racing after the 2009 World Championships not because I was burned out, but because my husband and I wanted to start a family,” said Kristin Armstrong. \"I told myself from the beginning if everything went smoothly with the birth of our son, Lucas William, I would consider racing again.\" Armstrong will be competing on a team she is a part owner of, Peanut Butter & Co. Team TWENTY12.  , In 2011, Armstrong did indeed return with Peanut Butter & Co. Team TWENTY12. She won three of the four stages (criterium, road race and time trial) and the overall title during the Sea Otter Classic in April.

However two days after announcing Armstrong's selection the USA Cycling Selection Committee reconvened, deciding that the new selection process under which Armstrong had been chosen had not been published in a timely manner, that as a result the federation's older Principles of Athlete Selection, which had been issued in 2008, should be used for selection to the Pan American Championships, and that Armstrong's place would be taken by Tayler Wiles .  The following month Armstrong won the United States National Time Trial Championships in Chattanooga, Tennessee , beating Carmen Small by 13 seconds.  , Armstrong grew up as a military brat as her father was an officer in the US Marines .
