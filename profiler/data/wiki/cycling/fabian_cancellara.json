At age nineteen he turned professional and signed with the Mapei-Quick Step team, where he rode as a stagiaire . He is known for being a quality time trialist ,  a classics specialist, and a workhorse for his teammates that have general classification aspirations. , After winning a few stages and small races in his starting years, Cancellara earned his first major victory at the 2004 Tour de France where he won the opening prologue time trial and wore race leader yellow jersey for one day. The following season saw fewer victories, but his 2006 season saw a victory in the men's time trial at the UCI Road World Championships , along with victory at the Paris–Roubaix .

The next season saw Cancellara again become world time trial champion and lead both the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España . In 2010, he won the Paris–Roubaix and the Tour of Flanders . Cancellara's 2011 and 2012 campaigns were both short in number of victories, while the latter was hampered by injuries throughout. After a lackluster two year period, Cancellara again won the Tour of Flanders and Paris–Roubaix double in 2013.

In addition, Cancellara excelled at cross-country skiing during his youth.  , Cancellara's cycling skills began to blossom at an early age, when he impressed as a time trialist and dominated Swiss junior cycling. Yvan Girard, Swiss national junior team coach from 1997 to 2005, was quoted saying that Cancellara was \"head and shoulders above everyone else\" in the time trials.  He won the junior World Time Trial Championship in both 1998 and 1999 and at the age of 19 he came in second at the 2000 U-23 World Time Trial Championship .  , After his second place finish at the Under-23 time trial championship, Cancellara turned professional with Mapei-Quick Step ,  which was one of the strongest teams in the world at the time.  Cancellara rode as a stagiaire for the Mapei-Quick Step team in late 2000 before joining the team for the 2001 season as a member of the \"Young Riders Project\".  Cancellara's first victory as a professional came at the prologue of the Tour of Rhodes , where he also won the overall final general classification.  , For 2002 the Mapei team split into two formations per UCI regulations, the \"Top Team\" with 25 riders and the GS-III \"Gruppo Giovani\" (youth group) to develop young talents, which Cancellara joined with other riders including Filippo Pozzato , Michael Rogers and Bernhard Eisel .  Giorgio Squinzi, the head of Mapei firm, later said in an interview with La Gazzetta dello Sport that he took Cancellara and Pozzato all the way from the Junior category to Mapei's top team, in order to let them avoid the Under-23 category where he suggested that doping was even worse than among professionals. Squinzi also said that Cancellara was going to be \"The future Miguel Indurain\".  During his two seasons with Mapei, Cancellara used his time trialling skills to great effect, winning several individual time trials and a total of eleven victories.  , Following the folding of Mapei-Quick Step at the end of the 2002 season, Cancellara joined Fassa Bortolo to work as a lead-out man for Alessandro Petacchi in 2003.

He finished sixth overall after being in the lead chase group that was in pursuit of the winner Tom Boonen and second place finisher Leif Hoste .  The next weekend, Cancellara rode his final classic of the season in the Paris–Roubaix .  Cancellara was in the leading group of riders for most of the stage.  When the race reached the Carrefour de l'Arbre, he powered away from his fellow riders and went on by himself to win the race itself.  This was his first ever classic victory.  , His next victory came in the stage one individual time trial at the Volta a Catalunya .  In late June, Cancellara won his third straight Swiss National Time Trial champion title.  He was not selected to ride with Team CSC at the Tour de France .

Cancellara continued his success in the time trial with a victory in the Swiss national time trial.  , Cancellara won the prologue of the Tour de France in London, defeating Andreas Kloden of Astana by thirteen seconds.  During stage two , he was caught up in a very large crash which brought down an estimated thirty riders.

At Paris–Roubaix , Cancellara finished second after being out-sprinted by the winner Boonen.  , In preparation for the second half of the season, Cancellara rode the Tour de Luxembourg and the Tour de Suisse . Cancellara won the prologue of the Tour de Luxembourg and briefly held the overall lead because of the victory.  After finishing the Tour de Luxembourg, he started the Tour de Suisse where he saw great success.  Cancellara won the seventh and ninth stages through attacks in the closing kilometers of each stage.   In addition to the two stage wins, he also won the points classification.  Cancellara joined his team at the Tour de France .  Cancellara proved to be a valuable asset to the squad as he helped his teammate Carlos Sastre to overall victory at the Tour.  Cancellara was later awarded the stage win in the penultimate stage after the initial winner, Stefan Schumacher , tested positive for EPO .  , In the Olympic Road Race in Beijing , Cancellara was in a chasing group with around 5 km (3.1 mi) before he attacked and successfully bridged the gap to the leading group when 1 km (0.62 mi) was left to race.

Cancellara was subsequently promoted to second place, and the initial fourth place finisher Alexandr Kolobnev was promoted to third place.  The riders did not initially receive new medals for their new placings.  On December 18, 2010, Cancellara received the same physical medal initially given to Rebellin, in a ceremony held in his hometown of Ittigen , Switzerland.  Cancellara's bronze was then given to Kolobnev.  Four days after racing the road race, Cancellara raced the time trial event .  He won the gold medal by winning the race by over thirty seconds to Swedish rider Gustav Larsson .

This was his second victory in a row in the prologue at the Tour of California.  Cancellara then returned to the Tirreno–Adriatico , but an injury prevented his efforts to repeat as winner of the event.  Cancellara did not finish the sixth stage of the race; he left the event without winning a single stage.  Poor performance marred the early portion of the season for Cancellara as he achieved no success in the early season classics; he did not finish the Tour of Flanders after suffering problem with his bike chain early in the race, on the Koppenberg , and he finished 49th overall in the Paris–Roubaix .   , Cancellara began to achieve success in June, during the Tour de Suisse . He won the opening time trial of the race and the time trial on stage nine en route to his overall victory.

He won the opening time trial and then held the lead of the race until the race's fourth stage .   Cancellara briefly regained the lead of the race after winning the time trial on stage seven , but he lost the lead after the next stage 's conclusion.   , The Road World Championships took place in Cancellara's native country Switzerland and he stated that he wished to win both events.   Cancellara dominated the time trial event and won by a margin of close a minute and a half over the second place finisher.   This was Cancellara's third world championship in the time trial discipline, which was tied for most ever with Australia's Michael Rogers .  Cancellara's next goal was the road race , which was to take place three days later.  During the final lap of the race, Cancellara crossed the gap to the race's leading group that had just formed.  At the bottom of the final climb Cadel Evans (Australia) attacked, but no other riders reacted.  Cancellara crossed the line in fifth.   , Fabian Cancellara kicked off his 2010 campaign with an overall victory at the Tour of Oman .  He gained the lead after the race's final stage and won the race without winning a single stage.  In late March, Cancellara won the E3 Prijs Vlaanderen after riding away from Boonen and Juan Antonio Flecha with about 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) remaining in the race.  On 4 April he raced the famed Tour of Flanders .  Cancellara first attacked in the race on the Molenberg with about 44 kilometres (27.3 mi) remaining in the race and only Boonen was able to mark his efforts.  Cancellara's second major attack took place on the steepest part of the Muur van Geraardsbergen .  The attack proved successful as he was able to drop Boonen and solo on to the victory.   By winning the Tour of Flanders , he became the twelfth cyclist to win the opening three monuments the of the cycling year – Milan – San Remo , Tour of Flanders, and the Paris–Roubaix  – in a career.  After winning the Tour of Flanders, Cancellara stated that he wished to win the other two cycling monuments: the Liège–Bastogne–Liège and the Giro di Lombardia .  , Just a week after his victory at the Tour of Flanders, Cancellara raced the Paris–Roubaix .  Cancellara made a move during the Mons-en-Pévèle portion of the race with more than 50 kilometres (31.1 mi) to go in the race and no one was able to match his efforts.  Cancellara then rode solo all the way to the finish in the Roubaix Velodrome and finished two minutes ahead the second place finisher Thor Hushovd .   After winning the Roubaix, Cancellara decided to skip the rest of the classics to race the Tour of California as part of his warm up for the Tour de France .  He completed the Tour of California without winning a single stage. , Cancellara's next victory came at the Tour de Suisse where he won the prologue, which was an individual time trial around the city of Lugano.  Cancellara came close to another stage win in the stage nine individual time trial, but fell short by seventeen seconds.  Next, Cancellara won the prologue of the Tour de France.  He then held the lead until the second stage came to an end, after stage winner Sylvain Chavanel took it away.  However, Cancellara regained the lead the after the next day and held it until stage seven when Chavanel again took the lead.   Later in the Tour, Cancellara won the stage nineteen individual time trial that stretched from Bordeaux to Pauillac by seventeen seconds over German rider Tony Martin .  , The Road World Championships took place in Melbourne and Cancellara returned to the event to defend his title as world champion of the time trial discipline.  He won the time trial by over a minute to the second place finisher and in doing so, he became the first four-time men's world champion of the time trial.  Four days later, he competed in the road race and finished 50th overall.   , In 2010, former cyclist Davide Cassani claimed in a YouTube video that Fabian Cancellara had used a motorized bike during his victories at the Tour of Flanders and the Paris–Roubaix that year.  In the video, Cassani showed a normal road bike on a stand and after he pressed a button, the pedals began to rotate.   Cassani then alleged that a motor could easily be stowed in the seattube of the bike and the button to turn it on would be located on the handlebars.   In the YouTube video, Cassani showed clips of Cancellara at the two races allegedly \"turning on\" the motor while riding and showing the drastic increase in speed.   The claims caught steam since rumors were already going around about riders possibly using the new motor, the Gruber Assist, which could produce 100 Watts of power to aid the rider.  , The Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) stated that whilst they are not investigating any specific teams or riders, it would review the need for a new bicycle inspection system to detect such cheating.  Then UCI stated that there was no case against Cancellara after the claims gained prominence.  Cancellara dismissed Cassani's claims saying that they were \"stupid\" and far too risky to do.   He even told the Belgian newspaper Het Nieuwsblad that he had \"never had batteries on [his] bike.\"  , This was Cancellara's first year with his new team Leopard Trek , which lacked the high caliber domestiques that Cancellara had in the past, meaning that winning would be tougher for Cancellara. His first major race of the year was the Tirreno–Adriatico , where he won the race's final stage which was an individual time trial.  Cancellara came to the Milan – San Remo with the hopes of winning the race a second time.  He positioned himself in an eight-man breakaway that made it all the way to the finish.  As the group approached the finish line, Cancellara was bested in the sprint for the line by Australian Matthew Goss and Cancellara crossed the line in second.  , Cancellara was seen as the favorite or top contender for the next three one day races – the E3 Prijs Vlaanderen – Harelbeke ,  the Tour of Flanders ,   and the Paris–Roubaix   – due to his great performance in the 2010 season and his good form in the early portion of the 2011 season. He lived up to his expectations and won the E3 Prijs Vlaanderen – Harelbeke after having several flat tires and a few bike changes, he launched a solo attack with 16 kilometres (9.9 mi) and rode by himself to the finish line for the victory.  The next weekend, Cancellara began the Tour of Flanders.  He launched an attack with about 60 kilometres (37.3 mi) left to go in the race and caught up with the leader Sylvain Chavanel ; however, Cancellara cracked after Chavanel did not help with the pacing and the two were picked up by a chasing group on the Muur van Geraardsbergen.   With 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) left in the race, Cancellara launched two attacks.  His first attack was marked by the whole group, while his second attack could only be matched by Chavanel and Nick Nuyens .   The three rode into the finish together, with Nuyens taking the win, Chavanel second, and Cancellara third.   The Paris–Roubaix was next on the calendar for Cancellara.  Cancellara finished in second place after a crash hurt him early on, as did being a member of a chasing group that did not work with him to catch the leading riders.  , On the first of June, Cancellara began the Tour de Luxembourg .  He won the prologue and was the first to wear the race leader's yellow jersey.  He then held the lead until the second stage came to a close when stage winner Linus Gerdemann took the lead away from him.  Cancellara then raced the Tour de Suisse and won the opening and closing stages of the race, which were both individual time trials.   He then closed out June by winning the Swiss National Road Race after he out-sprinted Steve Morabito for the win, which was his second Swiss National Road Race title.  , Cancellara entered the Tour de France in July, but was unable to come away with a victory in either the team time trial or the lone individual time trial .   Up next for Cancellara was the Vuelta a España , where he helped his team achieve victory in the stage one 's team time trial.  Cancellara's final events for the 2011 season were the road race and the time trial at the Road World Championships . Cancellara came to the with the hopes of winning a third consecutive time trial world crown; however, he would finish in third place after the winner Martin and runner-up Wiggins.   Four days later, Cancellara lined up to race the road race.  The race came down to a sprint finish that was won by Mark Cavendish ; Cancellara barely missed a medal after finishing in fourth place.   , In the first races of the 2012 season, Cancellara showed a good form: he powered to a second victory on the gravel roads of the Strade Bianche and took a victory in the closing time trial of the Tirreno–Adriatico . In the final of the first monument of the year, Milan – San Remo , he was the strongest rider during the descent of the Poggio , but was outsprinted for victory by Simon Gerrans . He was in great form for the Belgian spring classics, but a fall and material malfunction kept him from playing a part in the final of both the E3 Harelbeke and Gent–Wevelgem . Cancellara was one of the favourites to win the renewed Tour of Flanders but played no part in the final due to a crash in the feed zone. It was caused by a discarded water bottle. He suffered a four-part fracture of the right collarbone which ruined his spring campaign.   , He came back to competition on 10 June in his homeland, racing in the Tour de Suisse . Cancellara stated that he was nervous before the start of the prologue, which he finished in second position, four seconds behind the winner, Liquigas-Cannondale 's Peter Sagan .  , In the Tour de France , Cancellara won the opening-day prologue in Liège ; his fifth such victory in the Tour.  After his fifth day in the yellow jersey in the race, Cancellara broke René Vietto 's longstanding record as the rider with the most career yellow jerseys who has not won the Tour overall.  He subsequently lost the jersey to Wiggins of Team Sky after conceding almost two minutes on the seventh stage , which finished on top of a steep Category 1 climb leading to Planche des Belles Filles.  He withdrew from the Tour after the eleventh stage to return home to support his wife before the birth of their second child.   , Cancellara returned to compete in the road race at the Olympics Games . He was the leading rider of a massive breakaway when he badly negotiated a right turn with about 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) to cover and fell heavily on his right shoulder. He completed the race, finishing approximately five minutes after the winner, the Kazakh Alexandre Vinokourov , but was in obvious pain and could not hold his handlebar properly with his right hand. As he crossed the line, he was in tears and was sent to the hospital where it was revealed that he did not suffer any fractures.   Two days after the incident, it was announced that he would be able to defend his Olympic Time Trial title, an event he subsequently finished in seventh.  In August, Cancellara announced that he was putting an end to his 2012 season. He required further surgery on his collarbone to get the stabilizing vises out of his body.   , Cancellara began the 2013 campaign with the Tour of Qatar and the Tour of Oman , but failed to collect any victories.   After finishing the aforementioned tours, he raced the Strade Bianche and finished in fourth place.  Next, Cancellara raced the Tirreno–Adriatico .  He came close to a stage victory in the race's stage seven individual time trial , but missed the win by twelve seconds.  Just five days later, Cancellara lined up at the Milan – San Remo ,  where he was considered by many as a favorite to win the race.   The race was marred by poor weather conditions, but Cancellara remained near the front and managed to place third overall after losing out in the sprint for the finish line.  , His first win of the year came in E3 Harelbeke , after an attack on the Oude Kwaremont, with 35 km (22 mi) remaining of the race.  His victory at the E3 Harelbeke solidified him as a contender for the upcoming Tour of Flanders .  On the last lap of the Tour of Flanders, Cancellara attacked on the Oude Kwaremont and only Peter Sagan was able to match Cancellara's move.  Together, the two rode all the way to the front of the race.  Cancellara then attacked on the Paterberg hill with about 13 km (8 mi) remaining in the race.  Cancellara's attack was successful and he rode solo into the finish and won his second Tour of Flanders.   , After the Tour of Flanders, Cancellara then rode the Scheldeprijs in Belgium.  During the race, he fell after about 50 km (31 mi) of racing but still finished the race.  The next day, Cancellara crashed while riding on the Waindignies-Hamage cobbled sector of the Paris-Roubaix .  Despite the crashes, many still considered Fabian Cancellara a favorite to win the Paris-Roubaix.   During the Paris-Roubaix on April 7, Cancellara was attacked multiple times by his competitors, but he managed to counter all their attacks.  With about 16 km (10 mi) to go, Cancellara made a move that only Sep Vanmarcke and Zdeněk Štybar could follow.   Štybar was dropped after he collided with a spectator, leaving Cancellara and Vanmarcke to ride to the finish.   When the two finally made their way to the velodrome where the finish was located, Cancellara managed to out-sprint Sep Vanmarcke to win his third Paris-Roubaix.   After the race, Cancellara stated that he would not ride either the Giro d'Italia or the Tour de France , but instead ride the Vuelta a España in order to prepare for UCI Road World Championships .   , On June 7, 2013 it was announced that Cancellara would ride the Tour of Austria .

He came close to a stage win when finished second on the stage seven 's 37 km (23.0 mi) time trial, 56 seconds behind stage winner Bradley Wiggins .
