Speaking on ITV's Cycle Show in July 2013, Dowsett cited this medical condition as being a key factor in his choosing competitive cycling in his youth, above other sports, because contact games such as football and rugby were considered too risky. He is believed to be the only able-bodied elite sportsman or woman with the condition.  As a result he has a special exemption from the Union Cycliste Internationale 's no needles policy, introduced in 2011,  to inject himself with the clotting protein Factor VIII every 48 hours. Dowsett runs the charitable foundation Little Bleeders to raise awareness of haemophilia.  "
