He was best known for winning the mountains classification in the Tour de France, and the World Championship Time Trial.  , He was, for the greater part of his career, a member of the Kelme team, but in 2003 joined T-Mobile Team (then named Team Telekom ). His performances as part of the Kelme dissipated in Team Telekom, with the team management blaming his lack of discipline in training, but he claimed health problems. In October 2004 he joined Phonak , together with Miguel Ángel Martín Perdiguero from Saunier Duval , and Víctor Hugo Peña and Floyd Landis from Discovery Channel-Berry Floor . He currently lives in both Colombia and Madrid , Spain with his wife. Botero joined the American domestic team, Rock Racing, for the 2008 season.
