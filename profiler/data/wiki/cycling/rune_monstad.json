He carries a tent with him, but he has hardly had to use it, as many people have offered him a place to stay in their homes. A few motels, lodges and hostels also offered him free accommodations as well as meals. Rune operates mostly on donations as cycling every day doesn't allow for time to work a regular job. He occasionally takes a few days off to see the local sights, attend special events and to meet with people in bicycle shops and cafes. , CANADA TRIP (NOVEMBER 2006 - MAY 2007) , On February 3, 2007, while he was in Regina , Saskatchewan , he was invited to give a talk about winter cycling to a group of about 60 people with Regina EcoLiving Inc., a non-profit organization located in Regina.
