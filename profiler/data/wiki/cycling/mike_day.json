With the exception of quadrennial leap years , that is the number of days in a calendar year. As a result, a play on his surname \"365 Day\" occurs from the common phrase \"...365 days a year\" (alternatively \"..365 days per year\"): , \"When you turn pro, they always give you a number in the 300s,\" he said, \"and with my name on the back, it said: 365 Day. Everyone talked about it, and I said, ‘That's it. That's going to be my number.' I'll pretty much wear it till I'm done racing.\"  , On June 14, 2008 Mike Day won a place on the USA BMX Olympic Team by winning the Team Trial at the Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista, California .
