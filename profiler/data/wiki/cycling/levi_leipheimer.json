There are moments that pull at the heart strings like when he gives the race flowers to a friend who is recovering from cancer. If you aren’t a fan, or have been put off from the recent drug confessions then “The Levi Effect” won’t change your opinion. There’s no gory details or tearful apology. However, I hope it gives you a bit of insight into the man and you see a complete picture rather than just this troubling portion of his life.  , All results from June 1, 1999 to July 30, 2006 and July 7 to July 29, 2007 are stripped.  , WD = Withdrew; In Progress = IP; Voided results = struck through "
