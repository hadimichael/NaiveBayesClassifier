  "article": "Sebastian Vettel ( German pronunciation: [zeˈbastjan ˈfɛtəl] ; born 3 July 1987  ) is a German Formula One racing driver, currently driving for Scuderia Ferrari . He is contracted to remain in that role until at least the end of 2017.  He is a four-time Formula One World Champion, having won the championship in 2010 , 2011 , 2012 , and 2013 with Red Bull Racing .  He is among the most successful F1 drivers of all time.     , In his first year driving for Red Bull in 2009 , Vettel finished the season as the youngest-ever World Drivers' Championship runner-up. The following year he went on to become the youngest driver ever to win the World Drivers' Championship, aged 23. In the same year he helped Red Bull win the team's first World Constructors' Championship . He followed up his first championship with three more titles, becoming the youngest double, triple and quadruple world champion in Formula One.  Vettel left Red Bull Racing and ended his long-term association with the company after the 2014 season and signed a contract with Ferrari for 2015 , after activating a clause to terminate his Red Bull contract early.  , Vettel has held numerous other \"youngest\" Formula One records, among them: the youngest driver to have taken part in an official practice session of a Grand Prix (until Max Verstappen at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix ), to score championship points (until Daniil Kvyat at the 2014 Australian Grand Prix ), to lead a race, to secure pole position  and to win a race .  He is also currently third in the overall tally of pole positions behind fellow German Michael Schumacher and Ayrton Senna and in fourth place among race winners .  , , , Vettel was born in Heppenheim , then West Germany,  to Norbert and Heike Vettel. He has one younger brother, Fabian, and two older sisters: Melanie, a dental technician, and Stefanie, a physiotherapist for disabled children.  Vettel suggested in an interview that he was terrible at school, but earned his Abitur at the Starkenburg Gymnasium high school in Heppenheim  with a respectable grade.  He has said that his childhood heroes were \"The three Michaels\" – Michael Schumacher , Michael Jordan , and Michael Jackson and mentioned that he wanted to be a singer like Michael Jackson, but realised that he could not as he did not have the voice.  Vettel is also a fan of The Beatles , collecting several records, including Abbey Road and his favourite song being \" Drive My Car \". In an interview on Top Gear , Vettel stated that he was a fan of British comedy such as Little Britain and Monty Python's Life of Brian . Vettel lives in Thurgovia , Switzerland amongst other racing drivers and is a fan of German football team Eintracht Frankfurt .  Vettel has described himself as competitive, private, and impatient. Vettel also appears in advertisements for Head & Shoulders . Vettel provided the voice of character Sebastian Schnell in the version of the movie Cars 2 dubbed for German-speaking audiences. Vettel is in a relationship with Hanna Prater, a British-German childhood friend.  In January 2014, Vettel became a father for the first time with the birth of his daughter Emily.   , On the Formula One circuit, Kimi Räikkönen , his Ferrari teammate for 2015, is a close friend.     , Vettel started amateur karting at the young age of 3½ and began racing in karts series in 1995, at the age of eight. Having shown early talent, he was accepted into the Red Bull Junior Team at age 11 in 1998,  and kept on winning various titles, such as the Junior Monaco Kart Cup in 2001. In 2003, he was promoted to open-wheel cars and won the 2004 German Formula BMW Championship with 18 victories from 20 races. Having impressed in his first season of auto racing in 2003, Vettel was given a chance by Derrick Walker to test a Reynard Motorsport Champ Car in a two-day private test at the Homestead road course .   , In 2005 he drove for ASL Mucke Motorsport in the Formula 3 Euro Series . He was placed fifth in the final standings with 63 points, winning the year's top rookie honours. He tested the Williams FW27 Formula One automobile on 27 September as a reward for this Formula BMW success. He then went on to test for the BMW Sauber team. , 2006 became a busy year for the 18-year-old racing driver. He drove his second season in the F3 Euroseries, had two guest appearances in the Renault World Series and was promoted to test driver for Sauber in Formula One. A schedule that resulted in a competitive season with several victories, but ultimately no championships.  , Vettel finished as runner-up in the 2006 F3 Euroseries, behind series leader and team mate Paul di Resta . He also made his debut in the Formula Renault 3.5 Series at Misano , winning after Pastor Maldonado was disqualified.  At the next round at Spa-Francorchamps , however, his finger was almost sliced off by flying débris in an accident, and he was expected to be out of racing for several weeks.  Nevertheless, he managed to compete in the Ultimate Masters of F3 at Zandvoort the following weekend, finishing in sixth place. He also set the third-fastest lap time, and it surprised his ASM team boss Frédéric Vasseur. Vasseur said: \"I was impressed for sure, because at the beginning of the week I was sure he wouldn't race! But he showed good pace from the first practice session. I can't imagine he's 100 per cent but at least we know we can be competitive in the next F3 Euroseries round at the Nürburgring next weekend – that's important.\"  , Vettel competed in the Formula Renault 3.5 Series in 2007 , and took his first win at the Nürburgring . He was leading the championship when he was called up to Formula One permanently. His seat was taken by Michael Ammermüller .  , Vettel became BMW Sauber third driver at the 2006 Turkish Grand Prix , when former incumbent Robert Kubica was called up to replace Jacques Villeneuve for the 2006 Hungarian Grand Prix . , On his testing debut, Vettel set the fastest time in the second Friday Free Practice before the race.  In his second testing session in the 2006 Italian Grand Prix , he set the fastest time in both Friday practice sessions, a race weekend in which all the BMW cars were quick, with his predecessor Robert Kubica finishing on the podium in the race. , Vettel was confirmed as BMW's test driver for 2007.  Following the serious crash of regular BMW driver Kubica at the Canadian Grand Prix , Vettel substituted for him at the United States Grand Prix .  He started in seventh position on the grid, finishing in eighth position to take his first World Championship point and became the youngest driver ever to score a point in Formula One (at the age of 19 years and 349 days), a record previously held by Jenson Button  – who was 20 years and 67 days old when he finished sixth at the 2000 Brazilian Grand Prix .  , On 31 July 2007, BMW released Vettel to join Red Bull 's Scuderia Toro Rosso team, replacing Scott Speed as one of its drivers from the Hungarian Grand Prix onwards.  He earned approximately US$165,000 for finishing the season with Toro Rosso.  Before the race, it was also announced that Vettel would drive for Toro Rosso in 2008 ,  alongside Sébastien Bourdais .  , Vettel struggled for his first couple of races while cutting his teeth with his new team, but managed two impressive drives in his 5th and 6th drives for Toro Rosso, a team that was averaging a little worse than 14th place in the 2007 season before Vettel's arrival. In the rain-hit Japanese Grand Prix at Fuji, Vettel worked his way up to third, behind Lewis Hamilton and Red Bull Racing's Mark Webber , and seemed to be on course for not only his but also Toro Rosso's maiden podium finish. However, Vettel crashed into Webber under safety car conditions taking them both out of the race and prompting Webber to say to ITV reporter Louise Goodman \"It's kids isn't it... kids with not enough experience – you do a good job and then they fuck it all up.\" Webber also specifically criticized Lewis Hamilton 's erratic behaviour in contributing to the accident, describing his antics behind the safety car as \"shit\".   Vettel was initially punished with a ten-place grid penalty for the following race, but this was lifted after a spectator video on YouTube showed the incident may have been caused by Hamilton's behaviour behind the safety car .  Vettel bounced back to finish a career-best fourth a week later at the Chinese Grand Prix having started 17th on the grid while in mixed conditions. He collected five championship points, making it both his and Toro Rosso's best race result.  , Red Bull owner Dietrich Mateschitz stated his belief Vettel would be one of Formula One's big stars in the future. \"Vettel is one of the young guys with extraordinary potential [...] He is fast, he is intelligent, and he is very interested in the technical side.\"  , After four races of the 2008 season, Vettel was the only driver to have failed to finish a single race, having retired on the first lap in three of them. In each of these three instances, he was involved in accidents caused by other drivers, the other being an engine failure. However, at the fifth round at the Turkish Grand Prix , he finally saw the chequered flag, albeit finishing in 17th after qualifying 14th and suffering a puncture on the opening lap. In the next race at the Monaco Grand Prix , Vettel scored his first points of the season with a fifth-place finish, after qualifying 17th. He scored again at the Canadian Grand Prix fighting off Heikki Kovalainen in the last few laps for the final championship point, having started from pit lane. Vettel finished 12th in France , before retiring on lap one at the wet British Grand Prix after being clipped by David Coulthard and aquaplaned into the gravel trap along with Coulthard. He earned another point at the German Grand Prix , fending off Fernando Alonso and securing eighth after Jarno Trulli ran wide. Vettel retired in Hungary after his engine overheated during his first pit stop. He impressed many at the European Grand Prix by setting the fastest times in the first practice session and second qualifying session, before qualifying sixth on the grid. Vettel finished the race in sixth, two seconds behind Jarno Trulli. Toro Rosso's technical director Giorgio Ascanelli explained said that something changed at the European Grand Prix in Valencia: \"Suddenly Vettel understood something about how to drive an F1 car quickly. It made a huge difference – not only to the speed he could unlock, but also to his ability to do so consistently.\"  , At the 2008 Italian Grand Prix , Vettel became the youngest driver in history to win a Formula One Grand Prix.  Aged 21 years and 74 days, Vettel broke the record set by Fernando Alonso at the 2003 Hungarian Grand Prix by 317 days when he won in wet conditions at Monza .  Vettel led for the majority of the Grand Prix and crossed the finish line 12.5 seconds ahead of McLaren's Heikki Kovalainen. It was the first podium and win for his Toro Rosso team.  Earlier in the weekend, he had already become the youngest polesitter , after setting the fastest times in both Q2 and Q3 qualifying stages,  and his win also gave him the record of youngest podium finisher. Toro Rosso team boss Gerhard Berger said, \"As he proved today, he can win races, but he's going to win world championships. He's a cool guy\".  Hamilton praised the German, stating that this victory showed \"how good he is\".  The nature of the victory and the story of the 21-year-old's fledgling career led the German media to dub him \"baby Schumi \", although Vettel was quick to downplay the expectation the result had brought, particularly the comparison with the seven-time World Champion: \"To compare me with Michael Schumacher is just a bit ridiculous... It will be difficult in normal conditions for us to repeat this achievement\".  He then went on to finish fifth in Singapore . In Japan , he finished sixth after being promoted from seventh after teammate Bourdais was penalised for contact with Felipe Massa . , In the Brazilian Grand Prix , after running as high as second in the race on a 3-stop strategy, Vettel overtook Lewis Hamilton in the rain for fifth place on the penultimate lap to contribute to a thrilling climax to the season. He nearly deprived the McLaren driver of the championship before Timo Glock slowed dramatically on the last lap (he was struggling with dry tyres in the ever increasing rain) enabling both Vettel and Hamilton to pass him, earning Hamilton the title, and Vettel fourth place. , After the season had finished Vettel was named Rookie of the Year at the Autosport Awards .  , At the start of the 2009 season, Vettel replaced the retired David Coulthard at Red Bull Racing , and began strongly at the Australian Grand Prix , qualifying third and running in second for the majority of the race. However, a clash with Robert Kubica over second place on the third to last lap of the race forced both to retire. Vettel attempted to finish the race on three wheels behind the safety car to salvage some points, but eventually pulled off to the side. He thought that he would be able to attempt this because the yellow flag resulting from his incident forbids overtaking; instead he was given a ten-place grid penalty for the next race, the Malaysian Grand Prix , and his team was fined for instructing him to stay on track after the damage occurred.  In Malaysia he qualified in third position, but was demoted down to 13th due to his ten-place grid drop. He spun out of the race while eighth, just before the race was stopped due to adverse weather conditions.  However, in China he went on to take pole position, the first for the Red Bull Racing team. He went on to win the race ahead of teammate Mark Webber , again a first for his team, which scored its first victory and one-two finish in the same race.  At the age of 21 years and 287 days, Vettel became the youngest Grand Prix driver in history to win for two different teams, having won the 2008 Italian Grand Prix for the Toro Rosso team. , In the Bahrain Grand Prix , Vettel qualified in third, and finished second behind Jenson Button in the race. In Spain , he qualified in second but finished the race in fourth, behind his teammate Mark Webber who finished in third. Vettel won the British Grand Prix after claiming pole position in qualifying.  At the German Grand Prix he qualified fourth and finished second, behind Webber, who won his first Grand Prix.  At the Hungarian Grand Prix , Vettel qualified second after an eventful qualifying, but had to retire from the race on lap 30 after his car sustained damage from contact with Kimi Räikkönen 's car on the first lap.  , At the European Grand Prix , he qualified fourth but had to retire from the race with an engine failure. It was the second engine failure for Vettel during the weekend, and the RB5's reliability issues began to show.  He finished third at Spa-Francorchamps , and struggled for pace at Monza, finishing 8th at a race he previously won. He qualified 2nd at Singapore, but was given a drive-though penalty for speeding in the pit lane and damaged the diffuser on a kerb, struggling to 4th. He subsequently won the Japanese Grand Prix from pole position, leading every lap and only being denied of the fastest lap by 0.002 seconds by teammate Mark Webber, who did so on the final lap.  He would have to wait until the 2011 Indian Grand Prix until he finally achieved a Grand Slam . , At the Brazilian Grand Prix , Vettel qualified 16th in a rain-hit session, behind title rival Jenson Button (14th) and Rubens Barrichello (1st), while his teammate Webber qualified second with Adrian Sutil in third. Vettel needed to score at least second place in the race to keep his title hopes alive. He finished fourth with Button behind, giving Button the Championship and moving Vettel up into second place. He officially claimed second place by winning the inaugural Abu Dhabi Grand Prix , again ahead of Webber with Button completing the podium. He also scored his third fastest lap of the year, drawing him level with teammate Webber. However, as Vettel had more second fastest laps, he won the 2009 DHL Fastest Lap Award .  , On 21 August 2009 it was announced that Red Bull and Vettel had extended his contract until the end of the 2011 season  with an option for 2012 . The option was later taken up on 14 March 2011, as Vettel extended his contract with the team until the end of 2014.  , Vettel continued with Red Bull for 2010, and took the first pole position of the season at the Bahrain Grand Prix . Vettel went on to lead most of the race but a spark-plug failure meant that his lap times slowed down, and as a result the two Ferraris and the McLaren of Lewis Hamilton passed him. After a brief challenge from Rosberg he brought the car home in fourth. , At the Australian Grand Prix , Vettel was appointed as a director of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association .  He took his second consecutive pole position in Australia, ahead of teammate Mark Webber , but spun off when leading the race, due to a loose wheel nut. In Malaysia , he took his first win of the 2010 season with Webber coming in second place, having passed both him and Nico Rosberg at turn one.  , Vettel qualified on pole at China alongside Webber. At the start of the wet race Fernando Alonso jump-started  and Vettel was passed by Webber, dropping back to third. The increasing rain forced Vettel and Webber to pit at the same time for intermediate tyres that wore out after only a few laps and dropped them back into the midfield. Vettel slowly climbed back up to finish sixth, ahead of Webber. In Spain , Vettel was outqualified by teammate Webber and claimed second on the grid. Despite having a major brake problem during the last eight laps, Vettel managed third place after Hamilton crashed on the penultimate lap. , In Monaco Vettel was again outqualified by Webber. In the race he passed Kubica at the start and stayed there for the remainder of the Grand Prix and made it a Red Bull 1–2. After the race, the two Red Bull drivers were equal on points in the Drivers' Championship, with Webber being a championship leader based on total wins. At the Turkish Grand Prix he qualified third and was running second behind Webber when he made a passing move on the Australian. The two collided, putting Vettel out of the race and dropping him to fifth in the Drivers' Championship, with neither driver accepting responsibility for causing the collision. He finished fourth at the Canadian Grand Prix , maintaining his position in the standings. He started the European Grand Prix in pole position and led from start to finish to score his second win of the season. , At Silverstone , both Vettel and Webber's cars were fitted with a new design of front wing. Vettel's front wing was damaged in the third practice session, and Webber's sole surviving example was removed and given to Vettel.  Vettel qualified in pole position ahead of his teammate, but suffered a puncture caused by driving wide off the track on the first lap of the race and fell to the tail of the field. He fought back to finish seventh while Webber took the victory. At the German Grand Prix he took pole by 0.002 seconds, and finished in third position in the race, behind the Ferraris of Alonso and Felipe Massa , after a poor start. He also finished third in Hungary after serving a drive-through penalty for exceeding ten lengths behind the previous car, teammate Webber, under neutralised safety car conditions. In Belgium , he had a tough race, hitting Button's car whilst attempting to pass, causing Button to retire. Vettel pitted and carried on, but then suffered a puncture whilst passing Liuzzi at the same place, completing a whole lap with a puncture. He eventually finished 15th, his lowest placing of the season (other than his retirements in Australia and Turkey). At Monza he finished fourth after an engine problem scare, and at the Singapore Grand Prix , Vettel qualified and finished second, sticking on Alonso's tail for most of the race. He passed Button for fourth place in the championship. At the Japanese Grand Prix , he dominated all practice sessions bar one, as it was postponed after heavy rain. He qualified on pole ahead of team mate Webber and went on to win with a lights-to-flag victory. Aged 23 years and 98 days, Vettel became the youngest Grand Prix driver to win at the same track on two occasions, having also won the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka in 2009. At the first Korean Grand Prix , Vettel took pole and led the first 45 laps of the race before retiring with engine failure, handing victory to Alonso. , At the Brazilian Grand Prix , Vettel qualified second but took the lead at the first corner and led for the entire race to victory. With Webber taking second place, and Alonso finishing third, Vettel went into the final race of the season with a 15-point deficit to Alonso, and a 7-point gap to Webber. With the one-two finish in Brazil, Vettel and Webber secured Red Bull Racing's first Formula One World Constructors' Championship. He won the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix from pole again, to take the Drivers' Championship lead for the first time in his career and became the youngest world champion in the sport's history.    Following John Surtees in the 1964 season and James Hunt in 1976 , this was also only the third time in Formula One history when the World Champion had not been championship leader at any earlier point in the season. , After the postponement of the Bahrain Grand Prix , Vettel started his title defence in style in the Australian Grand Prix with pole position and a victory of 22 seconds over title rival Lewis Hamilton , who was nursing home his broken McLaren. Vettel continued his title defence in the Malaysian Grand Prix , where he pipped Hamilton for pole position by a tenth of a second, and went on to win the race from Jenson Button. Vettel completed his third pole position of the season at the Chinese Grand Prix , and appeared to be in dominating form for the majority of the race. However, poor tyre management haunted him in the last several laps, possibly being related to his inability to properly communicate with his team, as his radio was broken. He finished the race second, his championship lead cut to 21 points (by Hamilton) after three races.  , The Turkish Grand Prix started out poorly for Vettel, where he had very little practice time during the Friday free practice sessions, including a crash in the first session. Even with the limited practice, he claimed his fifth consecutive pole position and converted it into a win, extending his championship lead over Hamilton to 34 points. At the Spanish Grand Prix , his pole position streak ended as his KERS failed him during qualifying. His teammate Webber took pole, but Vettel went on to win the race by 0.6 seconds over Hamilton, with Hamilton chasing him down at the end on prime tyres, and Vettel having to deal with a frequently malfunctioning KERS.  The following weekend, in the Monaco Grand Prix , he took pole with the second fastest qualifying time in Monaco's history. Vettel was leading the race with a 5-second gap over second-placed Button. Due to a radio malfunction, the Red Bull pit crew was not prepared for Vettel when he pitted. The net result was that the pitstop was slow, and that he was sent out on the wrong tyres, handing the lead to Button as well. Vettel switched to a one-stop strategy, and stuck with one set of soft tyres for 56 laps. He was caught by Alonso and Button as his tyres deteriorated, but neither were able to pass him. With a few laps remaining, the race was red-flagged after Vitaly Petrov required an ambulance after an accident. The suspended race allowed teams to change tyres and work on the cars, and when the race was restarted under the safety car, Vettel was able to retain the lead during the last few laps.  , In Canada , he took his sixth pole position in seven races ahead of Fernando Alonso and Felipe Massa . Vettel kept his lead from the start of the race, and for the vast majority of the race he held on to it. The record six safety car periods due to the down-pouring rain and 2-hour race suspension profoundly hurt Vettel's chances of victory, however, as after every safety car restart, Vettel would lose the gap he had previously built up on the other drivers. With much fresher tyres, Button caught Vettel and began to pressure him in the last lap. Vettel slid on a damp part of the track at Turn 6, and Button used the opportunity to slip past him to take the victory. Vettel finished second, yet still extended his championship lead to 60 points ahead of Button. , At the European Grand Prix , the FIA began enforcing a controversial ban on engine mappings. It was believed by many in the press that this was an attempt by the FIA to thwart Vettel's domination of the season.  The changes appeared to do little to hinder Vettel, as he took pole with the fastest qualifying lap in the track's history. He dominated the race with his first triple of 2011 with pole, fastest lap, and won his sixth race out of eight races. It was the first time in Formula One history where, in the first eight races, 1) a driver finished first in six or more races and 2) finished second or better in all 8 races. , The second set of controversial mid-season changes were implemented at Silverstone , targeting the blown diffusers . Red Bull believed the changes cost them about half a second per lap.  Webber just edged Vettel for pole position by 0.032 seconds in qualifying. On race day, Vettel made a better start, immediately took the lead and led the first half of the race. A delay at one of his pit stops allowed Alonso to pass him in the pit lane and dropped Vettel back to third, behind Hamilton. Despite a malfunctioning KERS unit, he was able to jump Hamilton in the stops and held off the faster Webber, who ignored a radio message from team principal Christian Horner to hold position, for second place, extending his lead in the championship.  , Vettel's run of fourteen successive front-row starts and eleven successive top two finishes ended at his home race , where he qualified third and finished fourth. McLaren 's mechanical grip outclassed Red Bull in the wet in Hungary , and despite leading into the first corner from pole, he was quickly passed by both Hamilton and Button. Vettel eventually finished second in the race, held in mixed conditions. In Belgium , Vettel qualified on pole and won the race, his seventh victory of the season and seventeenth of his career. In victory, Vettel extended his lead in the championship to 92 points and, even with seven races left, his tally of 259 points surpassed his own record (from 2010 ) for the highest number of championship points accumulated in a season. At the Italian Grand Prix at Monza , he took his tenth pole position of the year – joining Ayrton Senna as the only drivers to have taken ten pole positions in two separate seasons – and the 25th of his career,  and eventually won the race after passing Alonso, who had overtaken Vettel at the start. Vettel led every lap from pole position in Singapore , despite a safety car period eliminating a 22-second lead that he had held. His ninth win of the season left only Jenson Button in championship contention, who was 124 points behind with five races remaining. , Vettel arrived in Japan needing only a single championship point, tenth place, to secure his second championship. In qualifying, Vettel recorded his twelfth pole position of the season – his fifth in succession – edging Button by 0.009 seconds. In the race, Vettel held the lead until the second pit-stop phase, when Button used the undercut to get past.  He remained second after a safety car restart, but because his tyres wore out not long after that, he slipped down to third behind Alonso. He tried to fight Alonso for the position, but after several unsuccessful passing attempts, his race engineer told him to hold position and defend his championship. This podium finish secured his second successive title with four races remaining, making him the youngest ever double world champion and also the youngest back-to-back champion, joining only eight other drivers who had won consecutive titles.  In Korea , Vettel started second, but won the race – becoming the second driver to take at least ten wins in a season after Michael Schumacher   – after overtaking Lewis Hamilton on the first lap, building a healthy gap for the rest of the race, and recording the fastest lap of the race on the final lap. He helped secure Red Bull's second successive Constructors' World Championship in the process.   Vettel took his eleventh victory of the season in the inaugural Indian Grand Prix , leading every lap from pole position, as well as setting the race's fastest lap on the final lap, despite Red Bull having detuned his engine in an effort not to risk the race victory.   , At the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix , Vettel took his fourteenth pole position of 2011 to equal the record of poles in a season set by Nigel Mansell in 1992 .  Vettel had a good start to maintain the lead by the first corner, but at the second corner, a right rear puncture saw him go sliding off the track. He returned to the pits, but suspension damage forced his first retirement since the 2010 Korean Grand Prix . Vettel then broke the record for the most poles in a season at the next round, the season finale in Brazil .  He maintained his lead into the first corner but was slowed by gearbox trouble early in the race. He allowed teammate Webber to pass him as his problem worsened, but eventually finished second ahead of Button to complete a 1–2 sweep for the team upon Webber's only victory of the year. Vettel completed the year with 15 poles, 11 victories, and 17 podiums from 19 races; he also earned a record total of 392 points in the process. , Vettel remained at Red Bull for the 2012 season,  and was again partnered by Mark Webber. He scored a second-place finish at the opening race of the season in Australia .  Vettel started fifth in Malaysia , promoted from sixth after Kimi Räikkönen suffered a five-place grid penalty. Vettel spent the majority of the rain-affected race in fourth place, but picked a puncture from a collision with the HRT of Narain Karthikeyan on lap 47. He dropped to twelfth after pitting to replace the tyre, and finished eleventh after Pastor Maldonado retired late in the race with an engine failure. This was Vettel's first finish outside the points since the 2010 Belgian Grand Prix ; Karthikeyan was given a 20-second post-race penalty for his part in the collision, which dropped Karthikeyan from 21st to 22nd and last. , After the race, Vettel and Red Bull boss Christian Horner criticised Karthikeyan's driving, with Vettel calling Karthikeyan an \"idiot\",  and a \"cucumber\".  Karthikeyan hit back at Vettel, calling him a \"cry-baby\".  Later, Karthikeyan decided to call a truce with Vettel, stating his respect for Vettel's abilities and saying \"I think we have to deal with it in a mature way and forget about it.\"  Vettel qualified eleventh for the Chinese Grand Prix ; the first time he had qualified outside the top ten since the 2009 Brazilian Grand Prix ,  although he ran as high as 2nd with 7 laps remaining until tyre wear on a 2-stop strategy took its toll and he dropped to 5th by the flag. , Vettel qualified in pole position for the first time in 2012 at the Bahrain Grand Prix . Vettel was able to lead for most of the race, despite coming under pressure from Kimi Räikkönen , and crossed the line in first place to take his first victory of the season; the result also saw Vettel go top of the drivers' standings for the first time in 2012. At the Spanish GP , he maintained his championship lead, albeit only on countback, after a 6th-place finish having started 7th following on from a qualifying session in which he didn't set a time in Q3. Vettel received a drive-through penalty for failing to slow for yellow flags during the race as well as having to change his front wing as a result of debris from an incident involving Michael Schumacher and Bruno Senna. After an eventful race at Monaco , he placed fourth, gaining 5 places from his ninth-place grid position. , Vettel claimed his 2nd pole position for the season in Canada , however he dropped to 3rd after the first pitstops and then trying to go the remaining distance of the same tyres, he fell back in the closing stages and had to make a late stop for new tyres. He eventually came 4th. At the following race in Valencia , he claimed his 33rd pole position, going 3rd equal with Jim Clark and Alain Prost in the all-time list. However joy turned to despair in the race as a 20-second lead in the first 20 laps was reduced to nothing by a safety car appearance. On the first lap of the restart, his car ground to a halt, with an alternator failure being the cause. Vettel would have taken the lead in the standings- instead, he fell back to 4th behind Alonso (who won), Hamilton and Webber. , At Silverstone , Vettel qualified 4th after a wet session which, at one point, had to be suspended for over 1 hour due to torrential rain. In the dry race he overcame a slow start, where he dropped to 5th, to finish 3rd behind Webber and Alonso. In Germany he started second, but before the third pit-stop, he was attacked by Hamilton, who wanted to unlap himself, lost some time, and was overtaken by Button after the pit-stop. On the penultimate lap he passed Button and finished second behind Alonso. After the race, however, the stewards found that Vettel was off the track when he overtook Button and so they awarded him a 20-second time penalty which dropped him back to fifth. At the following race in Hungary, Vettel finished 4th after starting 3rd. Then, at the Belgian Grand Prix , he fought back from a poor qualifying, where he was knocked out in Q2 to start 10th, and a poor start in which he had to avoid the big accident ahead of him. Having ended the first lap in 12th, he managed to finish 2nd. At Round 13 in Italy , Vettel started 5th and was running 4th until he forced Fernando Alonso onto the grass, for which he received a drive-through penalty, dropping him to 9th. Then, having recovered to 6th with 5 laps to go, the alternator on his car failed for the second time in the weekend. Vettel was classified 22nd, with championship leader Alonso coming 3rd and Hamilton winning. , After the summer break, the next race was the Singapore Grand Prix , where Vettel qualified 3rd. He overtook Pastor Maldonado at the start, before the leader Lewis Hamilton retired with a car failure. Vettel then kept the lead until the 2-hour race limit was reached. It was his first win in 10 races, ending his worst run since his maiden win (which came in his 22nd race). At Suzuka for the Japanese Grand Prix , Vettel took his 2nd career Grand Slam (Pole, Fastest Lap and lead every lap) and coupled with Alonso retiring on the first lap, he cut the gap down to just 4 points. On 14 October he won his third consecutive race at the Korean Grand Prix. He overtook his team mate Mark Webber, who took the pole, to finish the race ahead of him, making it a Red Bull one-two finish. South Korean \" Gangnam Style \" rapper PSY waved the chequered flag as Vettel crossed the finish line.  With this win, Vettel took the lead in the overall championship from Ferrari's Fernando Alonso . The Indian Grand Prix brought another victory, with Vettel topping all 3 practice sessions before taking pole position and leading every lap of the race to a comfortable win, ahead of teammate Mark Webber in 3rd – who lost his 2nd place when a KERS failure slowed him down.  , Abu Dhabi presented one of Vettel's most controversial qualifying sessions of the season when, after setting the third fastest time in Q3, he was told to stop the car. A fuel pump issue was later found to be the source of this problem and the ensuing penalty  meant Vettel was to start the race from last, but as Red Bull then decided to make changes to the car, he was forced to start from the pit lane. However, in the race, Vettel managed to fight his way back to 3rd place to complete the podium. After a podium in the US Grand Prix Vettel was well set up to win the championship in Brazil . Vettel started the race with a 13-point cushion against title contender Fernando Alonso . After a close eventful race full of spins, which included Vettel's opening lap incident with Bruno Senna , crashes and changing weather conditions, Vettel finished 6th while Alonso finished 2nd, resulting in Vettel winning the championship by three points.  This was Vettel's third consecutive championship, and at age 25 he became the youngest ever triple world champion,  beating Ayrton Senna 's previous record. Senna won his third F1 world championship title in 1991 at age 31.  Vettel also became the third driver to acquire three-consecutive championships, after Juan Manuel Fangio and Michael Schumacher .  , Vettel started his fifth season with Red Bull Racing by qualifying on pole for the 2013 Australian Grand Prix ,  before going on to finish the race in third place, twenty-two seconds behind race winner Kimi Räikkönen .  He took pole again for the Malaysian Grand Prix in dominant display of wet weather driving, lapping over 2.5 seconds faster than teammate Webber.  He went on to win the race, though not without controversy, after Vettel ignored team orders not to pass teammate Mark Webber . Webber emerged from the pits a fraction of a second ahead of Vettel as they went side-by-side into the first corner. Although Red Bull told both drivers that they were to finish with Webber to take the win, after two laps Vettel eventually overtook Webber for the lead with eleven laps remaining in the race. Webber was furious after the race.  Team principal Christian Horner , although unhappy with Vettel's actions, pointed out that Webber had defied team orders on several previous occasions, as recently as two races ago . Horner acknowledged that the already fragile relationship between the two drivers had further broken down as a result of the incident.  Vettel apologised for his actions, claiming that he had not deliberately ignored the order despite the team's insistence that he had been made perfectly aware of the instruction to maintain his position.  Vettel later recanted his apology, claiming that he was not sorry for winning and that if the situation presented itself again, he would have passed Webber in spite of the order, adding that he felt Webber did not deserve to win the race.  , In the Chinese Grand Prix , Vettel qualified 9th, after not setting a time in Q3, before finishing 4th, setting fastest lap and crossing the line two-tenths behind 3rd placed Lewis Hamilton . Vettel won from second on the grid in Bahrain , passing Nico Rosberg in the opening laps. Vettel maintained the championship lead with 4th in Spain , and 2nd at the Monaco Grand Prix . He won in dominant fashion at Montreal , winning from pole position by 15 seconds and lapping everyone up to 5th, extending his lead to 36 points. , His lead was cut at the British Grand Prix as he was denied a likely win due to gearbox failure, but he bounced back to win his home race in Germany for the first time, despite pressure from Kimi Räikkönen and Romain Grosjean. In Hungary , Vettel had to settle for 3rd behind Hamilton and Räikkönen, but wins in Belgium (from 2nd on the grid), Italy , Singapore and Korea (all 3 from pole) put him 77 points clear with only 5 races to go. With grand slams at Singapore & Korea, he became only the 3rd man after Alberto Ascari and Jim Clark to take consecutive grand slams. Vettel sealed his fourth world title at the 2013 Indian Grand Prix on 27 October.   , \"It's very difficult for me personally, to receive boos, even though you haven't done anything wrong.\" , On several occasions during the season, spectators booed Vettel. Although the booing was widely condemned by fellow drivers, the media and others in the paddock,   Vettel revealed that it had a negative impact on him.  , Prior to the 2011 Japanese Grand Prix , Red Bull's advisor Helmut Marko expressed his wish to extend Vettel's contract for another two years to 2016.  However, on 11 June 2013, Vettel agreed to a one-year contract extension with Red Bull until the end of the 2015 season.  , For the 2014 season and beyond, drivers picked a unique car number that they will use for the remainder of their Formula One career, Vettel chose the number five. However, as reigning World Drivers' Champion he carried number one throughout 2014.  After having Mark Webber as a team-mate for five years, Vettel's new team-mate in 2014 was Australian Daniel Ricciardo , who was promoted from the Toro Rosso team. , After struggling with reliability issues throughout winter testing, the season did not start much better for Vettel. At the Australian Grand Prix , software issues meant Vettel qualified in twelfth position  and forced him to retire from the race after just three laps.  Reliability problems also forced Vettel to retire at the Monaco and Austrian Grands Prix. Vettel qualified on the front-row for the races in Malaysia , Great Britain , and Hungary , and finished on the podium in Malaysia, Canada , Singapore and Japan . On 4 October 2014, Red Bull Racing announced that Vettel would be leaving the team at the end of the 2014 season, one year before his contract was due to expire.  After the Russian Grand Prix , he had been outqualified by a teammate over a season for the first time in his Formula One career. In addition to suffering reliability problems, throughout 2014 Vettel struggled to get to grips with the Red Bull RB10 ,  and Pirelli's 2014 tyres.  Vettel signed off the 2014 season, by becoming the first defending champion to fail to win a race in the following season, since Jacques Villeneuve in 1998 .  , The next stage of my Formula 1 career will be spent with Scuderia Ferrari and for me that means the dream of a lifetime has come true. When I was a kid, Michael Schumacher in the red car was my greatest idol and now it's an incredible honour to finally get the chance to drive a Ferrari. I already got a small taste of what the Ferrari spirit means, when I took my first win at Monza in 2008, with an engine from the Prancing Horse built in Maranello. The Scuderia has a great tradition in this sport and I am extremely motivated to help the team get back to the top. I will put my heart and soul into making it happen. , Vettel mentioned he would like to drive for Ferrari at some point in his career and was rumoured to have a non-binding pre-contract, with options, to join them in 2014.  Red Bull believed he would stay with the team for as long as they supplied a competitive car.  , On the day Vettel and Red Bull announced parting ways, team principal Christian Horner announced that Vettel was going to sign with Ferrari .  From there it took from early October to 20 November for Ferrari to announce a three-year contract with Vettel.  At the same time, Ferrari announced that Vettel's long time championship rival Fernando Alonso would be departing the team at the end of the season; meaning Vettel would partner Kimi Räikkönen at the team.  , Vettel was denied an early release from his Red Bull contract to test the 2014 Ferrari car in Abu Dhabi post-race.  Vettel instead made his first appearance at the Ferrari factory over the weekend of 29–30 November, completing nearly 100 laps around the test track of Fiorano in the 2012 car as well as performing simulator work and completing his first official interview as a Ferrari driver.  According to Ferrari's official website, Vettel did however try the simulated 2014 car in the team's simulator program. , Vettel made his Ferrari début by finishing third in the Australian Grand Prix after overtaking Felipe Massa for the position during the pit stop window.  The previous day he had narrowly outqualified team mate Kimi Räikkönen for fourth on the grid. Vettel followed that up with winning the Malaysian Grand Prix ,  his first race win for over a year and the first win for Ferrari for almost two years. It was also his 40th Grand Prix win, putting him one win behind Ayrton Senna , the 3rd-placed driver on the all-time list. After the win, an emotional Vettel paid tribute to Michael Schumacher, saying that his hero's achievements with Ferrari made the first win all the more special.  Vettel also stated his goal was to try to win the championship. Mercedes' executive director Toto Wolff admitted at the same time that Vettel was a title contender, saying that Ferrari's recovery over the winter was 'incredible'.  Vettel ran both Mercedes cars close for the first half of the race in China , but eventually had to settle for third – his third successive podium – which was a result that both Vettel and the team admitted was always the most likely on that particular occasion.  , Vettel was involved in a minor tangle with Sergio Pérez during practice for the Bahrain Grand Prix , damaging his front wing coming out of the pits. Vettel claimed the impact happened because of a brake issue that failed to slow the car down saying 'something broke on the front right' on the team radio.  In spite of his claims, the incident was investigated by the race stewards. Both Vettel and Pérez were cleared of any wrongdoing later that evening, and so escaped any penalties.  The rest of the weekend was mixed for Vettel, who qualified on the front row, but had several issues and off-track escapades during the race before being stuck behind Valtteri Bottas ' Williams and having to settle for fifth.  Given that he had qualified on the front row and that team mate Räikkönen was second, the result was somewhat underwhelming, and he dropped to third place in the championship as a result. Vettel commented that he lost his rhythm during the race and did not have enough confidence in the rear end of the car, but nevertheless remained positive about the performance potential of the car.  Before his front wing damage, Vettel had twice overtaken Nico Rosberg for second place during pitstops, only to immediately be pegged back. Vettel was in second for a long spell during the Spanish Grand Prix but due to a change of pit stop strategy, Lewis Hamilton got past and pulled away, leaving Vettel in third at the end of the race.  He finished second in Monaco . , During the course of his Formula One career, season-by-season Vettel has beaten nearly all his team-mates in the drivers' championship. The exception was in 2014 when Daniel Ricciardo beat him by 71 points. Over the course of his career, Vettel has outscored his team mates by 37.45%* (1738* vs 1264.5*). , * Season in progress. , Vettel competed in the 2007 Race of Champions at Wembley Stadium , representing the German team alongside Michael Schumacher .  Vettel and Schumacher won the Nations' Cup Title, after exciting finals. Vettel had to beat two RoC champions, Heikki Kovalainen and Marcus Grönholm , after Schumacher stalled his car. Vettel lost the individual competition however, in first heat, in his second battle against Kovalainen. , Vettel also competed in the 2008 Race of Champions , alongside Michael Schumacher. Once again they won the Nations' Cup Title after a close final against Scandinavia . In the Drivers' Cup, Vettel beat Troy Bayliss in Round One, but lost to Sébastien Loeb in the quarter-finals. Again Vettel teamed up with Michael Schumacher for the 2009 RoC Nations Cup, which they went on to win in a run-off against the Great Britain team of Jenson Button and Andy Priaulx. In the 2010 edition , on home ground in Düsseldorf , Vettel again teamed up with Schumacher to win the fourth consecutive Nations Cup.  In the Drivers' Cup, Vettel was eliminated in the semi-finals by Filipe Albuquerque , who went on to win the event. , In 2011 , Vettel and Schumacher completed their fifth consecutive Nations Cup win, beating the Nordic team of Tom Kristensen and Juho Hänninen 2–0 in the final. In the semi-finals, Vettel had to beat both Andy Priaulx and Jenson Button , after Schumacher lost to Button. The year after , Vettel and Schumacher won their sixth Nations Cup title by defeating the French team of Romain Grosjean and Sébastien Ogier 2–0 in the final. , Vettel's passion for different helmet designs started at a young age, and from his early days in karting, he has worked with helmet designer Jens Munser. At age eight, Vettel wanted the crab from The Little Mermaid , who was also called Sebastian, on his helmet.  Vettel's original helmet, in Formula One, like most Red Bull-backed drivers, was heavily influenced by the energy drink company logo. New to Vettel's helmet since the start of 2008 has been the incorporation of the red cross shape of the Kreis Bergstraße coat of arms on the front, just underneath the visor, in honour of the region of his birthplace, Heppenheim. , After switching to Red Bull in 2009, Vettel started regularly using a variety of new helmet designs. Some designs were small changes to his original Red Bull design, while others are completely original designs, such as the one he used at the 2010 Japanese Grand Prix: Vettel had a special white-red helmet design, with black kanji and hiragana for \"gives you wings\". Several of his helmet designs also featured his team members.  At the 2012 Italian Grand Prix , Vettel celebrated his 50th helmet design with a 'rusty' matte look and 50 tallies, indicating his 50 helmet designs in Formula One.  At the end of the 2013 Formula One season , Sebastian Vettel has used 76 different helmets throughout his career. \"I have a quirk\" he admits.  , Vettel started his 2013 campaign with a new design in honour of Felix Baumgartner , for his world record Red Bull Stratos space jump in October 2012.  , Helmet manufacturer Arai have stated Vettel 'retires' a helmet design after each win, although he does not need to win in order to sport a new design.  , After moving to the Ferrari team, prior to the start of the 2015 season Vettel said that he will no longer change helmet designs so often and after choosing a new design, having had a Red Bull design since he was 12, will try to stick to one design for the year, which was also enforced by a FIA rule banning 'significant' helmet changes in-season.  His new helmet design is white with the German national flag running from front to back from the middle to the viewer's left hand side and his permanent Formula One start number 5 on the top.  The helmet itself is said to be a replica of the helmet Michael Schumacher ran in his karting days. , Inspired by American bomber pilots in World War II , Vettel has made it a tradition to name his cars. Vettel invites his team members to dinner when they arrive for the first race of the season and shares what the new car will be named.  \"It’s important to have a close relationship with a car. Like a ship, a car should be named after a girl as it’s sexy.\" The car he drove for his first full season in 2008 , the Toro Rosso STR3 , was named Julie,  followed by Kate and Kate's Dirty Sister ( 2009 ), Luscious Liz and Randy Mandy ( 2010 ), Kinky Kylie ( 2011 ),  Abbey ( 2012 ),  and Hungry Heidi ( 2013 ).  Vettel's car for 2014 , the Red Bull RB10 , was baptized \"Suzie\".  Vettel has continued this tradition in his first year with Ferrari and christened his SF15-T Eva.  , Vettel's unexpected win at the 2008 Italian Grand Prix led the media to dub him the \"Baby Schumi\", \"New Schumacher\". He was not just dubbed this for his nationality, but also because of his driving style, his concentration and the hands-on role he plays behind the scenes with his team of engineers. Vettel played down the comparison stating he wanted to be the \"New Vettel\".  , Nevertheless, the similarities are marked. Like Schumacher, Vettel grew up in a small town with an everyday background—Schumacher's father a bricklayer and Vettel's a carpenter. Both had their first taste of racing at the Kerpen karting track near Cologne, not far from the Nürburgring. Vettel began driving in his garden lapping the garden many times, not even stopping to eat or shower, before he could legally take to the roads, and said his passion for cars was nurtured by watching Schumacher compete.  , After winning his first championship in 2010 , and being hailed as the 'Next Schumacher', Vettel has stated he did not want to aim for Schumacher's record after learning how hard it was to get one championship under his belt, though he would like to win more.  Each driver began to dominate the sport in the season after winning the championship. They both clinched their second successive titles before the seasons were finished (unlike their previous year), and in only their fourth full seasons. Both drivers became the youngest ever double world champions at the time, by doing this. , In 2011, Pirelli 's Paul Hembery was impressed when Vettel was the only driver to take the time to visit the factory and talk to the tyre manufacturer to gain a better insight and improve their racing. The \"only other driver that asks us a lot of questions\" is Michael Schumacher. Hembery \"found that interesting. It is like seeing the master and the protégé at work.\"  , After Schumacher was severely injured in a skiing accident in late 2013, Vettel was on hand to collect a German Millennium-Bambi award for his life achievements, on his behalf, along with Schumacher's long-term manager Sabine Kehm a year later.   Vettel also made an emotional speech commemorating Schumacher's achievements in the sport. The two of them had got to know each other well from racing together in Formula One and in the Race of Champions and are to date the only German Formula One title winners. , In 2014, Vettel cited Schumacher as one of his inspirations in becoming a Ferrari driver from 2015 saying; \"When I was a kid, Michael Schumacher in the red car was my greatest idol and now it's an incredible honour to finally get the chance to drive a Ferrari.\"  In his second race with Ferrari, Vettel became a race winner for the team. This was interestingly enough at the age of 27, exactly the same age as Schumacher winning his first race with the team. , Red Bull Racing sponsor Infiniti released a Sebastian Vettel edition of the Infiniti FX SUV for 2012. It features increased engine power, revised bodywork and lower suspension than the standard model.  , Vettel was named Rookie of the year at the annual Autosport Awards in 2008. In 2009, Vettel was awarded the Lorenzo Bandini Trophy , for achievements in the 2008 season. In the year 2010, he was voted German Sportspersonality of the Year (Sportler des Jahres). In the same year, he won the International Racing Driver category at the Autosport Awards for the first time, and has since won this award for three successive years (2010–2013). In January 2012, Vettel was honoured with the illustrious Grands Prix de l'Academie des Sports 2011 for being the \"Double consecutive F1 World Champion at the age of twenty four — winner of eleven Grands Prix out of nineteen\", and in the following month, he was further honoured with the highest sports award in Germany, the Silberne Lorbeerblatt  – Silver Laurel Leaf – in recognition of his multiple world titles and his exemplary character.  He was also voted F1 driver of the year in 2009,  2011  and 2013  by the F1 team principals for the annual secret poll, initiated by Autosport magazine, while being voted runner-up in 2010 and 2012. He additionally won the DHL Fastest Lap Award in 2009, 2012 and 2013. He became European Sportsperson of the Year by Pap in consecutive years  (2012  and 2013  ) and also by UEPS in 2010.  In 2014, he was named Sportsman of the year at the Laureus World Sports Award held in Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia .  , * Season in progress. , ( key ) (Races in bold indicate pole position, races in italics indicate fastest lap) , ( key ) (Races in bold indicate pole position, races in italics indicate fastest lap) , ( key ) (Races in bold indicate pole position; Races in italics indicate fastest lap) , Vettel holds the following Formula One records : "
