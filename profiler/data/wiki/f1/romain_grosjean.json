(Due to the Asia and Main GP2 series being combined, it is likely that this will remain true for the foreseeable future). , In 2012, Grosjean returned to Formula One with the Lotus F1 Team , alongside Kimi Räikkönen .  He took his first podium in Formula One at the 2012 Bahrain Grand Prix and took his first fastest lap in the 2012 Spanish Grand Prix .

After a good start Grosjean was up to second and then passed Kobayashi for the lead. But Grosjean made a mistake on a late rolling restart and Kobayashi tried to pass him again for the lead. Grosjean moved across on Kobayashi to keep the position but the stewards decided his defensive move was illegal and gave him a drive-through penalty dropping him to 13th at the end of the race.  Victory in the sprint race at Istanbul, the fourth round of the season, moved Grosjean into second place in the championship.  Despite dropping back from this position, he finished the season fourth and achieved the distinction of being the highest-placed rookie in the championship. , 2008 Formula 3 Euro Series season champion Nico Hülkenberg joined Pastor Maldonado at ART for 2009, forcing Grosjean out of the team. Nonetheless, Renault placed him at 2008 team champions Campos Grand Prix for 2009, now known as Barwa Addax .

He was hopeful of making progress in the race, but the brake problems reappeared, forcing him to retire after just three laps. At the Japanese Grand Prix , Grosjean qualified 18th, which he blamed on rain throughout practice preventing him from fully learning the demanding Suzuka Circuit , which he had never driven on before. He was promoted to 17th due to Timo Glock being unable to start the race. He was unable to make progress in the race, finishing 16th after struggling with understeer throughout the race on the unfamiliar circuit. At the Brazilian Grand Prix , Grosjean suffered an accident in practice, although he escaped unhurt. He qualified 13th in his repaired car, gained positions at the start, but then slipped back down to 13th after complaining of grip and tyre temperature problems, his best result of the season. At the season ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix , Grosjean qualified 19th, and finished 18th and last, again complaining of brake problems during the race.

He went on to win three more races to take the title at Monza 16 points ahead of second place man Edoardo Piscopo . , On 20 July 2010, Grosjean announced that he would return to GP2 with the DAMS team. He replaced the then Renault test driver Jérôme d'Ambrosio for the German round of the championship.  He later substituted for D'Ambrosio's injured team-mate, Ho-Pin Tung , from the Belgian round onwards (despite Tung recovering and returning to the series with a different team), finishing 3rd in Belgium and Abu Dhabi to take fourteenth place in the drivers' standings, only two positions behind D'Ambrosio.  , Grosjean returned to GP2 full-time with DAMS for the 2011 GP2 Series and 2011 GP2 Asia Series seasons.  He took two pole positions and one race victory to win the Asia Series by six points from Jules Bianchi , and also won the first race of the main series to lead that championship as well. He lost the championship lead to Giedo van der Garde , after the second round of the series, after an event which was hampered by a disqualification due to a technical infringement,  but regained it again the following week at Monaco , scoring points in both races despite starting from last place on the grid. After scoring four further wins as part of a mid-season run that included six consecutive podium finishes, he pulled clear of his pursuers and clinched the championship at the penultimate round at Spa-Francorchamps . , At the start of 2011 , Grosjean returned to the newly branded Lotus Renault GP team as one of five test drivers along with Bruno Senna , Ho-Pin Tung , Jan Charouz and Fairuz Fauzy . Lotus Renault had planned to run Robert Kubica and Vitaly Petrov throughout 2011 but Kubica had a horrific rally accident and was unable to drive during 2011.

At the British Grand Prix , Grosjean topped the timesheets during Practice 1 on Friday, but qualifying did not go as well. Right at the end of Q2 he spun into the gravel at the final corner after managing to get into Q3, this meant he could not take any further part in qualifying and started from tenth, although he was promoted to ninth after Nico Hülkenberg took a grid penalty. At the start of the race he was involved in an incident with Paul di Resta as the Force India driver clipped Grosjean's front wing meaning he had to pit for a new one. However Grosjean fought back through the field to finish in sixth just behind his team mate. At the German Grand Prix , Grosjean started nineteenth due to a gearbox penalty and finished eighteenth after picking up a puncture on lap one. A week later, at the Hungarian Grand Prix , Grosjean qualified second, the first time a French Formula One driver had started on the front row of the grid since Jean Alesi at the 1999 French Grand Prix ; Grosjean finished third in the race behind Hamilton and teammate Räikkönen. , At Spa Grosjean caused a multicar pile-up at the start of the race, with Lewis Hamilton , Fernando Alonso and Sergio Pérez all eliminated from the race as well as Grosjean; the incident was started when Grosjean drove into Hamilton on the approach to the La Source corner.  Grosjean was given a one race ban post-race (the first driver to be banned since Michael Schumacher in 1994 ),  as well as a fine of €50,000, with the FIA saying in a statement \"The stewards regard this incident as an extremely serious breach of the regulations, which had the potential to cause injury to others. It eliminated leading championship contenders from the race. The stewards note [that] the team conceded the action was an extremely serious mistake and an error of judgement. Neither the team nor the driver made any submission in mitigation of penalty.\"  He was replaced for the 2012 Italian Grand Prix by Lotus test and reserve driver Jérôme d'Ambrosio .  His team boss, Éric Boullier said that Grosjean learned an important lesson following his ban,  however just one Grand Prix later Grosjean crashed into Mark Webber at the first corner with the Australian branding him a \"first lap nutcase\". Grosjean's actions have been condemned by many drivers in the paddock.  At Abu Dhabi Grosjean was involved in another first lap incident.  In São Paulo Grosjean hit the back of Pedro de la Rosa 's HRT in qualifying.  , On December 14–16 Grosjean won the Race of Champions after a Grand Final victory over Le Mans legend Tom Kristensen at the Rajamangala Stadium in Bangkok .

[ citation needed ] He qualified 13th but his race ended when he crashed into the back of Daniel Ricciardo , earning him a 10-place grid penalty for the next race. At the Canadian Grand Prix he started last on the grid as a consequence of the 10-place grid penalty earned previously. He came back to 8th position in race but finished the race in 13th position as he had to pit stop a third time due to heavy tyre wear. On the first lap of the British Grand Prix Grosjean, squeezed between two cars crashed into Webber, damaging the front wing of Webber's car. Grosjean later retired on the last lap as he was in 8th position due to serious front wing damage. At the German Grand Prix after qualifying 5th he led the race for a while and seemed to be on a faster pace than Sebastian Vettel but the intervention of the safety car changed the race. He was forced to let his team mate Kimi Räikkönen pass towards the end of the race as Räikkönen had faster tyres. Grosjean resisted Fernando Alonso to earn his second podium of the season as Vettel went on to win the race and Räikkönen came second. At the Hungarian Grand Prix Grosjean qualified 3rd on the grid, finishing the race in 6th position after receiving a drive through penalty for crossing the white line as he overtook Felipe Massa . After the race, he was given a further 20-second time penalty for colliding with Jenson Button , however this did not affect his final position as the car behind him was more than 20 seconds behind. At the Belgian Grand Prix Grosjean qualified 7th on the grid. After a safe but difficult start Lotus choose to operate a one stop strategy on Grosjean's car. Later in the race he was sent off track by Sergio Pérez while the latter was attempting an overtake. Pérez received a drive through penalty for the incident. Grosjean finished the race in 8th position after being overtaken by Felipe Massa towards the end of the race. , At the Italian Grand Prix Grosjean qualified 13th as both Lotuses showed slow pace in practice.

At the Singapore Grand Prix Grosjean had a difficult weekend full of mechanical problems; and despite qualifying 3rd, he was forced to retire due to an engine issue while being in good position for a podium. At the Korean Grand Prix he qualified 4th and was moved up to third on the grid after Mark Webber received a 10 place grid penalty in Singapore. He took a good start in which he overtook Hamilton and he seemed to be nearly matching Vettel's pace. However the safety car coming in helped Kimi Räikkönen move back up in third and after a small mistake, Grosjean was overtaken by his team mate who finished 2nd behind Vettel while Grosjean secured his third podium of the season in 3rd position. The next weekend, at the Japanese Grand Prix in Suzuka, he qualified 4th. After a poor start by the Red Bulls on the front row, Grosjean took the lead into the first corner and showed good pace compared to the Red Bulls behind him, leading almost half the race. Sebastian Vettel passed him using DRS on the start-finish straight on lap 28, demoting Grosjean to 2nd; he was later overtaken by Vettel's teammate, Mark Webber , and finished 3rd for his second straight podium (and 2nd straight 3rd place finish). , In India , Grosjean failed to reach Q2 on medium tyres in order to save softer tyres; a bad strategic decision as he qualified 17th but had much higher potential. The next day he had a longer first stint with soft tyres in order to apply a one pit stop strategy that worked perfectly as he finished 3rd behind Vettel and Rosberg after overtaking Massa and then Räikkönen who forced him off the track on his first overtaking attempt. As Vettel clinched a 4th Drivers' World Championship in a row, Grosjean went to earn his 5th podium of the season. At Abu Dhabi , after qualifying 7th (and being promoted to 6th due to teammate Räikkönen's penalty), he had another strong start and strong race, finishing 4th – his first time outside of the podium in 4 races. At the United States Grand Prix , Grosjean had a good qualifying session and earned a 3rd spot on the grid behind the two Red Bull drivers, Vettel and Webber. On race day Grosjean had once again a strong start by overtaking Webber and nearly Vettel. By pitting last he even led one lap. He finished 2nd by holding off Webber behind him right until the end despite numerous overtaking attempts using the DRS by the Australian as Vettel went to win his record 8th victory in a row. , On 29 November 2013, it was confirmed that Grosjean would continue with Lotus in 2014.  , A new rule for the 2014 season allowed the drivers to pick a car number to use for their entire career. Grosjean was awarded his first choice of number 8. He explained his choice of number on his Facebook page: \"Simply I like this number, plus it has some signification to me. My wife was born on 8 December, we started dating in 2008 and besides, to my eyes my son is the 8th wonder of the world. That's why I picked up number 8.\"   At the Hungarian Grand Prix Grosjean spun and crashed his car whilst following the safety car.  , ( key ) , ( key ) (Races in bold indicate pole position; races in italics indicate fastest lap) , ( key ) (Races in bold indicate pole position; races in italics indicate fastest lap) , ( key ) , ( key ) (Races in bold indicate pole position; races in italics indicate fastest lap) , Grosjean married his long-term partner, Marion Jollès (who works for French TV channel TF1 as a motorsport reporter), at Chamonix on 27 June 2012.
