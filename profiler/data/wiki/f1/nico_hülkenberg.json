In 2015 he also contested in two rounds of the 2015 World Endurance Championship for Porsche, winning the 2015 24 Hours of Le Mans in his first attempt. He was the 2009 champion of the GP2 Series , and is a previous champion of both the Formula 3 Euro Series and A1 Grand Prix , as part of A1 Team Germany . He is one of three drivers since 2005 to win the GP2 series championship in his debut season, the others being Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg . , Hülkenberg raced in Formula One in 2010 with the Williams team. Despite winning the first pole position for Williams in more than five years he was not retained for 2011 , and joined Force India as a test and reserve driver. He was promoted to a race seat with the team for the 2012 season, joining Paul di Resta .   In 2013 he drove for the Sauber team,  with Mexican driver Esteban Gutiérrez as his team-mate.  Hülkenberg returned to Force India for the 2014 season.  , , , Born in Emmerich am Rhein , North Rhine-Westphalia, West Germany , Hülkenberg made his karting debut in 1997, at the age of 10. In 2002 he was German Junior Karting Champion and the following year he won the German Kart Championship.  , Hülkenberg was previously managed by Willi Weber , the long-time manager of Michael Schumacher . Weber predicted that Hülkenberg would be ready for Formula One by 2008 . He also praised Hülkenberg as an \"unbelievable talent\" and said he reminded him of Schumacher as a young driver. He also stated that he nicknamed him \" The Hulk \", after the fictional superhero, in reference to Hülkenberg changing his personality whilst at the wheel.  , Hülkenberg made his German Formula BMW in 2005, dominating the championship and winning the title comfortably. He finished first in the Formula BMW world final but was stripped of the win after it was claimed he had brake-tested his rivals during a safety car period.  , Hülkenberg also joined the German A1 Grand Prix team for the 2006–07 season . Nine wins in his rookie season made him the most successful driver in A1GP history. It meant he almost single-handedly won Germany the championship with 128 points, 35 more than Team New Zealand .  , Hülkenberg finished fifth in the German Formula Three Championship (ATS Formel 3 Cup) in 2006. For 2007 he switched to the Formula 3 Euro Series with the ASM team that had taken Lewis Hamilton and Paul di Resta to the last two championships. His first win came at the Norisring  from 18th on the grid, he won again in the rain at Zandvoort  and added a third at the Nürburgring .  But he ran into trouble at Magny-Cours , being penalised in qualifying for passing the chequered flag twice, and crashing into Filip Salaquarda in the race.  , Hülkenberg won the (non-championship) Masters of Formula 3 race at Zolder from team mate (and F3 Euro Series championship leader) Romain Grosjean after Grosjean stalled at the start.  , Hülkenberg won the Formula 3 Euro Series championship in 2008 .

He finished both races in fourth place and this left him in seventh place in the championship. His second race weekend in Qatar , saw him become the first night race pole-sitter, and promptly turned that into becoming the first race-winner under lights after a dominant performance. Such was his performance that he ended up over thirteen seconds clear of second-placed driver Sergio Pérez .  He finished third in the sprint race, taking his championship points tally to 27 from just four races. Despite this, he finished sixth in the championship. , Hülkenberg continued with ART into the 2009 GP2 Series season (partnering Pastor Maldonado ), and took his first win in dominant fashion, during his home round of the series at the Nürburgring . With the series' top eight inverted grid, Hülkenberg started eighth for the sprint race. He won the sprint race as well, becoming the first driver to do the weekend double since Giorgio Pantano at Monza in the 2006 season . In doing so, he became only the second driver to complete the clean sweep, with pole position, two fastest laps and two wins; equalling the achievements of Nelson Piquet, Jr. , who achieved it at the Hungaroring , also in 2006. Hülkenberg clinched the title with two races to spare, after a third place finish in the Monza sprint race, shadowing Brazilians Luiz Razia and Lucas di Grassi home. The result left him with an unassailable 22-point lead heading to the final round, and in the process becoming the first driver to clinch the championship without the need for a final round decider. A fifth win followed at the Autódromo Internacional do Algarve , allowing the German to break the 100-point barrier, and eventually won the title by 25 points from Vitaly Petrov . Worthy of note is that Hülkenberg ended the season 64 points clear of his team mate Pastor Maldonado , who would later go on to get his Williams race seat for the 2011 F1 season.

At the third round in Malaysia , Hülkenberg made it to Q3 for the first time, qualifying in fifth place; out-qualifying team-mate Barrichello for the first time.

Force India 's Adrian Sutil was also linked to replace Hülkenberg at Williams. , On 6 November Hülkenberg gained his first Formula One pole position, by 1.049 seconds over Sebastian Vettel at the Brazilian Grand Prix . This was the Williams team's first pole position since the 2005 European Grand Prix .

He again qualified sixteenth, for the Chinese Grand Prix . He achieved his best Formula One finish with a fourth place at the Belgian Grand Prix . Hülkenberg didn't score any points in Italy or Singapore , but collected points at all of the next five Grands Prix, except on the Yas Marina Circuit where he was involved in a collision on the first lap, and subsequently retired. This was the first time he scored points in more than two races in a row. , In the last race of the season, the 2012 Brazilian Grand Prix , Hülkenberg qualified 7th but was promoted to 6th after Pastor Maldonado received a 10 place grid penalty. By lap three he had moved forward two places and on lap five he passed Fernando Alonso for third place. He moved into second position when McLaren's Lewis Hamilton pitted on lap 11. Hülkenberg then passed Jenson Button at the start of lap 19 to take the lead. He and Button built up a 45-second lead before the safety car was deployed because of debris on the track. He still led until he was passed by Hamilton, after sliding at the entry of Turn 8 on lap 49. On lap 55 he collided with Hamilton when the rear of Hülkenberg's car slid out while trying to pass him at Turn 1. This ended Hamilton's last race for McLaren. After being given a drive-through penalty as a result of the incident, Hülkenberg finished fifth, allowing him to take 11th place in the drivers' championship from Kamui Kobayashi. , Hülkenberg finished the year 17 points ahead of his teammate Paul di Resta and he out-qualified him 12 times, to di Resta's eight. , On 31 October 2012 Sauber confirmed they had signed Hülkenberg for the 2013 season to replace Sergio Pérez , who moved to McLaren.  , Hülkenberg failed to start the Australian Grand Prix due to a leak in the fuel system of his Sauber C32 ; he had qualified eleventh for the race,  but was withdrawn for safety reasons.
