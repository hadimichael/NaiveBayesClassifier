Pérez failed to repeat the result in Malaysia where body parts flew off Sébastien Buemi 's Toro Rosso car and into the electrical system of Pérez's Sauber, forcing his retirement. The Chinese Grand Prix saw him start in 12th position and he struggled during the race as well as making contact with several drivers en route to 17th. He followed that up with fourteenth in Turkey , before a ninth place finish in Spain  – ahead of team-mate Kamui Kobayashi in tenth – to take his first Formula One points. , During the third part of qualifying for the Monaco Grand Prix , Pérez lost control of his car upon exiting the circuit's tunnel section, swung to the right and crashed into the barrier, before sliding across the chicane and hitting the TecPro barrier with a heavy side impact.  Pérez was seen holding his hands around his head in an attempt to protect it just before the final impact. The session was suspended, and marshals and medical personnel extricated Pérez from his car. A Sauber team spokesman confirmed that Pérez was conscious and able to talk after the accident, and had been taken to the circuit's medical centre.  He suffered a sprained thigh and concussion, and did not take part in the race the following day, on medical grounds.

In the dying laps of the race he was able to close the gap to 0.5 seconds, but was not able to make the pass as he went wide at turn 14 and fell back, finishing 2.2 seconds behind Alonso in second. Many observers praised the performance of Pérez during the race despite his late-race error,    taking Sauber's best result as an independent team.  In China , Pérez qualified a career-best eighth, but finished the race in eleventh place after problems with pit strategy and also his car's clutch .  , He finished outside the points in the next three races – despite recording the fastest lap in Monaco   – before Pérez achieved his second career podium at the Canadian Grand Prix , finishing the race in third place, having started fifteenth.  , In the European Grand Prix , Pérez qualified in fifteenth place, citing a handling imbalance and the car feeling \"unpredictable\" as reasons for the gap to Kobayashi in seventh.  He improved to ninth place in the race, but raised poor qualifying form as an issue for the team.  On lap 12 of the British Grand Prix , Pérez collided with Pastor Maldonado , forcing him to retire with broken suspension. He later criticised the Venezuelan , claiming \"Everybody has concerns about him\" before adding, \"He is a driver who doesn't know that we are risking our lives and has no respect at all\".  Maldonado received a double penalty in the form of a reprimand and a €10,000 fine after the race. Pérez later added: \"Just look at the last races. He ruined Hamilton's race (in Valencia), he ruined my race in Monaco by doing stupid things. I don't understand why the stewards don't take a serious decision with him. With Pastor they're not doing anything that will teach him a lesson.\"  , For the German Grand Prix , Pérez started in 17th position but was able to make his way through the field, and ultimately finished the race in 6th place.  At the Belgian Grand Prix , Pérez made it into Q3 and qualified fifth fastest. A penalty for Maldonado subsequently promoted Pérez to a career-best fourth on the grid.  In the race, Pérez was forced to retire in the first turn of the first lap after Romain Grosjean caused a spectacular accident.

Unlike most of the drivers in the field, Pérez started the race on hard tyres and changed to the medium tyres on lap 29,  allowing him to lead the Grand Prix for five laps. As a result, Pérez and his car's outstanding tyre management got him well into the points, and ultimately, to a podium finish. Ultimately, Pérez finished the season in tenth place in the Drivers' Championship with 66 points, 6 more than team-mate Kobayashi.  , On 28 September 2012, Lewis Hamilton 's decision to leave McLaren for Mercedes in 2013 was announced, and Pérez was subsequently confirmed as Hamilton's replacement.

Pérez started the Malaysian Grand Prix from ninth on the grid, and finished the race in the same position, scoring his first points for McLaren. Pérez also achieved the fastest lap of the race, having pitted for fresh tyres.   , In the Bahrain GP , he started 12th on the grid and finishing 6th ahead of Ferrari 's Fernando Alonso (8th) and his teammate Jenson Button (10th), with whom he had a fierce duel in which they touched on a couple of occasions, increasing the competition between drivers in McLaren on the following races.  , After the Bahrain Grand Prix, Jenson Button was quoted with the following on Pérez's driving style: , I've raced with many team-mates over the years and with quite an aggressive team-mate in Lewis , but I'm not used to driving down the straight and then my team-mate coming along and wiggling his wheels at me and banging wheels with me at 300km/h. I've had some tough fights in F1 but not quite as dirty as that. That's something you do in karting and normally you grow out of it but that's obviously not the case with Checo [Pérez]. Soon something serious will happen so he has to calm down. He's extremely quick and he did a great job today but some of it is unnecessary and an issue when you are doing those speeds. , At the 2013 Monaco Grand Prix Pérez performed several aggressive overtaking moves, before retiring after colliding with Kimi Räikkönen. Following the incident Räikkönen said that Pérez should be \"punched in the face\".  Pérez recorded a season-best fifth place finish in India , finishing four seconds shy of the podium, a result that left him \"extremely satisfied\".  , Pérez confirmed on 13 November 2013 that he would be leaving McLaren at the end of the season to be replaced by Kevin Magnussen .  On 12 December 2013 (exactly a month after it was announced he would leave McLaren), Force India confirmed Pérez would join Nico Hülkenberg in their driver line-up for 2014 in a 15 million Euro deal. , On 12 December 2013, Pérez had his drive for Force India in 2014 confirmed.  In the Australian Grand Prix , he finished 11th but was moved up to 10th to get his first point for Force India due to Daniel Ricciardo being disqualified for breaching fuel limits. He failed to start the Malaysian Grand Prix , after his car encountered gearbox issues prior to the start of the race. Nevertheless a week later in the Bahrain Grand Prix , he was able to score Force India's first podium since 2009 ,  holding off Ricciardo's Red Bull for a third place finish.  At the Chinese Grand Prix , Pérez started 16th and after gaining four places at the start, was able to overtake both McLarens and Daniil Kvyat 's Toro Rosso to finish 9th. Outqualifying his teammate for a second time, Pérez started in tenth position for the Monaco Grand Prix however a first lap collision with Jenson Button meant an early retirement for the first time in the season. At the Canadian Grand Prix , Pérez was again fighting for another podium finish until the car suffered braking issues, later resulting in losing the third place position to both Red Bulls. On the last lap he was involved in a collision with Felipe Massa , who crashed into the back of his Force India sending both cars heavily into the barriers. Pérez was subsequently given a five-place grid penalty for the next race, as the stewards decided he changed his racing line, causing Massa to crash into him.  At the Austrian Grand Prix , Pérez set his third fastest lap of his career whilst also giving Force India their third fastest lap in their history. , On 7 November 2014, before the Brazilian Grand Prix , Force India announced that Pérez would remain with the team for the 2015 season.
