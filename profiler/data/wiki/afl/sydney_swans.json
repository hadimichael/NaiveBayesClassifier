  "article": "The Sydney Swans is an Australian rules football club which plays in the Australian Football League (AFL). The club has been based in Sydney , New South Wales since the South Melbourne Football Club was relocated to Sydney in 1982. Sydney was the first club in the competition to be based outside Victoria . The Swans play most home games at the Sydney Cricket Ground , while local derbies and larger games against teams such as Collingwood are played at ANZ Stadium . , Since 1995, the Sydney Swans have made the finals more years than any other club in the same period [ citation needed ] , only missing the finals in 2000, 2002 and 2009. , The South Melbourne Football Club was founded in 1874 and was strong through the 1880s. It won three premierships in 1909 , 1918 and 1933 before experiencing 72 years without a premiership, the longest premiership drought of any club. The club broke the drought in 2005,  and has won one more premiership since, in 2012 . , , , The inauguration date of the club is officially 19 June 1874, and it adopted the name \"South Melbourne Football Club\" four weeks later, on 15 July.  In 1880, South Melbourne amalgamated with the nearby Albert-park Football Club , which had a senior football history dating back to May 1867 (Albert-park had, in fact, been known as South Melbourne during its first year of existence).   Following the amalgamation, the club retained the name South Melbourne, and adopted the club's now familiar red and white colours from Albert-park.  Nicknamed the “Southerners”, the team was more colourfully known as the “Bloods\", in reference to the bright red sash on their white jumpers   (the sash was replaced with a red “V” in 1932).  The colorful epithet the “Bloodstained Angels” was also in use. The club was based at Lake Oval , also home of the South Melbourne Cricket Club . , South Melbourne was a junior foundation club of the Victorian Football Association in 1877, and attained senior status in 1879;  the club amalgamated with the neighbouring Albert-park Football Club in 1880, forming a club which immediately became the strongest in metropolitan Melbourne.  Over its first decade as an amalgamated club, South Melbourne won five VFA premierships – in 1881, 1885 (undefeated), and three-in-a-row in 1888, 1889 and 1890 – and was runner-up to the provincial Geelong Football Club in 1880, 1883 and 1886. , At the end of the 1896 season, Collingwood and South Melbourne finished equal at the top of the VFA's premiership ladder with records of 14–3–1, requiring a playoff match to determine the season's premiership; this was the first time this had occurred in VFA history.  The match took place on 3 October 1896 at the East Melbourne Cricket Ground . Collingwood won the match, six goals to five, in front of an estimated crowd of 12,000.  , This Grand Final would be the last match South Melbourne would play in the VFA, as the following season they would be one of eight founding clubs forming the breakaway Victorian Football League . The other clubs were St Kilda Football Club , Essendon Football Club , Fitzroy Football Club , Melbourne Football Club , Geelong Football Club , Carlton Football Club and Collingwood Football Club . , South Melbourne was one of the original founding clubs of the Victorian Football League that was formed in 1897. , The club had early success and won three VFL premierships in 1909, 1918 and 1933. The club was at its most successful in the 1930s, when key recruits from both Victoria and interstate led to a string of appearances in the finals, including four successive grand final appearances from 1933 to 1936, albeit with only one premiership in 1933. On Grand Final eve, 1935, as the Swans prepared to take on Collingwood, star full-forward Bob Pratt was clipped by a truck moments after stepping off a tram and subsequently missed the match for South. Ironically, the truck driver was a South Melbourne supporter.  , It was during this period that the team became known as the Swans, the nickname having been given courtesy of the number of West Australians in the team (Swans being the state emblem of Western Australia). The name stuck, partially due to the association with nearby Albert Park and Lake , also known for its white swans (although there are no longer any non-native white swans and only black, indigenous swans in the lake). , After several years with only limited success, South Melbourne next reached the grand final in 1945. The match, played against Carlton, was to become known as \"the Bloodbath\", courtesy of the brawl that overshadowed the match, with a total of 9 players being reported by the umpires. Carlton won the match by 28 points, and from then on, South Melbourne struggled. , In the following years, South Melbourne consistently struggled, as their traditional inner-city recruiting district largely emptied as a result of demographic shifts. The club missed the finals in 1946 and continued to fall such that by 1950 they were second-last on the ladder. They nearly made the finals in 1952, but in the following seventeen years South Melbourne did not finish above eighth position. By the 1960s it was clear that South Melbourne's financial resources would not be capable of allowing them to compete in the growing market for country and interstate players, and their own local zone was never strong enough to compensate for this. The introduction of country zoning failed to help, as the Riverina Football League proved to be one of the least profitable zones. , Between 1945 and 1981, South Melbourne played finals only twice: under legendary coach Norm Smith , South Melbourne finished fourth in 1970, but lost the first semi-final; and, in 1977, the club finished fifth under coach Ian Stewart, but lost the elimination final – but there were three wooden spoons in the intervening period, and between Round 7, 1972 and Round 13, 1973, the team lost 29 consecutive games. By the end of the 1970s South Melbourne had massive debts after struggling for such a long period of time. , In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the VFL was strategically interested in seeing a club based in Sydney, as part of a long-term plan to broaden the appeal of the game in Queensland and New South Wales . The league had started moving a few premiership matches to the Sydney Cricket Ground annually since 1979, and in 1981 was preparing to establish an entirely new, 13th VFL club in Sydney; but these plans halted when the South Melbourne board, recognising the difficulties it faced with viability and financial stability in Melbourne, made the decision to play all 1982 home games in Sydney. On 29 July 1981, the VFL formally accepted the proposal, and paved the way for the Swans to shift to Sydney in 1982. , The move caused great internal difficulties, as a group of supporters known as Keep South At South campaigned throughout the rest of 1981 to stop the move; and, at an extraordinary general meeting on 22 September, the group democratically took control of the club's board. However, the new board did not have the power to unilaterally stop the move to Sydney: under the VFL constitution, to rescind the decision that had been made on 29 July required a three-quarters majority in a vote of all twelve clubs, and at a meeting on 14 October it failed to obtain this majority.  The new board also lacked the support of the players, the vast majority of whom were in favour of a long-term move to Sydney; in early November, after the board promised that it would try to bring the club back to Melbourne in 1983, the players went on strike, seeking to force the new board commit to Sydney in the long term, as well as seeking payments that the cash-strapped club owed them from the previous season.  The board ended up undermining its own position when it accepted a $400,000 loan from the VFL in late November to stay solvent, under the condition that it commit to Sydney for two years. Finally, in early December, the Keep South At South board resigned, and a board in favour of the move to Sydney was installed.  , Upon moving, the club played at the Sydney Cricket Ground. In 1982, the club was technically a Melbourne-based club which played all of its home games in Sydney; it dropped the name 'South Melbourne' in June 1982, becoming known as simply 'the Swans' for the rest of that season.  It was not until 1983 that the club formally moved its operations to Sydney and became the Sydney Swans.  Its physical 'home club' was the 'Southern Cross Social Club' at 120a Clovelly Road, Randwick, New South Wales which became bankrupt in 1987; new Sydney Swans Offices were then set up in the Sydney Football Stadium. , On 31 July 1985, for what was thought to be $6.3 million, Geoffrey Edelsten \"bought\" the Swans; in reality it was $2.9 million in cash with funding and other payments spread over five years. Edelsten resigned as chairman in less than twelve months, but had already made his mark. He immediately recruited former Geelong coach Tom Hafey . Hafey, in turn, used his knowledge of Geelong’s contracts to recruit David Bolton , Bernard Toohey and Greg Williams , who would all form a key part of the Sydney side, at a league-determined total fee of $240,000 (less than the $500,000 Geelong demanded and even the $300,000 Sydney offered).  The likes of Gerard Healy , Merv Neagle and Paul Morwood were also poached from other clubs, and failed approaches were made to Simon Madden , Terry Daniher , Andrew Bews and Maurice Rioli .  , During the Edelsten years, the Swans were seen by the Sydney public as a flamboyant club, typified by the style of its spearhead, Warwick Capper , his long bright blond mullet and bright pink boots made him unmissable on the field and his pink Lamborghini, penchant for fashion models and eccentricity made him notorious off the field – all somewhat fashionable in the 1980s . During Capper's peak years, the Swans had made successive finals appearances for the first time since relocating. His consistently spectacular aerial exploits earned him consecutive Mark of the Year awards while his goalkicking efforts (amassing 103 goals in 1987) made him runner up in the Coleman Medal two years running. The Swans' successive finals appearances saw crowds during this time peak at an average of around 25,000 per game. Edelsten also introduced the \"Swanettes\", becoming the sole such cheerleading group among VFL teams following the disbandment of Carlton's Blue Birds in 1986. The Swanettes did not get much performance time, owing to the short intervals between quarters of play in the AFL and the lack of space in which they might perform while other activities take place on the field. The Swanettes were soon discontinued and no AFL club has had cheerleaders since then. , In 1987, the Swans scored 201 points against the West Coast Eagles and the following week scored 236 points against the Essendon Football Club . Both games were at the SCG. The Swans are one of the few teams to have scored two scores above 200 points in a row, the feat also being achieved by Geelong in 1992.  , The club's form was to slump in the following year. , Losses were in the millions. A group of financial backers including Mike Willessee , Basil Sellers, Peter Weinert and Craig Kimberley purchased the licence and bankrolled the club until 1993, when the AFL stepped in. , Morale at the side plummeted as players were asked to take pay cuts.  Legendary coach Tom Hafey was sacked by the club in 1988 after a player-led rebellion at his tough training methods (unusual in the semi-professional days of that era). , Capper was sold to the Brisbane Bears for $400,000 in a desperate attempt to improve the club’s finances. Instead, it only led to disastrous on-field performances. Instead of a 100-goal-a-season forward, Sydney’s goalkicking was led by defender Bernard Toohey with 29 in 1989, then Jim West with 34 in 1990. Players left the club in droves, including Brownlow Medalist Greg Williams , Bernard Toohey and Barry Mitchell . The careers of stars such as Dennis Carroll , David Bolton , Ian Roberts , Tony Morwood and David Murphy came to an end,  while promising young players like Jamie Lawson , Robert Teal and Paul Bryce had their careers cut short by injury. , Attendances consistently dropped below 10,000 when the team performed poorly between 1990 and 1994, with the side winning the wooden spoon in 1992, 1993 and 1994. , The AFL stepped in to save the Swans, offering substantial monetary and management support. The club survived, despite strong rumours in 1992 that it would merge with the Brisbane Bears to form a combined New South Wales/Queensland team, fold altogether, or even move back to South Melbourne. With draft and salary cap concessions in the early 1990s and a series of notable recruits, the team were competitive after the early part of the decade. , During this time, the side was largely held together by two inspirational skippers, both from the Wagga Wagga region of country New South Wales, Dennis Carroll and later the courageous captain Paul Kelly . , Desperate to hang on, the club was keen to enlist the biggest names and identities in the AFL, and recruited legendary coach Ron Barassi who helped save the club from extinction while serving them as coach from Round 7, 1993 to 1995. At roughly the same time, Hawthorn legend Dermott Brereton was also recruited, albeit with little on-field impact. On a much brighter side for the Swans, their captain Paul Kelly won the League's highest individual honour, the Brownlow Medal , in 1995. , A big coup for the club was recruitment of St Kilda Football Club champion Tony \"Plugger\" Lockett in 1995. Lockett became a cult figure in Sydney, with an instant impact and along with the Super League war in the struggling rival rugby league football code in Australia, helped the Swans to become a powerhouse Sydney icon. , 1995 would be Barassi's last year in charge. The Swans won 8 games- as much as they did in the previous three years combined- and finished with a percentage of over 100 (in fact, they have managed such consistently ever since). They were also one of only two teams to defeat the all-conquering Carlton side of that year. Swans great Paul Kelly also won the Brownlow Medal that year. Barassi left an improving team, a club in a much better state than he found them. , Former Hawthorn player Rodney Eade took over the reins in 1996 and after a slow start (they lost their first two games of the season), turned the club around into a competitive force. The Swans ended the minor round on top of the premiership table with 16 wins, 5 losses, and 1 draw. In the finals, the Swans won one of the most thrilling AFL preliminary finals in history after Plugger Lockett kicked a behind after the siren to win the game. The Swans lost the grand final to North Melbourne , which had been their first appearance in a grand final since 1945. The game was played in front of 93,102 at the MCG . , The Swans then made the finals for four of the next five full years that Rodney Eade was in charge of. In 1998 they finished 3rd on the AFL ladder; despite beating St Kilda in their first final the Swans were then beaten by eventual premiers Adelaide in the semi-final at the SCG . , The 1999 season was a largely uneventful year for the club, the only real highlight being Tony Lockett kicking his record-breaking 1300th goal against Collingwood in Round 10. The 1999 season ended with a 69-point mauling at the hands of minor premiers Essendon . , After missing the finals in 2000 , the Swans rebounded to finish 7th in 2001 , but were beaten by Hawthorn by 55 points in their elimination final at Colonial Stadium . , Former Swans favourite son Paul Roos was appointed coach midway through the 2002 season, replacing Rodney Eade. Eade was removed after Round 12, when Roos took over. He had an immediate impact, winning six of the remaining 10 games that year (including the last four of the season), and continuing a record as a successful coach with the Swans for the eight full seasons that would follow. , A new home ground in ANZ Stadium (then known as Telstra Stadium) provided increased capacity over the SCG. The Swans' first game played at the Stadium in Round 9, 2002 against Essendon attracted 54,169 spectators. The Sydney Swans v Collingwood match on 23 August 2003 set an attendance record for the largest crowd to watch an AFL game outside of Victoria with an official attendance of 72,393 and was the largest home and away AFL crowd at any stadium for 2003. A preliminary final against the Brisbane Lions in 2003 attracted 71,019 people. The Swans lost all three of those significant matches. , 2004 saw an average year for Sydney, however one highlight was when they ended St Kilda 's undefeated start to the season in Round 11. The match was notable for Leo Barry 's effort in nullifying the impact of St Kilda's monstrous full-forward and eventual Coleman Medallist Fraser Gehrig , whom Barry restricted to only two possessions for the entire match. , Sydney was able to recruit another St Kilda export in the Lockett mould, Barry Hall . There were obvious parallels to the signing of Lockett (a powerful, tough forward from St Kilda with questions over his discipline and attitude), which left Hall with much to live up to. He flourished in his new surroundings and eventually became a cult figure and club leader in his own right. , As the new century dawned, Sydney implemented a policy of giving up high order draft picks in exchange for players who struggled at other clubs. It was during this era that the Swans picked up the likes of Paul Williams , Barry Hall , Craig Bolton , Darren Jolly , Ted Richards , Peter Everitt , Martin Mattner , Rhyce Shaw , Shane Mumford , Ben McGlynn and Mitch Morton , amongst others, and giving up higher order draft picks meant the Swans missed out on the likes of Daniel Motlop , Nick Dal Santo , James Kelly , Courtenay Dempsey and Sam Lonergan who went to Port Adelaide , St Kilda , Geelong and the latter two to Essendon respectively. This policy is said to have paid off in the Roos era, as they implemented a strict culture of discipline at the club. , Sydney played the AFL Grand Final on 24 September 2005 against the West Coast Eagles , defeating them by four points, final score 8.10 (58) to West Coast's 7.12 (54). In the last few minutes, the Sydney defence held strong, with Leo Barry marking the ball just before the siren to stop the Eagles' final desperate shot at goal. The premiership was the Swans' first in 72 years and their first since being based in Sydney. It was also the fifth premiership in succession to be won by a team from outside Victoria . , In 2005, the Swans came under enormous public scrutiny, even from AFL CEO Andrew Demetriou for their unorthodox, \"boring\" defense-oriented tactics that included tightly controlling the tempo of the game and starving the opposition of possession (in fact, seven teams that season had their lowest possession total whilst playing against the Swans). The coach Paul Roos maintained that playing contested football was the style used by all recent premiership winning teams, and felt that it was ironic that the much criticised strategy proved ultimately successful. , On Friday, 30 September 2005 a ticker tape parade down Sydney's George Street was held in honour of the Swans' achievements, which ended with a rally at Town Hall , where Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore presented the team with the key to the city. The flag of the Swans also flew on top of the Sydney Harbour Bridge during the week; the same flag was later given to WA premier Geoff Gallop to fly on top of the state legislature in Perth as part of the friendly wager between Gallop and NSW premier Morris Iemma . , The 2006 AFL Grand Final was contested between the Sydney Swans and West Coast Eagles at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 30 September 2006. The West Coast Eagles avenged their 2005 Grand Final defeat by beating the Sydney Swans by one point, only the fourth one-point Grand Final margin in the competition's history. , The rivalry between the Sydney Swans and West Coast Eagles has become one of the great modern rivalries.  The six games between the two sides (from the start of the 2005 finals to the first round of 2007 inclusive) were decided by a combined margin of 13 points. Four of those six games were finals, and 2 Grand Finals. , Sydney finished the 2007 home and away season in 7th place, and advanced to the finals, where they faced and were defeated by Collingwood by 38 points in the elimination final. It was their earliest exit from the finals since 2001 and was a culmination of a mostly disappointing season, as only victories against lesser teams saw them through to a fifth consecutive finals campaign. , The conclusion of the 2007 trade saw the loss of Adam Schneider and Sean Dempster to St Kilda , the delisting of Simon Phillips , Jonathan Simpkin and Luke Vogels , and the gain of Henry Playfair from Geelong and Martin Mattner from Adelaide . , The Swans spent the middle part of the 2008 season inside the top four, however a late form slump which yielded only three wins in the last nine rounds saw the Swans drop to sixth at the conclusion of the 2008 regular season. Having qualified for the finals for a sixth consecutive season, the Swans defeated North Melbourne in the elimination final before losing to the Western Bulldogs the following week. , 2009 saw the club register only eight victories as they failed to reach the finals for the first time since 2002, finishing 12th with a percentage of below 100% for the first time since 1994. Barry Hall , Leo Barry , Jared Crouch , Michael O'Loughlin , Amon Buchanan and Darren Jolly all departed at the conclusion of the season, with Mark Seaby , Daniel Bradshaw and Shane Mumford , among others, joining the club during the trade period. , The 2010 season saw Sydney return to the finals by virtue of a fifth-place finish at the end of the regular season. The club defeated Carlton by five points in the elimination final before losing to the Western Bulldogs in the semi-finals for the second time in three seasons. The loss signalled the end of the Swans coaching career of Paul Roos as well as that of the playing career of Brett Kirk . , Former North Melbourne premiership-winning forward John Longmire took over as coach of the Swans as part of a succession plan initiated by Paul Roos in 2009 prior to the beginning of the 2011 season. He led the club to a seventh-place finish at the end of the regular season, therefore qualifying for the finals for the 13th time in the past 16 seasons. The Swans defeated St Kilda in an elimination final at Docklands Stadium before losing to Hawthorn in the semi-finals the following week. , It was during the regular season that the Swans caused the upset of the season, defeating the star-studded Geelong Cats on its home ground, Skilled Stadium , where the home tenant had won its past 29 games in succession, and its past two matches at the ground by a combined margin of 336 points, in Round 23. It was the Swans' first win over the Cats since 2006 and its first win at the ground since Round 8, 1999. The Swans were also the only team to defeat the West Coast Eagles at Patersons Stadium during the regular season. The Swans' victory over Geelong was overshadowed by the news that co-captain Jarrad McVeigh 's baby daughter had died in the week leading up to the match, forcing him to miss that match. , The 2012 season began for the Swans with the inaugural Sydney Derby against AFL newcomers Greater Western Sydney . After an even and physical first half, Sydney went on to win by 63 points. Subsequent wins over Fremantle , Port Adelaide , North Melbourne and Hawthorn saw the Swans sit second behind West Coast on percentage after Round 5, but the Swans would proceed to lose three of their next four matches before embarking on a nine-match winning streak between Rounds 10 and 19 inclusive. The Swans eventually finished the regular season in third place after losing three of their final four matches, all against their fellow top-four rivals (Collingwood, Hawthorn and Geelong in Rounds 20, 22 and 23 respectively). , The Swans defeated Adelaide by 29 points in their qualifying final at AAMI Stadium , thus earning a week off and a home preliminary final, where they then defeated Collingwood by 26 points to qualify for their first Grand Final since 2006, ending an eleven-match losing streak against the Magpies in the process. , In the Grand Final, the Swans defeated Hawthorn by ten points in front of 99,683 people at the MCG, with Nick Malceski kicking a snap goal with 34 seconds left to seal the Swans' fifth premiership and first since 2005. , The Swans' 2013 season was marred by long-term injuries to many of its key players, namely Adam Goodes , Sam Reid, Lewis Jetta , Rhyce Shaw and Lewis Roberts-Thomson , among others; despite this setback, the team were still able to reach the finals for the fifteenth time in 18 seasons, reaching the preliminary finals where they were defeated by Fremantle at Patersons Stadium , its first loss at the venue since 2009.   , The 2014 AFL season began with some difficulties for the Swans. Sydney lost their first game against Greater Western Sydney and then to Collingwood before becoming the first non South Australian team to win at Adelaide Oval defeating Adelaide by 63 points with Lance Franklin and Luke Parker kicking 4 goals each. After a loss to North Melbourne in Round 4, the Swans' won twelve games in a row, including victories against 2013 Grand Finalists Fremantle and Hawthorn, Geelong by 110 points at the SCG and then ladder leaders Port Adelaide. In Round 17, the Swans defeated Carlton to match a winning streak set three times in club history, the last of which came way back in 1935,  and eventually closed out the season with their first minor premiership in 18 years and a club record 17 wins for the season, eclipsing the previous highest of 16, which was achieved on six past occasions in 2012, 1996, 1986, 1945, 1936 and 1935. In 2014 the Swans were minor premiers, and also qualified for the 2014 AFL Grand Final . They defeated the Fremantle at home in the first qualifying final in Round one of the finals series and so earned a one-week break. In the first preliminary final the Swans had a convincing win against North Melbourne , which led them to their fourth grand final in 10 years. The 2014 AFL Grand Final was played on Saturday the 27th September 2014 in near perfect weather conditions, with Sydney seen as favourites leading up to the match. This was the first time in a finals series that former Hawk player Lance Franklin would play against his former team, one of very few players to have played back to back grand finals for two different teams. The Hawks dominated the game quite early and eventually defeated the Swans 11.8.(74)to 21.11.(137). The 63 point loss was Sydney's biggest ever loss in a grand final and their biggest defeat all season meaning Hawthorn would become back to back premiers for the second time in their history. , The Swans' continued period of success, in which it has missed the finals only three times since 1995, has led to some criticism about a salary cap concession which the club receives; the concession is in the form of an additional Cost of Living Allowance (COLA), due to the higher cost of living in Sydney compared with any other Australian city.   It was, however, announced in March 2014 that this allowance would be scrapped.  , The jumper is white with a red back and a red yoke with a silhouette of the Sydney Opera House at the point of the yoke. The Opera House design was first used at the start of the 1987 season, replacing the traditional red \"V\" on white design. Until 1991, the back of the jumper was white with the yoke only extending to the back of the shoulders and each side of the jumper had a red vertical stripe. The current predominantly red design appeared at the start of the 1992 season. The club's major sponsor is QBE Insurance . In 2004 the club added the initials 'SMFC' in white lettering at the back of the collar to honour the club's past as South Melbourne Football Club. The move was welcomed by Melbourne-based fans. The clash guernsey is a predominantly white version of the home guernsey, including a white back, but it is rarely used, since Melbourne, Gold Coast and Brisbane are the only clubs with which there is a clash.  , International Sports Clothing have manufactured the Swans' apparel since 2010 , replacing long-time sponsor Puma SE .  , , The Sydney Swans' mascot for the AFL's Mascot Manor is Syd 'Swannie' Skilton. He is named after Swans legend Bob Skilton . The actual mascot at Sydney's home games is, however, still known as Cyggy (as in cygnet ). , As the only AFL club in Sydney prior to the 2012 entry of Greater Western Sydney , the Swans have a large population base to draw on. In 2006, following the first premiership in 72 years, the club achieved a record membership and the biggest since 1999. There is still a healthy Melbourne following for the Swans, particularly a revival in the late 1990s. The club experiences good support when the team plays in Melbourne and many also make the long trip to Sydney for home games as well. The club recently celebrated in 2007 their 25th anniversary since relocating from South Melbourne , with parties hosted both in Sydney and their former home. , Some famous fans include movie star Nicole Kidman ,  singers Shannon Noll ,  Delta Goodrem , Australian band Human Nature , Australian duo The Presets , radio personalities Peter Stubbs and Adam Spencer , television personality Ian \"Dicko\" Dickson ,  media personalities Sandra Sully ,  Neil Cordy and John Mangos , former cricket legend Glenn McGrath , television presenter Tom Williams , musician Holly Throsby , politician Malcolm Turnbull , Philadelphia Eagles punter Mat McBriar , sports journalist Tony Squires , television actress Cornelia Frances and Prime Minister Tony Abbott ,  amongst others. , ¹following finals matches , The introduction of the GWS Giants to the AFL in 2012 has resulted in the formation of the Sydney Derby . The Swans compete against their cross-city rivals twice every season. The best performed player from every derby match is awarded the Brett Kirk Medal . , The Swans have created a recent rivalry with Hawthorn due to the two teams contesting the 2012 and 2014 Grand Finals, with the Swans winning the 2012 Grand Final by 10 points. Hawthorn would, however, exact revenge and beat the Swans by 63 points. The signing of Lance Franklin by the Sydney Swans in 2013 only added fuel to the fire, and his only performance worth mentioning against his old club was the 2014 Grand Final. Between the two clubs, they have won five premierships since 2008. , The Swans developed a famous modern rivalry against the Perth-based West Coast Eagles between 2005 and 2007, when six consecutive games between the two teams, including two Qualifying Finals and two Grand Finals, were decided by less than a goal. The rivalry was highlighted by Sydney's four-point win against West Coast in the 2005 Grand Final , and West Coast's one-point win against Sydney in the 2006 Grand Final . , The Swans have a strong rivalry with the Brisbane Lions , which is based on the ongoing sporting and political rivalry between the two states New South Wales and Queensland . [ citation needed ] Since the mid-1990s the two sides have played for the Alan Schwab Shield, named after the late AFL administrator who worked to establish the two sides in traditional rugby league territory. Between them, the two clubs have won five premierships since 2001. , The Swans share a historical rivalry with St Kilda which dates back to the club's time in South Melbourne. The rivalry was a local derby, as South Melbourne played at the Lake Oval on the opposite side of Melbourne's Albert Park Lake to St Kilda's old home ground, Junction Oval . Because the Swans and the Saints used to be towards the bottom of the ladder on a regular basis after the Second World War up until St Kilda's move away from the Junction Oval, clashes between both sides used to be played for the \"Lake Premiership\". , Head coach , Assistant coaches , , The Swans currently field a reserves team in the North East Australian Football League . Previously a reserves team was first created for South Melbourne in 1919 and continued to compete in the Victorian reserves competition until 1999 despite the team relocating to Sydney in 1982. The team enjoyed little success in the Victorian competition; it was the only reserves team never to win a premiership, and its best performances were losing Grand Finals in 1927, 1956 and 1980. In 2000 the Swans entered a reserves team in the Sydney AFL competition but withdrew prior to the finals series because the club felt the difference in standard was too greatly in favour of the Swans. Between 2001-2002 the Swans affiliated themselves with the Port Melbourne Football Club in the VFL while also starting a new stand-alone team named the Redbacks in the Sydney AFL competition. Little success resulted and the Swans entered a stand-alone reserves team in the AFL Canberra competition in 2003 which resulted in four consecutive premierships between 2005-2008. In 2011 the Swans reserves team joined the North East Australian Football League with the rest of the AFL Canberra competition and now have regular matches against AFL reserve teams from the Brisbane Lions , Gold Coast Suns and GWS Giants .
