The club's current coach is Adam Simpson , and the current captain is Shannon Hurn . From the 2014 season onwards, the East Perth Football Club , playing in the West Australian Football League (WAFL), has served as West Coast's reserves team , with West Coast players previously distributed among all WAFL teams. , , , The West Coast Eagles were selected in 1986 as one of two expansion teams to enter the Victorian Football League (VFL) the following season, along with the Brisbane Bears .  Ron Alexander was appointed as the team's inaugural coach in September 1986, with the inaugural squad, comprising a majority of players from the West Australian Football League (WAFL), unveiled in late October.  Ross Glendinning , recruited from North Melbourne , was made the club's first captain as one of the few players with previous VFL experience. The team's first senior match in the VFL was played against Richmond at Subiaco Oval in late March 1987, with West Coast defeating Richmond by 14 points.  Having won eleven games and lost eleven games for the season, the club finished eighth out of fourteen teams. At the end of the season, John Todd , the coach of Swan Districts in the WAFL, replaced Alexander as West Coast's coach.  The club made the finals for the first time in 1988, but lost form the following season, winning only seven games to finish 11th on the ladder.  Todd was sacked at the end of the 1989 season , and was replaced by Michael Malthouse , who had previously coached Footscray .  With the competition having rebranded itself as the Australian Football League (AFL) at the start of the 1990 season, West Coast finished third on the ladder at the conclusion of the home-and-away season, and progressed to the preliminary final before losing to Essendon , having been forced to play four consecutive finals in Melbourne .  , John Worsfold replaced Steve Malaxos as captain for the 1991 season , and the club finished the season as minor premiers for the first time, losing only three games.

Having slipped to third in 1993, the club finished as minor premiers the following season, and went on to again defeat Geelong in the grand final to win its second premiership in three years.  In 1995, a second AFL team based in Western Australia, the Fremantle Football Club , with the two clubs' subsequent rivalry branded as the \" Western Derby \".  West Coast made the finals in every year that remained in the 1990s, but failed to reach another grand final, with a fourth-place finish in 1996 their best result.  Worsfold retired at the end of the 1998 season , and was replaced by his vice-captain, Guy McKenna , who served as captain until his retirement two seasons later.  , Malthouse left West Coast at the end of the 1999 season to take up the senior coaching position with Collingwood , and was replaced by Ken Judge , who had been coach of Hawthorn .  The 2000 and 2001 seasons were marked by a rapid decrease in form after the loss of several key senior players, culminating in a 14th-place in 2001, at the time the worst in the club's history. Round eighteen of the 2000 season marked the club's final match at the WACA Ground , which had been used concurrently with Subiaco Oval since the club's inception.

Ben Cousins was made sole captain of the club in 2002, having shared the role with Dean Kemp the previous season.  During this time, the team was boosted by a number of high picks in the AFL Draft gained as a result of the previous poor finishes. Chris Judd , who had been taken with pick three in the 2001 National Draft , won the Brownlow Medal as the best player in the competition in 2004, becoming the first West Coast player to win the award.  In 2005, the Eagles finished second on the ladder after the regular season, and progressed to the grand final against Sydney , where they were defeated by four points.

West Coast had a strong preseason and won their opening three matches, although they eventually finished in ninth position.  During the season the club were labeled as \"flat track bullies\" due to beating lower placed teams by large margins, yet failing to defeat teams above them on the ladder.  Midfielder Matt Priddis became the third Eagles player to win a Brownlow medal, winning the 2014 medal at the end of the season.  , The West Coast Eagles have been owned in full by the West Australian Football Commission (WAFC) since 1989.
