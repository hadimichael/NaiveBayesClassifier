The Moscow Army men won their 10th national title back in 2006 and they are one of the most successful clubs in Russian football, having an extensive legacy in Soviet football as well. CSKA won the Soviet championship seven times (1946, 1947, 1948, 1950, 1951, 1970, 1991), silver – 1938, 1945, 1949, 1990, bronze – 1939, 1955, 1956, 1958, 1964, 1965; the Soviet Cup five times (1945, 1948, 1951, 1955, 1991); the Russian Cup in 2002, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2013; won the Russian Premier League champions title in 2003, 2005, 2006,2012–13,2013-14 finishing second in 1998, 2002, 2004, 2008 and 2010, bronze 1999, 2007, 2012 and the Russian Super Cup in 2004, 2006, 2007, 2009,2012–13.

In 2004, the club received a major financial infusion from a sponsorship deal with Sibneft, an oil company owned by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich . Abramovich did not take an ownership interest in the club, as he was the owner of English Premier League club Chelsea and UEFA rules allow only one club controlled by any one entity (person or corporation) to participate in European club competition in a given season. The partnership with Sibneft lasted until 2006, when VTB became the sponsor of the club.

It was considered offensive, but later it was transformed into The Horses , and currently this nickname is used by players and fans as the name, along with other variants such as Army Men ( Russian : армейцы ) and Red-Blues ( Russian : красно-синие ). , CSKA has its own stadium called \" Light-Athletic Football Complex CSKA \" and abbreviated as LFK CSKA. Its capacity is very small for a club of its stature; no more than 4,600 spectators. This is one of the primary reasons the club uses other venues in the city.
