  "article": "Feyenoord Rotterdam ( Dutch pronunciation: [ˈfɛi̯əˌnoːrt] ) is a Dutch professional football club, from the Feijenoord district of Rotterdam , playing in the Eredivisie . Founded as Wilhelmina in 1908, the club changed its name to SC Feijenoord in 1912, SC Feyenoord in 1974,  and Feyenoord Rotterdam in 1978, when SC Feyenoord became a separate amateur team. Since 1937, Feyenoord's home ground has been Stadion Feijenoord, nicknamed De Kuip . , Feyenoord is one of the most successful clubs in the Netherlands, winning 14 Eredivisie titles, 11 KNVB Cups and two Johan Cruijff Shields . The club also has won one European Cup , two UEFA Cups and one Intercontinental Cup . The club is historically one of the three clubs that have dominated the Eredivisie (first tier) of Dutch football, the others being Ajax and PSV . These three clubs have always played in the Eredivisie, since its inception in 1952, and have never been relegated to lower divisions. , Feyenoord is known as a people's club, with a huge national support. The club's most successful period in history was the 1960s and '70s when Coen Moulijn and Ove Kindvall led the club to six league titles, two European trophies, an Intercontinental cup and thereby becoming the first Dutch club to win the European Cup and the Intercontinental Cup. , Feyenoord has a longstanding rivalry with Ajax, as a clash between the two biggest cities in The Netherlands, which is called De Klassieker (The Classic). The club's anthem is \"Hand in Hand\". , , , The football club Wilhelmina was founded in the pub De Vereeniging on 19 July 1908  and played in blue-sleeved red shirts and white shorts.  Between 1908, 1910, 1911 and 1912, the club underwent a series of changes of name and team colours, becoming Hillesluise Football Club in 1909  and then RVV Celeritas . Upon earning promotion to the National football association in 1912, the club renamed to become SC Feijenoord, after the city district in which the team was founded  and again changed uniform, adopting the red and white shirts, black shorts and black socks they still wear today.  In 1917, Feijenoord were promoted to the highest level of Dutch football, 1e klasse (1st division) and moved to the ground Kromme Zandweg .  , Sixteen years after the formation of the club and a mere three years after they were promoted to the highest level of Dutch football Feijenoord earned their first honours by capturing the national league championship in 1924.  The team enjoyed a string of successes in the latter half of the decade, taking divisional titles in 1926, 1927, 1928 and 1929, and winning their second national championship in 1928.  , Feijenoord won their first Dutch Cup in 1930 by scoring the only goal in a derby final against Excelsior .  They continued to dominate their division with three consecutive titles, but were winless in subsequent championship finals. Five years after their first cup win, Feijenoord took the prize for a second time in 1935, by beating Helmond Sport .  , Feijenoord started to attract more fans to their stadium at Kromme Zandweg, and in 1933, they decided to build a new facility. The club moved to the Feijenoord Stadion (nicknamed \"De Kuip\" or \"the Tub\") in 1937, playing the first match there on 27 March against Beerschot .  During this period Feijenoord won three consecutive division titles from 1936 to 1938, with their third and fourth national championships coming in 1936 and 1938.  , During World War II , Feijenoord played their matches at Sparta Rotterdam 's Kasteel , as the Nazis had occupied De Kuip.  When Het Kasteel was unavailable due to clashes with Sparta fixtues, Feijenoord played at their former ground, the Kromme Zandweg.  , Feijenoord's again won a division title with a national championship in 1940, their fifth Dutch title. During the German occupation of the Netherlands, play continued in Dutch football leagues, though the 1945 championship was cancelled as the war came to its conclusion.  During this period, Feijenoord's only trophy was a divisional championship in 1943. After the war, Feijenoord did not perform as well as they had in previous decades, not seriously challenging in their division and so missing the national playoff rounds. , On 30 June 1954, the chairmen of the three biggest Rotterdam teams organised a meeting in Utrecht , which was attended by several chairmen of other clubs and a delegation of the KNVB to discuss the start of professional football in the Netherlands.  The professional era commenced with the first Eredivisie season in 1954/1955.  Feijenoord were one of the clubs participating in the inaugural Eredivisie and have never been relegated.  One of the most memorable matches in these first years of professional football was the clash between Feijenoord and the Volewijckers at 2 April 1956, which Feijenoord won 11–4 with nine goals by Henk Schouten . Feijenoord would grow an intense rivalry with AFC Ajax . Matches between the two clubs quickly were dubbed as 'de Klassieker' (The Classic). The first memorable Klassieker from a Feijenoord point of view took place at 11 November 1956, when Daan den Bleijker scored four times to give Feijenoord a 7–3 win over their arch rivals.  , Feijenoord claimed their first professional Eredivisie Championship and their sixth Dutch Championship in history in 1961.  On the road to the title Ajax were beaten 9–5 in De Kuip, four of Feijenoord's goals were scored by Henk Schouten.  The following season, they played their first European Cup match facing IFK Göteborg . The Swedes were beaten 0–3 in Gothenburg and 8–2 in Rotterdam.   Feijenoord were eliminated by Tottenham Hotspur in the following round.  In 1962 Feijenoord successfully defended their Dutch Championship title and reached the final of the Intertoto Cup 1961-62 .  Feijenoord faced arch-rivals Ajax in the final, which was won by the Amsterdam team 4–2.  , On 12 December 1962, Feyenoord played a decisive match versus Vasas SC in the second round of the European Cup 1962-63 . The first two legs, in Rotterdam and Budapest both ended in 1–0 home victories, and a replay on a neutral ground took place.  The match was played in Antwerp , Belgium and 30,000 Feijenoord fans travelled by bus to see their team play.  For the third time the final score was 1–0, with the only goal scored by Rinus Bennaars who was immediately nicknamed \"The hero of Deurne\" (the neighbourhood in Antwerp where the match was played).  The events in Antwerp resulted in an enduring friendly relationship between the fans of Feyenoord and Royal Antwerp FC .  , In 1963, hundreds of thousands of people stood ashore by the Nieuwe Maas and the Nieuwe Waterweg to wave two ships, de Groote Beer and the Waterman goodbye. The ships transported thousands of Feijenoord fans to Lisbon where the club faced Benfica on 8 May 1963 in the European Cup semi-finals.  The first leg, held in Rotterdam a month earlier, finished 0–0.  Feijenoord eventually lost the match against Benfica 3–1, but this turned out to be the start of the most successful period in the club's history.  Feijenoord won the double for the first time in their history in 1965, and managed to win another double a few years later in 1969.  The 1965 title secured Feijenoord a spot in the 1965–66 European Cup , where they faced multiple cup champions Real Madrid on 8 September 1965 in the preliminaries. During the match, Hans Kraay had to leave the pitch injured after 31 minutes, without being substituted. He returned at the start of the second half and scored the goal which resulted in a 2–1 win. Later during the match, fans' favourite Coen Moulijn was attacked roughly by a Spanish defender. Moulijn then chased the defender all over the pitch. Several other players did the same, as did some fans who entered the pitch. The referee could do nothing, but suspend the match at 2–1 in Feijenoord's favour. Two weeks later, Real Madrid comfortably beat Feyenoord 5–0, and eventually won the European Cup that season.  , As the 1969 Dutch champions, Feijenoord participated in the 1969–70 European Cup . After thrashing Knattspyrnufélag Reykjavíkur 16–2 on aggregate in the first round, the club faced Milan .  Feijenoord lost the first leg 1–0 in Italy, but overcame the deficit in their own stadium following a 2–0 win, securing a place in the quarter-finals, where they faced ASK Vorwärts Berlin .  , The tie followed the same pattern as the previous round, Feijenoord losing the first match 1–0 away, then winning 2–0 at home.  In the semi-finals, Legia Warszawa were beaten 2–0 on aggregate, earning Feijenoord their first European final.  Ajax had reached the same final in 1969, but were not able to win.  Feijenoord faced Celtic in the final, held in the San Siro stadium in Milan . Goals by Tommy Gemmell and Rinus Israël resulted in a 1–1 draw after 90 minutes. Three minutes before the end of extra time, Ove Kindvall scored Feijenoord's winning goal to make them the first Dutch team to claim a major European trophy.  , As reigning European champions, Feijenoord faced Estudiantes La Plata in the Intercontinental Cup .  The first match in Buenos Aires ' La Bombonera finished in a 2–2 draw. Back in Rotterdam, Feijenoord managed a 1–0 victory (winning goal by Joop van Daele ) to win the world club crown, the first Dutch team to do so.  Estudiantes player Oscar Malbernat got frustrated and grabbed Van Daele's glasses and trampled on them. \"You are not allowed to play with glasses... at least not in South America\" was his excuse.  As the cup holders, Feijenoord participated in the 1970–71 European Cup despite relinquishing the Dutch title, which was won by Ajax. Feijenoord were eliminated in the first round, following a surprise defeat by the Romanian team UT Arad .  In 1971, Feijenoord won their 10th Dutch Championship.  , In 1974, the club changed their name from Feijenoord to Feyenoord , as people from outside the Netherlands did not know how to pronounce Dutch ij .  Under their new name, they played in the 1973-74 UEFA Cup, reaching the final, following a 4–3 aggregate win over VfB Stuttgart in the semi finals.  The opponent in the final was Tottenham Hotspur. Spurs took a 2–1 lead in the first leg at White Hart Lane , but Theo de Jong equalised after 85 minutes and the match ended in a 2–2 draw.  Feyenoord then won their match in Rotterdam 2–0, thanks to goals by Wim Rijsbergen and Peter Ressel , and also became the first Dutch team to win the UEFA Cup .  As a result, Spurs fans started to riot,  introducing Dutch football to the spectre of hooliganism in the process. The remainder of the decade saw Feyenoord win only one more honour: the Dutch Championship in 1974.  In 1978, the club divided their professional and amateur sides to form two separate teams, Feyenoord Rotterdam for professionals and SC Feyenoord for amateurs.  , Feyenoord won their fifth Dutch Cup in 1980 by beating Ajax 3–1 in the final.  In 1984, Feyenoord had another bright season, winning the double for the third time in their history.  Key players in the squad from this period included Johan Cruyff , Ruud Gullit and Peter Houtman (who later became the Feyenoord stadium announcer).  Cruyff reacted to Ajax's decision not to offer him a new contract at the start of the season and signed for arch rivals Feyenoord instead.  Cruyff's move to Rotterdam was criticised and increased Ajax's motivation to beat Feyenoord. In the Olympic Stadium of Amsterdam Feyenoord suffered one of their most heavy defeats ever: 8–2.  However, Feyenoord later defeated Ajax in Rotterdam 4–1 and Ajax were subsequently beaten a second time in the Dutch Cup.  Feyenoord proceeded to win a league and cup double by beating Fortuna Sittard in the cup final.  , After the successful season, Feyenoord experienced a lean period and were unable to finish the season in a higher position than third.  In the 1989–90 season, the club struggled to remain in the Eredivisie, but eventually managed to avoid relegation.  The club had financial problems, and as a result, the staff was not able to recover and their main sponsor, HCS went bankrupt.  , When Wim Jansen was appointed as the interim manager to replace Günder Bengtsson and Pim Verbeek after a 6–0 defeat against PSV, the outlook began to improve for the club.  PSV, the strongest Dutch club of the period, were knocked out of the KNVB Cup by a Henk Fräser goal in Eindhoven . Feyenoord progressed to the 1991 final, where they beat BVV Den Bosch 1–0 to win the competition.  As the cup holders, they faced champions PSV again, this time in the 1991 Dutch Supercup , the first Supercup held since 1949. PSV were beaten 1–0 by a Marian Damaschin goal to add another honour to the club's achievements.  They went on to win another Dutch Cup in 1992, beating Roda JC 3–0 in the final.  The same year, Feyenoord reached the semi-finals in the 1991–92 European Cup Winners' Cup , beating Tottenham Hotspur in the quarter-finals, before being knocked out by AS Monaco on away goals, after two draws.  , In 1993, Feyenoord secured another Dutch Championship by beating FC Groningen 5–0 in the last league match of the season.  The match was played at the Oosterpark Stadion in Groningen , so 40.000 Feyenoord fans watched the game on giant screens in De Kuip.  The title was followed by another two Dutch Cups in 1994 (beating NEC Nijmegen 2–1) and 1995 (beating FC Volendam 2–1).  During the 1994–95 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup , Feyenoord reached the quarter finals after beating Werder Bremen in the second round. They eventually lost to Real Zaragoza .  In the quarter-finals in the 1995 KNVB Cup , Feyenoord visited Ajax, the team that would win the 1994–95 UEFA Champions League later that season. Ajax was leading 1–0 when Ruud Heus equalised with a penalty just before time. In the extra time, Feyenoord became the only team to beat Ajax the season they won the Eredivisie and the Champions League unbeaten. The goal scored by Mike Obiku was the decider as the new golden goal rule became in use.   During the 1995–96 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup , Everton and Borussia Mönchengladbach were beaten. A total of 14,000 Feyenoord fans travelled to Germany to support the team against Mönchengladbach.   Feyenoord were knocked out in the semi-finals by a Carsten Jancker inspired Rapid Wien .   , Feyenoord made their UEFA Champions League debut during the 1997–98 UEFA Champions League , finishing third in their group behind Manchester United and Juventus . However, Juventus were beaten 2–0 in Rotterdam, both goals scored by Julio Ricardo Cruz .  In 1998, the FIOD-ECD (Fiscal Information and Investigation Service/Economic Investigation Service) visited Feyenoord because of suspected fraud,  mainly based on the signings of Aurelio Vidmar , Christian Gyan and Patrick Allotey .  This became an ongoing scandal in the years to come with chairman Jorien van den Herik as the main suspect.  On 25 April 1999, Feyenoord secured their 14th Dutch Championship. 250,000 fans celebrated with the team in the center of Rotterdam. However, later in the evening, heavy rioting started.  Before the start of the new 1999–2000 season, Ajax were beaten in their own stadium when Feyenoord won their second Dutch Super Cup title, after a free kick by Patrick Paauwe , which secured a 3–2 win.  , During the 1999–2000 UEFA Champions League , Feyenoord participated in the UEFA Champions League for the second time. This time, the club managed to finish second in their group behind Rosenborg BK , but in front of Borussia Dortmund .  Feyenoord reached the second group stage and secured wins versus Olympique Marseille (at home) and Lazio (away). Chelsea won both clashes and as a result, Feyenoord had to win their last group match away to Marseille to reach the knock-out stages. The final result was 0–0, and Feyenoord were eliminated.  , Feyenoord again participated in the Champions League in 2001–02 , finishing third in a group containing Bayern Munich , Sparta Prague and Spartak Moscow .  This meant Feyenoord had to continue their European season in the 2001–02 UEFA Cup instead of the second Champions League group stage.  The disappointment of failing to reach the second group stage eventually resulted in optimism and celebration. By winning over SC Freiburg and Rangers , Feyenoord faced fellow Dutch team PSV in the quarter-finals.  Both matches ended in 1–1 draws, and the clash went into extra time and a penalty shoot-out.  Pierre van Hooijdonk , who had a superb season by scoring many goals from free kicks secured Feyenoord's win by scoring in the 90th minute equalizer before finishing PSV off by scoring the last goal in the penalty shoot-out.  A 1–0 win in Milan against Internazionale , and a 2–2 return match in Rotterdam, earned Feyenoord their spot in the final, in which Borussia Dortmund was the opponent.  The final was held in De Kuip and as a result, most spectators inside the stadium were Feyenoord fans. Feyenoord took a 2–0 lead, thanks to another free kick and a penalty by Pierre van Hooijdonk.  Early in the second half Marcio Amoroso scored a goal to make it 2–1. Jon Dahl Tomasson then made it 3–1 and things looked good for Feyenoord.  Dortmund only managed to score one more goal and the cup was won by Bert van Marwijk 's Feyenoord.  , A huge party erupted in and outside De Kuip not only because of the title, but also because the final was held several days after Rotterdam's political figure Pim Fortuyn was murdered.  Lots of fans were still full of emotion, before and after the match. As a result of Fortuyn's murder, the cup was not officially celebrated in the city center.  , The 2002 UEFA Cup win was the start of a long dry spell for Feyenoord. In the 2002–03 season, the club managed to finish third in the national league, as well as reach the final of the Dutch Cup (which was lost 1–4 to FC Utrecht ), but in the following years, Feyenoord disappointed in both the national league and the Dutch Cup. , In between, Feyenoord and chairman Jorien van den Herik were found to be not guilty in 2002. The prosecutor however appealed, but in 2005, after three years of investigations, the results stayed the same. Still, the prosecution has not given up the case yet.  , The 2005–06 season ended in disappointment for Feyenoord. The team pursued the Dutch Championship for most of the season, but eventually lost out to PSV.  The newly created Dutch play-offs then proved to be gloomy for Feyenoord. Ajax, which finished several points behind in the regular league, were Feyenoord's opponent in the play-offs. Ajax ouclassed them and Feyenoord lost out on a Champions League place.  , In the 2006–07 season, the nightmare grew even bigger. The supporters saw their two star players leave to Chelsea ( Salomon Kalou ) and Liverpool ( Dirk Kuyt ). At the same time, it became clear that Feyenoord were in an appalling financial state despite earlier comments made by chairman Van den Herik who claimed that the club was financially healthy. Supporters' unrest grew into anger, when Feyenoord bought Charisteas , a back-up striker of arch-rivals Ajax, with a poor track record, as a replacement for Kuyt. After continuous protests, chairman Van den Herik resigned, and the club started managerial reforms. The worst was not over though. Feyenoord were banned from European competition, following hooliganism prior to and during a match with AS Nancy ,  despite an appeal by the club.  The season ended in bitter disappointment with a seventh-place finish, causing Feyenoord to miss European football for the first time in 16 years. While desperate supporters started preparing for a dark age, the club surprised friend and foe in the 2007 summer transfer window. A brilliant performance of young left back Royston Drenthe at the 2007 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship had investors flocking to the new investment schemes Feyenoord had set up. The club appointed former manager Bert van Marwijk and was able to make a number of high-profile signings amongst which Giovanni van Bronckhorst and Roy Makaay . Despite the efforts, Feyenoord underperformed once again in the national league, finishing in a disappointing sixth place. The pain was relieved by claiming the first prize in six years: 100 years after the foundation of the club, Feyenoord managed to win the Dutch Cup, beating Roda JC by 2–0. As Bert van Marwijk accepted a job as manager of the national team, Feyenoord appointed Gertjan Verbeek as their manager for the 2008–09 season. , In the 2008–09 season, Feyenoord officially celebrated their 100th birthday and organised many events throughout the year. The old \"golden logo\" returned as Feyenoord's official logo, which was presented at the 2007 new years brunch.  During the summer a historical tournament was held between Feyenoord and the three opponents they met in the European Cup finals, they played, Borussia Dortmund, Tottenham Hotspur and Celtic ( Feyenoord Jubilee Tournament ).  , Mid-way through the season manager Verbeek was sacked because of disappointing league results. His assistant, Leon Vlemmings, then took over the job as manager. The results in this period improved slightly, resulting in securing a spot in the playoffs for the final Dutch Europa League slot. , For the 2009–10 season, Feyenoord appointed former assistant manager and Feyenoord footballer Mario Been to take over from Leon Vlemmings. Been, after achieving minor European successes with NEC Nijmegen , was considered the ideal man for the job. Former manager Leo Beenhakker, at that time manager of the Polish national squad, took over the role as Technical Director. Partly because of this position, he was able to attract more investors to the club leading to some unexpected signings, such as Sekou Cissé , Dani Fernández and Stefan Babović . , On 24 October 2010, they lost to PSV with a 10-0 score. In mid-January 2011 Leo Beenhakker resigned after multiple clashes between him and the Feyenoord Directors.  His replacement was former Feyenoord player Martin van Geel , who at the time was working as Technical Director for fellow Eredivisie club Roda JC.  , In July 2011, a majority of players in the squad voted to oust Been as club manager. Thirteen out of eighteen players voted that they had lost all confidence in Been's ability to successfully manage the club.  Been's subsequent sacking became global news, if only because reports of Been's firing quickly became a trending topic on Twitter, leaving people around the world to wonder who exactly Mario Been was.  , After Louis van Gaal turned down an offer to manage Feyenoord, the club sought out legendary former Barcelona defender Ronald Koeman , who had played for Feyenoord during the late 1990s. With his eventual hiring as Feyenoord manager, Koeman became the first to ever serve as both player and head coach at all teams of the so-called \" traditional big three \" of Dutch football: ( AFC Ajax , PSV Eindhoven and Feyenoord itself) Moreover, he played and managed these teams in the same order.  , At the beginning of the 2011–12 season, Feyenoord lost valuable players Leroy Fer , Georginio Wijnaldum and André Bahia to FC Twente , PSV Eindhoven and Samsunspor respectively. In return, the club restocked with players such as Jordy Clasie , Miquel Nelom , Guyon Fernandez and Kaj Ramsteijn , who came mostly from their own youth academy. Two other players were loaned, John Guidetti from Manchester City and Otman Bakkal from PSV. Feyenoord started the season well and played the first game of the Eredivisie, against the other Rotterdam club in the league Excelsior. Feyenoord ended the season by placing second in the Eredivisie, resulting in the third qualifying round for Champions League football.  , On 16 December 2011, it was revealed that Feyenoord had been placed in the more favorable second category (Categorie 2). Meaning that Feyenoord were no longer in debt according to the KNVB . They have earned this by the transfer of significant players and a large capital injection made by the organisation VVF (Friends of Feyenoord, Vrienden Van Feyenoord). However to stay in the second category, Feyenoord needed to obtain the same amount of points earned rounding up to or higher than 65 points.  On 13 April 2012 Feyenoord was officially out of what has been described as the 'financial dangerzone' and was officially placed in the second category. According to chairman of the club Eric Gudde the placing in the more favourable category came earlier than anticipated, he also congratulated the fans and promised to maintain the same policy until Feyenoord was completely healthy again and will never fall back into the first category.   , Despite not having to ask the KNVB for permission to invest in new players anymore, Feyenoord kept continuing the policy for the 2012-13 season, only contracting players that were either out of contract or available for a low transfer fee. John Goossens ,  Ruud Vormer  and Daryl Janmaat  were out of contract and signed a deal with Feyenoord over one with their old clubs. Mitchell te Vrede  played for the affiliated football club Excelsior , as well as for the highest-ranked academy team Jong Feyenoord/Excelsior and was promoted to the main senior team. Harmeet Singh  and Lex Immers  are thus far the only two players who Feyenoord paid a transfer fee for. Singh, a Norwegian midfielder and one of two non-Eredivisie players joining Feyenoord, was purchased from Valerenga IF , while Immers came over from ADO Den Haag . The other non-Eredivisie player joining Feyenoord was Omar Elabdellaoui who was loaned from Manchester City.  , On 2 July 2012, Karim El Ahmadi completed his transfer from Feyenoord to Premier League club Aston Villa for an undisclosed fee believed to be in the region of €2,600,000. This made him Paul Lambert 's first signing as Aston Villa manager, and Aston Villa's second signing of the summer (following Australia international Brett Holman 's move from AZ ).  , On 15 July 2012, supporters of Aston Villa uploaded a picture on Twitter which showed Ron Vlaar , Feyenoord captain since season 2010/2011, visiting the Villa Park stadium in Birmingham. Which had Martin van Geel confirm to the media that Vlaar wanted to leave Feyenoord.   After the incident Villa did not contact Vlaar, to which coach Ronald Koeman set up a deadline for The Villans, which ended on 23 July 2012, however Villa was on a pre-season tour of the US and thus not able to respond. On 23 July 2012, Vlaar told the public that he would not leave Feyenoord after all, and said that he felt that he was kept dangling by Aston Villa.    Four days later however Vlaar told the public that he would eventually be joining Villa, as he had agreed personal terms and would sign for Villa subject to him passing a medical. On 1 August 2012, Vlaar officially joined Aston Villa, signing a three-year contract. Feyenoord supporters received the news generally mixed, with some congratulating and wishing the best of luck, others feeling betrayed by Vlaar for misleading them.  , Stefan de Vrij would be taking up the vacant spot for captain, considering his time and experiences with Feyenoord, making Jordy Clasie , who because of his good play and tenacity soon became one of the most popular players among the supporters, vice-captain.  , On 7 August, Feyenoord had lost the third qualifying round of the Champions League against Dynamo Kyiv in both legs, which would secure a spot in the play-offs. Feyenoord was demoted to the play-off round of the UEFA Europa League . Ronald Koeman has said that Feyenoord was the better side over the two legs but missed a scoring striker, referring to John Guidetti , the loaned player from Manchester City one season earlier.  , On 10 August 2012, Dutch-international and Málaga C.F. defender Joris Mathijsen confirmed signing a contract with Feyenoord for three years. Málaga had made clear to Mathijsen that he needed to find a new club to generate income for the financially suffering Málaga after Sheikh Al Thani left. Ronald Koeman has however kept de Vrij as captain, despite Mathijsen being more experienced on international and club level.  , After drawing the first leg of the UEFA Europa League qualifier at home with 2-2 Feyenoord lost the second leg with a 2-0 win for AC Sparta Praha which meant that for the 2012–2013 season, Feyenoord would not be playing European football.  Following these events Feyenoord loaned Parma F.C. and old AZ striker Graziano Pellè  and exchanged Jerson Cabral for FC Twente striker Wesley Verhoek , no fee was involved within this trade.  Feyenoord ends the season in third place after Ajax and PSV . Graziano Pelle surprises many people by scoring 27 goals in 29 matches, after which he signs a contract keeping him at Feyenoord until the summer of 2017. , In the 2013-2014 season, Feyenoord had the worst start in history, despite having maintained all of its important players. The first three games were all lost, against PEC Zwolle , FC Twente and Ajax respectively.  After that, Feyenoord recovers from its bad start, but its performances stay quite unstable throughout the season. The other top teams in the Eredivisie are very inconstant as well, which keeps Feyenoord in the race for the title. Eventually they end second, just 4 points behind Ajax .  In the Europa League Feyenoord loses in the third qualifying round against FC Kuban Krasnodar , making it Feyenoord's fifth consecutive season without European football.  , On February 1, Ronald Koeman announced he would quit coaching Feyenoord at the end of the season. On March 3, Fred Rutten is appointed the new manager for the 2014-2015 season.  , The 2014-2015 season follows after a turbulent summer, where Feyenoord loses four of its best players ( Daryl Janmaat to Newcastle United , Stefan de Vrij to Lazio Roma , Bruno Martins Indi to FC Porto , and Graziano Pelle to Southampton – Ronald Koeman 's new club). To replace them and some other departed players, Feyenoord signed Warner Hahn from FC Dordrecht , Luke Wilkshire from Dynamo Moscow Khalid Boulahrouz from Brøndby IF , Bilal Başaçıkoğlu from SC Heerenveen , Colin Kazim-Richards from Bursaspor , Jens Toornstra from FC Utrecht , Kenneth Vermeer from Ajax and Karim El Ahmadi from Aston Villa .  With all these new players, and a new coach, Feyenoord has a bit of a disappointing start of the season with only 5 points after 4 matches. , However, Feyenoord does succeed to place themselves for the Europa League for the first time in six years. After they lost to Besiktas on a 5-2 aggregate in the third qualifying round of the Champions League,  they defeated FC Zorya Luhansk in the final qualifying round of the Europa League on a 5-4 aggregate.  , Feyenoord won with 2-1 against Standard Liège in their first home match in Group G of the Europa League. It was the first victory for Feyenoord in the Europa League group stage in 8 years. Feyenoord also beat HNK Rijeka (2-0) and defending champion Sevilla FC (2-0) in their own stadium and that was enough for Feyenoord to reach the knock out rounds for the first time in 10 years. In the knock out rounds Feyenoord lost against AS Roma on a 3-2 aggregate. After the loss against AS Roma, Feyenoord didn't recover. Even though a spot for next season's Europa League qualification rounds was almost secure, they didn't win any of their last 5 games, ending in the fourth spot, behind AZ Alkmaar on the last day of the season. During the play-offs to gain a ticket for Europa League they got knocked out by Heerenveen, leaving them completely empty handed this season. , Feyenoord are located in the Feijenoord district of southern Rotterdam and is named after the district in which the club was founded.  More frequent appearances in international tournaments led the club to change its name in 1974, because foreign fans unfamiliar with the Dutch language did not know how to pronounce ij .  Beside Feyenoord, there are two other professional football clubs in Rotterdam: Sparta and Excelsior . Feyenoord is currently playing in the Eredivisie , while Sparta was relegated to the second tier after the 2009–10 season.  Two years later Excelsior also relegated from the Eredivisie in the season 2011–12 . , The club's Feijenoord Stadion , located in the IJsselmonde district of Rotterdam, is nicknamed De Kuip , Dutch for The Tub .  It was built in 1937 and is one of the major European stadiums.  It has 51,117 seats and has hosted a record of 10 finals of UEFA club competitions, including the 2002 UEFA Cup Final which was won by Feyenoord.  Former Feyenoord player Mike Obiku once said \"Every time you enter the pitch, you're stepping into a lion's home.\"  Feyenoord does not own the stadium, it is an organisation on its own.  , In 1935, Feijenoord player Puck van Heel hit the first pole on their way into their new stadium. The stadium was opened on 27 March 1937 and Beerschot was beaten by 5 goals to 2, Leen Vente scored the first goal in De Kuip.  Already in the very beginning the stadium was sold out on several occasions and other events held at de Kuip also gained lots of attendance.  During the second World War the stadium was one of the few locations which was not bombed, however the Nazis occupied the stadium.  After the war De Kuip became popular location once again. In 1949 the attendance record was broken during the match to decide the Dutch championship between SVV Schiedam and SC Heerenveen ; 64,368 fans visited the match.  , Besides football, there were also boxing and motorcycle speedway races in De Kuip, which were also gaining popularity. In 1953, people had to hide inside the stadium during the North Sea flood of 1953 .  On 27 November 1957, Feyenoord played versus Bolton Wanderers during an evening match. It was the first time the floodlights were taken in use.  The players entered the pitch in the dark and the fans were asked to light their matchsticks when the floodlights were activated. Since that evening, that match at De Kuip has always been special among Feyenoord fans.  , In 1963, De Kuip hosted their first European final (Cup winners' Cup) between Tottenham Hotspur and Atlético Madrid . Nine more European finals would follow in the years after with Feyenoord's win over Borussia Dortmund in the 2002 UEFA Cup final being the 10th and latest.  The attendance record of 1949 was broken in 1968 when 65,427 fans visited the Feyenoord- FC Twente match.  , In December 2006, Feyenoord director Chris Woerts announced that Feyenoord were developing plans to build a new stadium which would have a capacity of roughly 90,000 seats. The stadium would most likely be placed on the Nieuwe Maas , the river that runs through Rotterdam, and should be completed by 2016.  In May 2008, Woerts announced further details: the club is aiming for a stadium with a capacity of around 100.000 seats.  If possible, a capacity of over 130.000 should be realized according to Woerts, which would earn the title of biggest stadium in Europe. The club emphasized its efforts to make it a true football stadium with seats close to the pitch. The stadium will get a retractable roof so that other events can be held as well. According to plans in those days, the stadium should be ready in 2016. Due to financial difficulties for all parties involved and the fact that The Netherlands did not get to organize the FIFA World Cup of 2018, the plans for a new stadium have been put on hold. A new stadium will probably be built in the future, but it will likely not have a capacity of more than 70.000. , In September 2012 Feyenoord confirmed that there will arise a new stadium in 2018. The stadium will be built by builder VolkerWessels , it will cost around 300 million euros (± £242 million). Another option was a plan made by a consortium of BAM , Eneco Energie and Siemens . But the plan was rejected by the Feyenoord and Stadion Feijenoord direction. The new stadium should be a 63.000 all-seater. Despite the new plans, much of the supporters prefer a renovation of De Kuip. One of those initiatives are 'Red de Kuip', which is Dutch for 'Save de Kuip'.  They made plans of building a 3rd tier on top of the current stadium, increasing the capacity to 68000. This plan would cost only 117 million euros (± £94 million). , Feyenoord's official hymn since 1961 is called \"Hand in Hand\" .  Its melody was written in the 19th century by German Wilhelm Speidel  ( de ) . In 1961, Jaap Valkhoff wrote the lyrics which became popular among Feyenoord supporters who adopted the song as their unofficial hymn.  Valkhoff wrote lyrics on the same melody for several other teams as well. Among them were Feyenoord's arch rivals Ajax.  Nowadays the song is heard wherever Feyenoord play their matches, but also fans of MVV and Club Brugge have their own version that they sing.  , When a goal is scored by Feyenoord in their home matches the song I Will Survive , covered by the Hermes House Band , but made famous by Gloria Gaynor in the 1970s is played.  , Feyenoord supporters are known to be creative and have a lot of various songs and chants in their equipment during matches. Among the most important Feyenoord songs are \"Mijn Feyenoord\" by Lee Towers ,  \"Feyenoord, wat gaan we doen vandaag?\"' by Cock van der Palm  ( nl )  and \"De laatste trein naar Rotterdam\" by Dorus .  During the 2001/02 season when Feyenoord won the UEFA Cup a parody was launched of the song \"Put your hands up\" by Black and White Brothers called \"Put your hands up for Pi-Air\" as a tribute to Pierre (Pi-Air) van Hooijdonk.  In the 1970s Coen Moulijn also had a song dedicated to him named \"Coentje Coentje Coentje\" .  , The supporters of Feyenoord are said to be one of the most loyal supporter groups in the world supporting the team during both good or bad times.   They are nicknamed Het Legioen , Dutch for The Legion and can be found everywhere in The Netherlands and far across the Dutch borders. Squad number 12 is never given to a player, but is reserved for Het Legioen instead. , Feyenoord is a popular club in the Netherlands with a large number of supporters.  The team's first training session of a season alone attracts thousands of fans;  20,000 attended 2007–08 's inaugural session.  , In 1963, about 3000 fans boarded on two ships, among thousands of others by train or car and they travelled to Lisbon where Feyenoord faced Benfica in the European Cup .  When Feyenoord play abroad in European competition, about 8000 travel together to support their team.  Almost 15,000 fans were cheering for their team in 1996 when Feyenoord played in Germany versus Borussia Mönchengladbach .  About 40,000 fans visit a regular match at home while top classes versus Ajax, PSV and European Cup opponents are sold out most of the time.  About 250,000 fans showed up when Feyenoord's latest Dutch championship was celebrated in 1999 at the Coolsingel in the center of the city.  After Feyenoord beat Internazionale in the 2002 UEFA Cup semi final, Inter midfielder Clarence Seedorf said: \"I really enjoyed the atmosphere in the Kuip. As an ex-Ajax player I was really given the bird, but that’s all part of the emotions in football. It also illustrates the intense way in which the Feyenoord supporters experience their club’s matches.\"  A number of the club's followers acknowledge a very close link with English side Sunderland, although it is an association that is often unwelcome and denied by the authorities. Over 100 Feyenoord supporters attended a function in Sunderland on the evening before their fixture with Newcastle in April 2015 and a similar number of Sunderland fans made the journey to watch the Dutch side in their ultimately delayed fixture against Vitesse Arnhem. , Beyond the Netherlands, Feyenoord opened a fanshop in the center of Tokyo , Japan when Japanese player Shinji Ono was a key player at the club, and also in South Korea when Song Chong-Gug played for Feyenoord.  , Feyenoord have one official fan supporters club, the Feyenoord Supportersvereniging.

Children between 0 and 12 years old can join the Kameraadjes group (English: little comrades).  , In 1998 the Feyenoord Supporters Vereniging were wondering about whether or not it would be possible to create more atmosphere inside the stadium mainly during important matches. As a result, a few huge flags were produced and brought into the stadium prior to matches played by Feyenoord.  The flags were a success, but people started asking for more activities and a meeting between fans and officials were arranged. In 2000 Harry Veth was given permission to establish a group of five Feyenoord fans called TIFO team Feyenoord Rotterdam.  Besides creating more flags and small pieces of paper released from the second platform the team also started to organise bigger activities. The first big activity was held on 10 December 2000 when Feyenoord faced Ajax and 40 fog machines were activated when the players entered the pitch.  In the following years many different and various activities were held to improve the atmosphere inside the stadium. Feyenoord's TIFO team became famous abroad as well and the Italian TIFO foundation awarded Feyenoord the Best of TIFO Award 2000/01.  , Feyenoord's Jeugdproject (Youth Project) concentrate on children between 6 and 12 years of age, playing football at schools and amateur teams.  To show the kids the importance of sports and sportsmanship, Feyenoord invite the children to De Kuip to see what sport can do to people: happiness, disappointment, excitement, emotions, fear and cosines, it brings people together.  In Feyenoord's Youth Project visiting a match is the central point, but there is also an educative and cultural character included.  Feyenoord provide schools and amateur clubs with small teaching books and expect these to be filled in by the visiting youth when they enter the stadium on a match day.  The groups that support Feyenoord in the most original way and those who can predict the score correctly are awarded with prizes.  , A few weeks after the first training but still before the season really starts, the club open their doors for free for all Feyenoord fans to have fun together and to present the squad for the upcoming season.  De Kuip already opens in the morning when there are many activities around the stadium mainly for kids and promotional activities for companies which have a partnership with Feyenoord.  Fans can also take a stadium tour and walk on the pitch. The activities inside the stadium itself normally start around noon when there are several performances by various artists. Every year the new Feyenoord ambassador of the year is announced at opening day.  A minute of silence will be held for all former Feyenoord players who have died and for known fans who have died in the previous year.  Former Feyenoord players return to De Kuip every year to play versus a team of Dutch celebrities.  The stadium activities end after the squad for the upcoming season is presented to the fans. This is always a special happening, mainly for the new signings of the team. They will be flown into the stadium with helicopters when a full stadium is cheering for them when they arrive.  Once they are there the other players and club officials enter the pitch one by one. Last but not least, all players are available for autograph sessions afterwards.  Feyenoord's open day attracts about 60,000 to 70,000 fans towards Rotterdam, coming from all over The Netherlands, while there's only 51,117 seats available inside the stadium.  The opening day is known as a unique event in the Netherlands. , Notable supporters of Feyenoord include Craig Bellamy ,  Gerard Cox ,  Frans Timmermans , Mark Rutte , Wouter Bos ,  Jan Marijnissen ,  Robert Eenhoorn ,  Arjan Erkel ,  Dennis van der Geest ,  DJ Paul Elstak ,  Raemon Sluiter ,.  , Raemon Sluiter , Lee Towers , Dennis van der Geest , Robert Eenhoorn and Renate Verbaan have all officially been Feyenoord ambassadors. Gerard Meijer is the current ambassador, and was appointed 'ambassador for life' on 19 July 2008. , Ajax from Amsterdam are Feyenoord's arch rivals.  The two clubs share a long history together and matches between the two clubs are called the Klassieker (The Classic)  The rivalry is not only between the two teams, but also a confrontation between the two largest cities of the country, Amsterdam and Rotterdam, two cities with extreme differences in attitude and culture.  The meeting between the two teams is still considered to be the biggest game of the season.  In the past there have been many clashes between the supporters of both clubs, of which the Beverwijk clash in 1997 is the most infamous, with Ajax fan Carlo Picornie being killed and several others injured.  In 2004 Feyenoord player Jorge Acuña was taken to hospital with head, neck and rib injuries after Feyenoord players were attacked by Ajax hooligans during a match between the reserve teams of both clubs.  Another Feyenoord player, Robin van Persie , had to be rescued by Ajax coach John van 't Schip and player Daniël de Ridder .  Then in 2005 riots before and after the match happened in Rotterdam and were considered to belong to the worst in the history of Dutch football.  , Rotterdam is the city with the most professional teams in the Netherlands. Besides Feyenoord there are Sparta Rotterdam and Excelsior and the city is often referred to as \"Voetbalstad nummer 1\" (English: Football city number 1).   There is a rivalry between the teams, mostly between Feyenoord and Sparta as Excelsior can be seen as Feyenoord's feeder club, but it is not comparable to other local derbies . The rivalry between Sparta and Feyenoord is mostly seen on the Sparta side.  Some Sparta fans have refused to enter Feyenoord's De Kuip stadium, even when Sparta had reached the KNVB Cup final, which was played in De Kuip.  In the 1950s there was much more of a rivalry. One of the key factors for these feelings was footballer Tinus Bosselaar , who moved from Sparta to Feyenoord in 1954 before Sparta re-signed him, despite Feyenoord trying to prevent the deal in court.  , Feyenoord also have a fierce rivalry abroad against Tottenham Hotspur , who following several violent clashes with the club, coupled with a link to Ajax, are not popular with the Rotterdam club.

The purpose of this is to allow them to experience regular first-team football, aiding their development while simultaneously strengthening Excelsior's squad. The highest profile players to have played at Excelsior as part of this arrangement are Thomas Buffel and Salomon Kalou , who were both subsequently involved in transfer deals worth several million Euros.   The partnership between Feyenoord and Excelsior was scaled back in 2006, though the clubs still work together.  , Feyenoord's co-operation with Újpest FC started when Hungarian ex-footballer and former Feyenoord player Jószef Kiprich joined the Hungarian team as an under 19 coach and started as a scout for Feyenoord.  , The Feyenoord Ghana academy in arose form a visit by Feyenoord chairman Jorien van den Herik to Abidjan to sign the then unknown Bonaventure Kalou , when Van den Herik contacted with the education institute at Kalou’s club.

At the time Feyenoord's shirts were produced by Adidas and the first main sponsor became the Dutch Yellow Pages called Gouden Gids.  In the second half of the 1982–83 season Adidas were replaced by Puma as the shirt supplier.  As a result, the Gouden Gids name was enlarged and was more visible on the shirts.  Gouden Gids sponsored the team until 1984, when Opel became the new sponsor.  The deal between Feyenoord and Opel lasted until 1989, but in 1987 Puma no longer produced the shirts, but Hummel International .  In 1989 Hummel produced the shirts sponsored by HCS . Adidas came back to the club in 1990, at the time that HCS got into big financial troubles and got bankrupt and was unable to sponsor Feyenoord any longer.  Where HCS left Adidas stayed and the new main sponsor became Stad Rotterdam Verzekeringen .  This turned out to be a longterm deal as they were Feyenoord's main sponsor until 2004, when it was overtaken by Fortis .

When Fortis faced near bankruptcy, its assets were divided among several companies. The same insurance branch that sponsored Feyenoord before became ASR. To help with their brand recognition they decided to continue Fortis former sponsor obligations. In 2011 they announced that they would stop their sponsorship deal in the season 2012/2013. Due to economic recession Feyenoord had trouble finding a new shirt sponsor. Because of this Feyenoord and ASR reached a compromise. ASR would remain sponsor for one more season, giving Feyenoord the time it needs to find a suitable candidate. After negotiations with a few candidates, it became clear that Opel would become the new sponsor. The German car manufacturer signed a contract until 2018. , 2014   PEC Zwolle "
