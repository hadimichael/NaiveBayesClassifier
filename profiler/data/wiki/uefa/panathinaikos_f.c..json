( Greek : Παναθηναϊκός Αθλητικός Όμιλος , transliterated \"Panathinaikos Athlitikos Omilos\", Panathenaic Athletic Club ) are a Greek professional football club based in the city of Athens . Panathinaikos can literally be translated as \"Panathenaic\", which means \"of all Athens\". The name \"Panathinaikos\" was inspired by the ancient work of Isocrates Panathenaicus , where the orator praise the Athenians for their democratic education and their military superiority, which use it for benefit of all Greeks.  , Today a part of Panathinaikos A.O. , they are the oldest active football club in Greece . Founded in 1908 as \"Podosfairikos Omilos Athinon\" ( Football Club of Athens ), they play in the Super League Greece are one of the most successful clubs in Greek football and is one of three clubs which have never been relegated from the top division. They have won 20 Greek Championships , 18 Greek Cups , 5 Greek Super Cups and 8 Doubles . Other titles include 6 Panhellenic Championships (before 1927). Panathinaikos is also the most successful Greek club in terms of achievements in the European competitions. It is the only Greek team that has reached the European Cup (later changed to UEFA Champions League ) final in 1971, and also the semi-finals twice, in 1985 and 1996. It is also the only Greek team that has played for the Intercontinental Cup (1971). Furthermore, they have reached the quarter-finals of UEFA Champions League two more times (in 1992 and 2002) and also the quarter-finals of UEFA Cup twice (in 1988 and 2003). They have won also once the Balkans Cup in 1977. , Since the 50's the club maintains one of the oldest and most successful Academy in Greece producing and preparing new footballers for the first team and feeding also the Greek national football team . Panathinaikos F.C. became professional and independent in 1979. They have played their home games in the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium – which is considered as their traditional home ground – and the Athens Olympic Stadium . , According to the vast majority of researches and polls, it is the second most popular football team in Greece.         and the most popular in greater Athens and the region of Attica .  The club has million of fans inside Greece and millions of others in the Greek communities all over the world. Panathinaikos FC currently is the only supporter-owned football club in Greece. , They hold a long-term rivalry with Olympiacos and matches between the two teams are referred to as \" Derby of the eternal enemies \".  , , , According to the official history of the club, Panathinaikos was founded by Giorgos Kalafatis on 3 February 1908, when he and 40 other athletes decided to break away from Panellinios Gymnastikos Syllogos following the club's decision to discontinue its football team.  The name of the new club was \"Podosferikos Omilos Athinon\" ( Football Club of Athens ). It was founded with the aim of spreading and making more known this new sport ( football ) to the Athenian and Greek public in general. Also, Kalafatis' intension was to create a team for all Athens, a team for the capital. First president was selected to be Alexandros Kalafatis , brother of Giorgos. The colours of the team were red and white and its home ground was in Patission Street .  Oxford University athlete John Cyril Campbell was brought in as coach. It was the first time that a foreigner was appointed as the coach of a Greek team.  Konstantinos Tsiklitiras , the great Greek athlete of the early 20th century, played as goalkeeper for the new team. , In 1910, after a dispute among a number of board members, Kalafatis with most of the players - also followed by Campbell - decided to pull out of POA and secured a new ground in Amerikis Square. Subsequently, the name of the club changed to Panellinios Podosferikos Omilos (\"Panhellenic Football Club\") and its colours to green and white. By 1914, Campbell had returned to England but the club was already at the top of Greek football with players such as Michalis Papazoglou , Michalis Rokkos and Loukas Panourgias . , In 1918, the team adopted the trifolium ( shamrock ) as its emblem, as proposed by Michalis Papazoglou .  In 1921 and 1922, the Athens-Piraeus FCA organized the first two post- WWI championships, in both of which PPO was declared champion. By that stage, the club had outgrown both the grounds in Patission Street and Amerikis Square, due mainly to its expansion in other sports, and began to look at vacant land in the area of Perivola on Alexandras Avenue as its potential new ground.  After long discussions with the Municipality of Athens , an agreement was finally reached and in 1922 Leoforos (\"Avenue\" in Greek) was granted to the club.  , The move to a permanent home ground also heralded another – final – name change, to Panathinaikos Athlitikos Omilos (PAO) , \" Panathenaic Athletic Club \", on 15 March 1924,  from now on a multi-sport club . However, the decision was already taken by 1922. , In 1926, the Hellenic Football Federation was founded and the first Greek Championship under its authority took place in 1927. , Panathinaikos won undefeated the Championship of 1929–1930 under the guidance of József Künsztler and Angelos Messaris as the team's star player.  Other notable players of this Belle Époque period of the team were Antonis Migiakis , Diomidis Symeonidis , Mimis Pierrakos , Stefanos Pierrakos and more. They thrashed rivals Olympiacos 8–2, a result that still remains the biggest win either team has achieved against its rival, with Messaris scoring three goals.  The team won also Aris 1-4 in Thessaloniki . Messaris, who scored again three goals, became a hero and chant for the fans. , In 1931, a serious disagreement between leading board member Apostolos Nikolaidis and Messaris,  which lasted two years, damaged the club and led to a counterproductive period. In the meantime, the HFF Greek Cup had commenced in 1932. The last bright moment for the Greens before World War II was winning the Cup for the first time in 1940 against Aris (3–1). , In 1940, with the break out of the Greco-Italian War , many players of the club joined the Hellenic Army . Mimis Pierrakos was killed during the war (later during the 50's his bones were transferred from Albania back to Athens). During the Axis Occupation of Greece (1941–44) many players of the team became members of PEAN resistance organization.,  while Michalis Papazoglou had a leading role in the resistance group of Jerzy Iwanow-Szajnowicz . , After this long crisis period, Panathinaikos had to wait until 1949 to win again a Greek Championship under the guidance of the Austrian coach Johann Strnad . The same year Vangelis Panakis and Kostas Linoxilakis came to the club and quickly became the new star players. Panathinaikos was again champion for the 1952–53 Panhellenic Championship . , Until 1959, the team had also won seven of the last eight Athens Championships , the regional championships organised in Greece. In 1959, Mimis Domazos , the emblematic captain of the team, made his first appearance with Panathinaikos and the same year took place the first season under the new system of Alpha Ethniki ( 1959–60 Alpha Ethniki ). Panathinaikos was the champion team. , During the next years Panathinaikos were again champions in 1961 , 1962 , 1964 , 1965 , 1969 and 1970 . Moreover, the team won 2 more Greek Cups in 1967 and 1969 . Also, during these years, a long process of rejuvenation took place in the club. Notable players retired, such as Panakis, Linoxilakis, Takis Loukanidis and Andreas Papaemmanouil , and the team had to count on young players like Domazos, Antonis Antoniadis , Anthimos Kapsis , Kostas Eleftherakis and Takis Ikonomopoulos . , Stjepan Bobek was the main contributor to this process. In 1963 he came as coach, he changed the playing style of the team (to 4-3-3) and created a new team based on young players (the \"Bobek's rejuvenation\"). Under his guidance, Panathinaikos won the Championship of 1964 without a loss, making them the only team that has won the Greek Championship (with its modern system) undefeated.  Notable players of the team included Panakis, Domazos, Takis Ikonomopoulos , Totis Filakouris , Frangiskos Sourpis and Aristidis Kamaras . , With the establishment of the Greek military regime , the president of the club Loukas Panourgias was forced out of the presidency. The contract of Stjepan Bobek was canceled by the State, while Apostolos Nikolaidis , the old player, manager and official of the club, went on trial.  , In 1967, the great Béla Guttmann came as coach, but he soon left and ex-player Lakis Petropoulos was appointed. Under his guidance Panathinaikos won the championships of 1969 (with a Double) and 1970. , In 1971, under the guidance of Ferenc Puskás , Panathinaikos were 1970–71 European Cup finalists, the first and only Greek team until today, losing 2–0 to Ajax at Wembley Stadium .  In the road to the final they eliminated Jeunesse Esch , Slovan Bratislava , Everton and Red Star Belgrade .   Notable players included the former captain Mimis Domazos , Anthimos Kapsis , Aristidis Kamaras , Kostas Eleftherakis , Totis Filakouris and the goalkeepers Takis Ikonomopoulos and Vasilis Konstantinou . Antonis Antoniadis was the top scorer in the competition scoring 10 goals. , In the same year, Panathinaikos played for the 1971 Intercontinental Cup (due to the refusal of Ajax to participate), where they lost to Nacional (1–1 in Greece, 2–1 in Uruguay).  Totis Filakouris was the scorer for the Greek club. , During the last amateur years of Greek football, the Trifolium won one more Championship in 1972. Antonis Antoniadis was again top scorer with 39 goals (also second in Europe). His record remains until today in the Greek league. , With the collapse of the militay regime , Apostolos Nikolaidis became again active for the club and was appointed honorary President of Panathinaikos. In 1975 one of the greatest coaches of his era, the Brazilian Aymoré Moreira , who mainly worked in Brazil ( World Cup Champion with Brazil national football team in 1962), was appointed. After one and a half year and not good results he was replaced by Kazimierz Górski . With Górski, Panathinaikos won the Double in 1977. Another important moment for the club the same year was winning the Balkans Cup of 1977.  Notable foreign players who played for the team during the late '70s include Juan Ramón Verón , Araquem de Melo and Óscar Marcelino Álvarez . , In 1979, Greek football turned professional. The Vardinogiannis family, who are mostly known for their oil refining , oil exploration , media and entertainment enterprises, purchased PAO's football department and Giorgos Vardinogiannis became president.  Panathinaikos were one of the first Greek clubs that formed a women's team in 1980 but that department is currently inactive. , The transformation period lasted a few years but in 1982 they won their first professional era trophy, the Greek Cup , and during the 1980s they would go on winning two championships ( 1984 , 1986 ), four more Greek Cups ( 1984 , 1986 - with a 4-0 against Olympiakos in the final –, 1988 , 1989 ) and the Greek Super Cup in 1988. The star of the team during these years was Dimitris Saravakos , while other players included Nikos Sarganis , Spiros Livathinos , Velimir Zajec , Juan Ramón Rocha , Christos Dimopoulos and Giannis Kyrastas . , In the 1984–85 season, Panathinaikos with coach Jacek Gmoch and stars Dimitris Saravakos , Velimir Zajec , Juan Ramón Rocha and Ioannis Kyrastas made a run in Europe, eliminating Feyenoord , Linfield and Göteborg to reach the semi-finals of the European Cup where they were knocked out by Liverpool F.C. .  , In 1987–88, they made it also to the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup , eliminating Juventus , Auxerre and Budapest Honvéd . Saravakos was top scorer of the competition. , The 1990s were an even more successful period for the club, both nationally and internationally. Four Greek championships ( 1990 , 1991 , 1995 , 1996 ), 4 Greek Cups ( 1991 , 1993 , 1994 , 1995 ) and 2 Greek Super Cups (1993, 1994) were awarded to the club. , In the 1991–92 season, Panathinaikos reached also the last 8 of the European Cup and took part in the first ever European tournament to have a group stage. , In 1995–96 with Juan Ramon Rocha as coach and key players Krzysztof Warzycha , Józef Wandzik , Stratos Apostolakis , Georgios Georgiadis , Dimitris Markos , Giannis Kalitzakis , Giorgos Donis and Juan Jose Borrelli , Panathinaikos reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League eliminating FC Nantes , Porto , Aalborg and Legia Warsaw . , They faced Ajax , recording a 0–1 first leg away victory. However, they suffered a 0–3 defeat on the second leg and were thus denied entry to the final once more. , In the summer of 2000, president Giorgos Vardinogiannis resigned from his duties with complaints for the refereeing situation in Greece and passed his shares to his nephew Giannis Vardinogiannis , who changed the style of the club's management. Angelos Anastasiadis was initially appointed coach of the team and later the ex-player Giannis Kyrastas . , With the arrival of coach Sergio Markarian , Panathinaikos reached the quarter-finals of the 2001–02 UEFA Champions League , being eliminated by Barcelona . Panathinaikos had passed the first group stage as first against Arsenal F.C. , RCD Mallorca and FC Schalke 04 , and the second group stage as second against Real Madrid C.F. , FC Porto and AC Sparta Prague . , The next season (2002–03), they lost the Championship in the last two games by arch-rivals Olympiacos. In Europe, they were eliminated in the UEFA Cup quarter-finals by eventual winners Porto . They had knocked out Fenerbahçe S.K. (with an impressive 4-1 in Athens), FC Slovan Liberec and R.S.C.

They won also the Cup beating Olympiakos 3-1 in the final, making the Double . New players like Ezequiel González , Lucian Sanmartean and Markus Münch had signed the summer before. In the Champions League they came third in the group stage facing Manchester United , PSV Eindhoven and Rangers . However, Shum was unexpectedly fired early in the next season (2004–05) and Zdeněk Ščasný succeeded him on the bench. Panathinaikos finished second in the Championship, while in the Champions League they came again third in the group stage facing Rosenborg BK , VfB Stuttgart and Arsenal . They continued to UEFA Cup where they were eliminated by Sevilla FC . , In 2005, major changes were made in the team's roster. Players like Angelos Basinas and Michalis Konstantinou departed, while others like Flávio Conceição , Igor Biscan and Andreas Ivanschitz arrived. Ščasný gave his seat to Alberto Malesani . At the start of the 2006–07 season, Malesani left the team and he was replaced by Hans Backe , who left only three months after his appointment. Víctor Muñoz then came. For the 2007–08 season, Panathinaikos hired José Peseiro . , On 22 April 2008 and under pressure from the fan base, main shareholder Giannis Vardinogiannis gave a press conference in which he announced the decision of his family to reduce their share in the club to 50% – after 30 years of full ownership – through a €80 million increase of the company's capital stock. After the negotiations and the share capital increase, the Vardinogiannis family would hold 56% of the club, the amateur Club 10% and the other shareholders 34% (with main investors Andreas Vgenopoulos , Pavlos Giannakopoulos , Adamantios Polemis and Nikos Pateras ). Nikos Pateras was selected to be the new President of the club. , Following the major changes in 2008, Panathinaikos hired Henk ten Cate as coach and bought many expensive players such as Gilberto Silva from Arsenal and Gabriel from Fluminense . In the 2008–09 season, the Greens proved that they could hold their weight in the Champions League by reaching the last 16. However, they disappointed in the Greek Championship finishing 3rd in the regular season, though they managed to come 2nd overall after the playoff mini-league. , The 2009–10 season was successful for Panathinaikos. During the summer transfer period the club bought Djibril Cissé from Marseille , Kostas Katsouranis from Benfica , Sebastian Leto from Liverpool and various other players spending more than €35 million. Henk ten Cate left in December to be replaced by Nikos Nioplias . The team managed to reach the last 16 of the Europa League and win both the Greek Championship and the Greek Cup (beating Aris FC in the final). , In 2011, due to financial problems and management disagreements, Panathinaikos sold Djibril Cissé for €5,800,000 to S.S. Lazio and first-choice goalkeeper Alexandros Tzorvas to Palermo in order to reduce the budget.   New players came like Quincy Owusu-Abeyie , Toche , Vitolo and Zeca . The club also changed their president and chose Dimitris Gontikas to be the new chairman. Panathinaikos failed to qualify to the Group Stage of Champions League as they were knocked out by Odense BK (4–5 on aggregate). , Panathinaikos' downfall continued as a result of the serious riots in the Panathinaikos-Olympiacos derby of 18 March 2012. The entire board quit and Panathinaikos remained headless for about 2 months.  The owner of Skai TV , Giannis Alafouzos , however devised a plan to take Vardinogiannis' shares (54.7%) and make them available to fans around Greece so that everyone could contribute a desired amount, so that Panathinaikos could overcome the crisis.  His plan seemed to be working as a new 20-member board was elected with Dimitris Gontikas at the president's chair again,  however it was yet to be seen how the fans would respond to Panathinaikos' call for help. , On 2 July 2012, the Panathenaic Alliance finally opened to the public so that everyone could be a member and contribute a desired amount in return for privileges. After a few weeks of operation, 8.606 members had signed up, some of which were current or former Panathinaikos players (Jean-Alain Boumsong, Ninis, Gilberto Silva, Cisse and others). , 18 July 2012 marked a historical day in Panathinaikos history, as Giannis Vardinogiannis gave his shares - 54.7% of Panathinaikos F.C. - to the Panathinaikos Alliance, thereby allowing Panathinaikos to have a fresh start with their own fans at the steering wheel, who through elections (amongst the members of the Alliance) they compose the Board of Directors and elect the Club's President. First president was elected Giannis Alafouzos . , The first season with the Panathinaikos Alliance at the helm was nothing short of abysmal for the club. While still enduring financial troubles, Panathinaikos finished 6th in the championship and failed to qualify for the European competitions for the first time in 16 years. , For the 2013-14 season the membership had risen up to 9.305 members. Starting the 2013-2014 season both fans and journalists were very skeptical of Panathinaikos' chances of a successful season and a lot of people expected the team to get relegated. In May 2013 Yannis Anastasiou was appointed manager. Anastasiou planned a team based on players from the Panathinaikos Youth Academies joined by experienced foreign players looking to revive their careers. Despite the early skepticism Panathinaikos' fans supported the team through the rough start and the season turned out to be a massive success considering the dire financial situation of the club and the young and inexperienced squad. Panathinaikos finished 4th in the regular season and 2nd after the playoffs (meaning they qualified for the Champions League ), with Marcus Berg first scorer of the team. Panathinaikos also won the Greek Cup after a 4-1 win over PAOK . , 1908 , Older , Current , The colours that were first used by the team in 1908 were red and white. The first symbol of the club was a red association football ball of the era. In 1911, the colours changed to green and white. In 1918, Michalis Papazoglou proposed the shamrock as emblem of Panathinaikos, symbol of harmony and good luck.  He used to have it sewn on his shirt since he was competing for a club in his native Chalcedon , Constantinople .  Papazoglou was possibly inspired by Billy Sherring , an Irish Canadian athlete who had won the Athens 1906 Olympic marathon (1906 Intercalated Games) wearing a white outfit with a big green shamrock on the chest.    , The team's jersey colours are green and white (green for health and nature and white for virtue ), although the white sometimes is omitted, used as trim or as an alternative. During the first years after the establishment of green as Panathinaikos' primary colour, players were wearing green shirts, white shorts and green socks. During the '30s, the appearance with the characteristic horizontal strips was established. This motive was used also in the next decades as primary or second choice. Since then, the uniform style has changed many times but green has always remained the team's primary colour. , Also, during the '70s, a shade of blue was chosen as a second choice for the team. The same colour was used again as secondary since then. , First , Alternative , Panathinaikos' traditional home ground since the early 1920s is the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium , the oldest active football stadium in Greece, in the Ampelokipoi district of central Athens . The stadium is located on Alexandras Avenue and is most commonly referred to as Leoforos (i.e., Avenue). It is considered one of the most historic stadiums in Greece, as it was used by the Greek national football team as home ground for many years (most recently for the UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying matches) and even by Panathinaikos' biggest rivals, AEK and Olympiacos , on various occasions. , Panathinaikos left Leoforos in 1984 to play in the newly built Athens Olympic Stadium . In 2000, then club president Angelos Filippidis announced a return to the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium, following a €7 million renovation. Capacity was reduced from 25,000 to 16,620, new dressing rooms were built and modular stand roofing was added in compliance with UEFA requirements, but in 2004 stricter standards were announced and the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium would need further expansion were it to remain suitable for UEFA-sanctioned matches. This was precluded by local zoning regulations and the team had to return to the Olympic Stadium once more until a new stadium, the proposed Votanikos Arena , was built. The Leoforos ground was due for demolition. , On 27 January 2007, the board of Panathinaikos decided to reuse the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium for the team's 2007–08 Greek Super League and UEFA Cup home games. Also, the club officials decided to install new lawn, new seats and upgrade the press conference room and the restrooms. , As of October 2013 and due to the club's and the country's financial troubles, the construction of the Votanikos Arena has stopped and consequently the plans for the demolition of the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium have been put on hold. After another five-year spell at the Olympic Stadium, the team has returned to its traditional home ground once again. , The current President of the club, Giannis Alafouzos , declared his intension for another renovation of the stadium and the capacity increase, while the Panathinaikos Movement made its propositions for a total reconstruction. , Paiania has been the training ground of Panathinaikos since 1981. The same year the Academy of the club was reorganized, becoming one of the best in the country and feeding the first team with notable players (Karagounis, Basinas, Kyrgiakos, Ninis etc.), such as the national teams. In 2013, was decided the move of the club from the previous training center of Paiania to a new one, owned by the team. Located in the area of Koropi , Georgios Kalafatis Sports Center became the new training ground and Academy base of Panathinaikos. , Until 1979, football in Greece was still in amateur level. The team, such as the other departments of Panathinaikos A.O. , depended on the financial support of the club's members, while the President (responsible for all athletic departments) was elected by the Board members. In 1979 the Greek football turned professional and the Vardinogiannis family purchased the football department. Giorgos Vardinogiannis became the new president.  Vardinogiannis family were the owners of the club the next decades. , On 22 April 2008 and under pressure from the fan base, main shareholder Giannis Vardinogiannis gave a press conference in which he announced the decision of his family to reduce their share in the club to 50% – after 30 years of full ownership – through a €80 million increase of the company's capital stock. After the negotiations and the share capital increase, the Vardinogiannis family would hold 56% of the club, the amateur Club 10% (as before) and the new shareholders 34%. Pavlos Giannakopoulos , Nikos Pateras , Adamantios Polemis and Andreas Vgenopoulos were the main investors, plus other minor shareholders. Nikos Pateras was selected to be the new president. , In 2011, due to financial problems and management disagreements, the direction decided to reduce the budget and sell many players. In 2012, the owner of Skai TV , Giannis Alafouzos , devised a plan to take Vardinogiannis' shares (54.7%) and make them available to fans around Greece so that everyone could contribute, so that Panathinaikos could overcome the crisis.  His intension was to create a new, for the Greek athletic standards, supporter-owned football club . On 2 July 2012, the Panathenaic Alliance finally opened to the public so that everyone could be a member and contribute a desired amount in return for privileges. A few days later Giannis Vardinogiannis gave his shares - 54.7% of Panathinaikos F.C. - to the Alliance, while the other shareholders maintained their percentage. The members of the Alliance through elections compose the Board of Directors and elect the Club's President. First president was elected Giannis Alafouzos .

They have also a large fanbase in all Greek prefectures (central Greece, Peloponnese, Epirus, Thessaly, Aegean islands, Macedonia and Crete), in Cyprus and in the Greek diaspora . Their main rivals are Olympiacos (29%), while AEK and PAOK share 11-12% of the fans. They have the largest fanbase among high educated people and the Greek upper class, while they are popular among middle and lower class also. , Panathinaikos supporters hold both records of the most season tickets sales (31.091 in 2010) and highest average attendance for a unique season (44.942 in 1985-86 season) in the history of Greek football. , The main organized supporters of Panathinaikos are known as Gate 13 (est. 1966), the oldest fan association in Greece, which consists of around 80 clubs alongside Greece and Cyprus.  Gate 13 style of supporting includes the use of green fireworks, large and small green flags, displaying of banners and especially the creation of colorful and large choreographies, noisy and constant cheering and other supporters stuff.
