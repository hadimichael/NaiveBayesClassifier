( German pronunciation: [ˈʔaɪ̯ntʁaxt ˈfʁaŋkfʊɐt] ) is a German sports club , based in Frankfurt , that is best known for its association football club , currently playing in the Bundesliga , the top tier of the German football league system . , The club was founded in 1899, and have won one German championship , four DFB-Pokals , and one UEFA Cup . Since 1925, their stadium is the Waldstadion, which since 1 July 2005, is called Commerzbank-Arena for sponsorship reasons. , , , The origins of the side go back to a pair of football clubs founded in 1899: Frankfurter Fußball-Club Viktoria von 1899 – regarded as the \"original\" football side in the club's history – and Frankfurter Fußball-Club Kickers von 1899 . Both clubs were founding members of the new Nordkreis-Liga in 1909. These two teams merged in May 1911 to become Frankfurter Fußball Verein (Kickers-Viktoria) , an instant success, taking three league titles from 1912 to 1914 in the Nordkreis-Liga and qualifying for the Southern German championship in each of those seasons. In turn, Frankfurter FV joined the gymnastics club Frankfurter Turngemeinde von 1861 to form TuS Eintracht Frankfurt von 1861 in 1920. (The German word Eintracht means 'harmony, concord,' and Eintracht X is the equivalent of English X United in the names of sports teams.  ) , At the time, sports in Germany was dominated by nationalistic gymnastics organizations, and under pressure from that sport's governing authority, the gymnasts and footballers went their separate ways again in 1927, as Turngemeinde Eintracht Frankfurt von 1861 and Sportgemeinde Eintracht Frankfurt (FFV) von 1899 . , Through the late 1920s and into the 1930s Eintracht won a handful of local and regional championships, first in the Kreisliga Nordmain , then in the Bezirksliga Main , and Bezirksliga Main-Hessen . After being eliminated from the national level playoffs after quarterfinal losses in 1930 and 1931, they won their way to the final in 1932 where they were beaten 0–2 by Bayern Munich who claimed their first ever German championship. In 1933, German football was re-organized into sixteen Gauligen under the Third Reich and the club played first division football in the Gauliga Südwest , consistently finishing in the upper half of the table and winning their division in 1938. , They picked up where they left off after World War II, playing as a solid side in the first division Oberliga Süd and capturing division titles in 1953 and 1959. Their biggest success came on the heels of that second divisional title as they went on to a 5–3 victory over local rivals Kickers Offenbach to take the 1959 German national title and followed up immediately with an outstanding run in the 1960 European Cup. Eintracht Frankfurt lost 3–7 to Real Madrid in an exciting final widely regarded as one of the best football matches ever played,  which included a hat-trick by Alfredo Di Stéfano . , , The side continued to play good football and earned themselves a place as one of the original sixteen teams selected to play in the Bundesliga , Germany's new professional football league, formed in 1963 . Eintracht played Bundesliga football for thirty-three seasons finishing in the top half of the table more often than not. Their best Bundesliga performances were five third-place finishes: they ended just two points back of champion VfB Stuttgart in 1991–1992 . , They also narrowly avoided relegation on several occasions. In 1984 , they defeated MSV Duisburg 6–1 on aggregate, and in 1989 they beat 1. FC Saarbrücken 4–1 on aggregate, in two-game playoffs. Eintracht finally slipped and were relegated to 2.Bundesliga for the 1996–97 season. At the time that they were sent down along with 1. FC Kaiserslautern , these teams were two of only four sides that had been in the Bundesliga since the league's inaugural season. , It looked as though they would be out again in 1998–1999 , but they pulled through by beating defending champions Kaiserslautern 5–1, while Nuremberg unexpectedly lost at home, to give Eintracht the break they needed to stay up. The following year, in another struggle to avoid relegation, the club was \"fined\" two points by the DFB (Deutscher Fußball-Bund or German Football Association) for financial misdeeds, but pulled through with a win by a late goal over SSV Ulm on the last day of the season. The club was plagued by financial difficulties again in 2004 before once more being relegated. , Between 1997 and 2005, Eintracht has bounced between the top two divisions. , The 2010–11 season ended with the club's fourth Bundesliga relegation. After setting a new record for most points in the first half of the season the club struggled after the winter. After seven games without scoring a goal, coach Skibbe was doubted. Despite winning the next game Skibbe was sacked and Christoph Daum took over his place.  The change wasn't successful however, Eintracht only achieved three draws out of the last seven games and got relegated on the 34th match day.  , One year later Eintracht Frankfurt beat Alemannia Aachen 3–0 on the 32nd match day of the season 2011–12 and qualified again for the Bundesliga.  , In 2014–15 Eintracht had the 16th highest attendance in Europe, ahead of such prominent clubs as Celtic , Inter and Paris Saint-Germain . , The club has enjoyed considerable success in competition outside the Bundesliga. Eintracht famously lost the European Cup final to Real Madrid on 18 May 1960 at Hampden Park 7–3 in front of 127,621 spectators. It is one of the most talked about European matches of all time, with Di Stéfano scoring 3 and Puskás scoring the other 4 for Real. , In 1967 they won the Intertoto Cup beating Inter Bratislava in the final. , They won the German Cup in 1974 , 1975 , 1981 , and 1988 , and took the UEFA Cup over another German team – Borussia Mönchengladbach – in 1980 . More recently, Eintracht were the losing finalists in the 2006 German Cup. Their opponents in the final, Bayern Munich , Bundesliga champions that year, qualified to participate in the Champions League . As a result Eintracht received the Cup winner's place in the UEFA Cup where they advanced to the group stage. , The club crest derives from the coat of arms of Frankfurt am Main which is a reference to the one-headed imperial eagle of the 13th century. , The crest has evolved slowly over time, showing little significant change until 1980 when a stylized eagle in black and white was chosen to represent the team. In the centennial year 1999 the club board decided to re-adopt a more traditional eagle crest. Since 2006 Eintracht has had a living mascot, the golden eagle Attila from the nearby Hanau Zoo, who is very popular among supporters. , The official club colours of red, black, and white have their origins in the colours of the founding clubs Frankfurter FC Viktoria and Frankfurter FC Kickers , which sported red and white and black and white respectively. Red and white are the colours of the city coat of arms, and black and white the colours of Prussia . When the clubs merged, officials decided to adopt the colours of both sides. Since local rival Kickers Offenbach sport the colours red and white, Eintracht avoids playing in such a kit, preferring to play in black and red, or in black and white. , The club is nicknamed Die Adler (The Eagles), which obviously derives from their crest. A nickname still popular among supporters is SGE , taken from the club's old official name S port g emeinde E intracht (Frankfurt), roughly translated meaning Sports community United . , The nickname Launische Diva (Moody Diva) was heard most often in the early 1990s when the club would easily defeat top teams only to surprisingly lose to lesser clubs. This nickname was also held to refer to the what was regarded as the dubious work of some club chairmen, including for example, the failure to record the transfer fee of Hungarian star player Lajos Détári on club books. The current reign of Heribert Bruchhagen appears to have left these practises to the past. , (+ as Frankfurter FV) , Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules .

The facility was renovated for the FIFA World Cup 2006 in Germany. For Bundesliga fixtures the maximum capacity is 51,500 as on the East Stand next to the visitor's terrace some spaces are held free for security purposes. , Though the media usually refer to the ground by the official name, Commerzbank-Arena, the Eintracht faithful stick with the name Waldstadion . ,  , Eintracht Frankfurt U23 was the reserve team of Eintracht Frankfurt. The team played as U23 (Under 23) to emphasize the character of the team as a link between youth academy and pro team and competed until 2013–14 in the regular league system in the 4th tier, the Regionalliga Süd , until the club board decided to dissolve the team. , The 2011–12 season saw Eintracht play local rival FSV Frankfurt in a league match for the first time in almost 50 years. The last league game between the two had been played on 27 January 1962, then in the Oberliga Süd . For the first of the two matches, FSV's home game on 21 August 2011, the decision was made to move to Eintracht's stadium as FSV's Bornheimer Hang only holds less than 11,000 spectators.  Eintracht won 0–4. The second match on 18 February 2012 ended in another victory for Eintracht, a 6–1 rout. , The sports club Eintracht Frankfurt e.V. is made up of sixteen sections: , The most famous athlete of Eintracht Frankfurt is Betty Heidler , the hammer thrower world champion of 2007 .
