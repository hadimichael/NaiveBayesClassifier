It is the most successful club in Serbia and forms a major part of the Partizan Sports Association .  The club plays in the Serbian SuperLiga and has spent its entire history in the top tier of Yugoslav and Serbian football having won a total of thirty-nine trophies, including a record of twenty-six national championships, twelve national cups, one national super-cup as well as one Mitropa Cup ,  and finished in the Yugoslav league all-time table as 2nd.  , Partizan was founded by young high officers of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) in 1945 in Belgrade, as part of the Yugoslav Sports Association Partizan.  Their home ground is the Partizan Stadium in Belgrade, where they have played since 1949.  Partizan holds records such as playing in the first European Champions Cup match in 1955 ,  as well as becoming the first Balkan and Eastern European football club to reach the European Champions Cup final, when it did so in 1966 .  Partizan is the only Serbian club to make it to the UEFA Champions League group stage. , The club has a long-standing rivalry with Red Star Belgrade . Matches between these two clubs are known as the eternal derby and rate as one of the greatest cross-town clashes in the world.  In September 2009, the British newspaper Daily Mail ranked the Red Star-Partizan derby 4th among the ten greatest football rivalries of all time.  FK Partizan is the second-most popular football club in Serbia.  The club is also very popular in Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina , especially in the Bosnian Serb entity of Republika Srpska .  Partizan also have many supporters in all the other former- Yugoslav republics and in the Serbian and Yugoslav diasporas.  , , , Most of us, young generals who played and loved football, we gathered and agreed to start a football club. We did not argue over what the name would be. We were Partisans , it was most natural to call our club Partizan. , FK Partizan was founded on 4 October 1945, as a football section of the Yugoslav Sports Association Partizan .  It was named in honor of the Yugoslav Partisans , the Communist military formation that fought during World War II .  The club was formed and initially managed by a group of high officers of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA),  notably Svetozar Vukmanović , Peko Dapčević , Ratko Vujović and Koča Popović .  In 1946, Partizan joined the newly formed Yugoslav First League and Cup . The club had a successful start, winning the double in their debut season .  A second championship title followed in 1949 .  Until then, Partizan played its home games on the old BSK stadium, when its own stadium was built on the same site and named JNA Stadium .  In 1950, the club evolved from a football section of the Army into an independent club under the umbrella organization JSD Partizan.  The club's first president became Ratko Vujović .  In 1953, the remaining formal connections between Partizan and the JNA finally ceased.  During the 1950s, the club had a long break without winning a championship, winning only cup titles in 1952, 1954 and 1957 .  On 4 September 1955, Partizan participated in the first-ever Champions Cup match, playing against Portuguese club Sporting Clube de Portugal in Lisbon.  , After twelve years of playing in blue-red kits, the club adopted the black-white colors in 1957.   This change of the club's image and appearance was followed by changes in its squad. The number of young players, products of Partizan's youth school, soon emerged into one of the best generations of footballers that Partizan ever had.  Managers Illés Spitz , Virgil Popescu , Florijan Matekalo and Stjepan Bobek monitored and guided their development. The decision to rely mostly on talented youngsters scouted from all over the country quickly produced results as Partizan captured three consecutive championship titles, in 1961 ,  1962 and 1963 ,   capturing the first title hat-trick in the history of the Yugoslav First League.  In 1965 , the team won its fourth league title in five years,  with its only loss in title races being in 1964 , when the league was won by Red Star Belgrade, whom Partizan developed a rivalry with in the 1960s.  The 1965–66 European Cup campaign was the crown of this generation's achievements.  After defeating English side Manchester United 2–1 on aggregate, FK Partizan, led by manager Abdulah Gegić , achieved the greatest success in the history of the club by playing in the 1966 European Cup Final against Real Madrid from Spain.  By participating in this match, Partizan became the first club from the Balkans and Eastern Europe to reach a European Cup final.  The match was played on 11 May 1966 in the Heysel Stadium in Brussels.  Partizan led by one goal until the 70th minute, but lost to the Spaniards 2–1 in the end.  After the finals, Partizan fell into a crisis that lasted for several years.  , In 1976, Partizan won its seventh championship trophy, after a decade-long hiatus.  An eighth title followed in 1978 .  That same year, led by manager Ante Mladinić , Partizan won its first European trophy, the Mitropa Cup , defeating Hungarian side FC Honvéd in the finals with a score of 1–0.  The next season turned out to be the worst in Partizan's history, with the club finishing 15th in the league, barely avoiding relegation with a 4–2 victory against Budućnost Podgorica in its last fixture.  Subsequently, in the 1979–80 season , Partizan finished 13th in the league.  In the following two seasons, Partizan progressed on the table by finishing in 8th and 6th place.   , Partizan became Yugoslav league-champion in 1983 ,  in large part due to the performances of the young Dragan Mance .  He helped Partizan win the league by scoring 15 goals, and immediately became a fan favourite.  He also led the club in their 1984–85 UEFA Cup second round tie against Queens Park Rangers . The English club won the first leg 6–2, but Partizan advanced after a 4–0 return victory.  A goal which Mance scored against in that fixture is considered to be one of the most remarkable goals in the history of FK Partizan.  That match in which Mance scored was voted 70th of the 100 greatest matches in the history of football, in a poll organized by Eurosport in 2009.  On 3 September 1985, Mance died in an automobile accident on the Novi Sad-Belgrade highway . He was only 22 years old, and at the peak of his popularity.  Even today, Mance is considered to be the one of the greatest players to have ever played for Partizan by the fans of the club.  In his honour, the street next to Partizan's stadium in Belgrade carries his name.  , In 1986 , Partizan won its 10th championship title with a 4–0 win over Željezničar , due to a better goal difference than second-placed rivals Red Star Belgrade.  However, the Football Association of Yugoslavia ruled that the entire last round of fixtures had to be replayed after accusations that certain results had been fixed. Partizan refused to replay its match, after which the game was awarded 3–0 to Željezničar, and the title was given to Red Star Belgrade. After a sequence of appeals and lawsuits which eventually led to the Yugoslav Constitutional Court, the original final table of the 1985–86 season, with Partizan as champions, was officially recognized in 1987. Also, the points deduction from 1986–87 season was annulled, and the title was given to Partizan, who headed the table without the deduction.  , During Yugoslavia's final years, Partizan underwent significant organizational changes. In 1989, former goalkeeper Ivan Ćurković became club president while Mirko Marjanović became the president of Partizan's executive board.  The club only won the 1989 national cup , 32 years after its last victory in that competition.  The last trophy which the club won before the breakup of Yugoslavia was the 1989 Yugoslav Super Cup, the first and the only one that was organized.  , After the collapse of Yugoslavia, Partizan won two titles in a row, in 1993 and 1994 .   Next three championships, Partizan won in 1996 , 1997 and 1999 .    The club also won three national cups in 1992, 1994 and 1998.  The key man for all these trophies was manager Ljubiša Tumbaković , who became the most successful manager in the history of the club.  Tumbaković guided Partizan to another cup win in 2001,  and the championship trophy in 2002 .  His successor, Lothar Matthäus ,  led the club to its first UEFA Champions League participation after eliminating Newcastle United in qualification,  and the championship victory in 2003 .  However, playing in Europe reflected in the championship race and Partizan lost the title.  New coach Vladimir Vermezović won the championship in 2005 , and managed to take the team to the round-of-16 of the 2004–05 UEFA Cup .  Later on, Partizan was eliminated by CSKA Moscow , the eventual winners of the competition.  Next season, after being eliminated early from European competition, Vermezović resigned in October 2005.  , Three years after Matthäus, Partizan signed another German coach, Jürgen Röber .  He left the club after a few months due to poor results in domestic competitions. Afterwards, the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro separated, and the newly founded Serbian SuperLiga was established in August 2006.  The club appointed Miodrag Ješić for the second time.  Under him, Partizan finished 2nd in the SuperLiga and managed to qualify for the 2006–07 UEFA Cup group stage.  Later on Ješić was sacked and replaced by Miroslav Đukić .  , In January 2008, former Partizan player Slaviša Jokanović was appointed as the club's new head coach.  In the 2007–08 season, Jokanović has won the championship and cup.  The next year, Partizan defended their double from the 2008 for the first time in the club's history.   In Europe, UEFA expelled Partizan from the UEFA Cup due to crowd trouble at their away qualifying match in Mostar .  In the next two seasons, after relegations from the Champions League, Partizan qualified two times in a row for the second-most prestigious European club football tournament. The club played in the 2008–09 UEFA Cup and 2009–10 UEFA Europa League .   , Under new manager Aleksandar Stanojević ,  Partizan won the championship in 2010 and the double in 2011 .   In UEFA competitions, Partizan qualified for the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League after beating Belgian side RSC Anderlecht .  In the following season, Partizan failed to qualify neither for Champions League nor Europa League and after the half-season, Stanojević was released.  Partizan then signed former Chelsea manager Avram Grant ,  who won a fifth consecutive league title.  Grant resigned after five months and former Partizan manager Vladimir Vermezović returned to Belgrade in May 2012.  Under his guidance, Partizan qualified for the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League group stage.  Because of poor results in the second part of national championship, Vermezović was dismissed and replaced by Vuk Rašović .  Following the victory in the eternal derby and in pre-last round, Rašović secured a sixth consecutive title, a total of 25th in history of the club.  As a champion of the Serbian SuperLiga for 2012–13 season, Partizan managed to equalize a national record by the number of championship titles won.  , In October 1945, Partizan adopted as their first crest a blue circle with a yellow bordered red five-pointed star in the middle, which symbolized communism ,  and contained the abbreviation JA ( Jugoslovenska Armija , The Yugoslav Army) inside it. Later on, the central circle became white with a red five-pointed star in it. It was surrounded by a larger blue circle in which the words \"the Yugoslav Army\" were written, while both circles were bordered by a yellow circle with a green wreath over it. At the bottom of the emblem was a shield with red and white lines, and on the top were five torches, each representing one of the five nations of Yugoslavia ( Serbs , Croats , Slovenes , Macedonians and Montenegrins ). This was a clear reference to the National Emblem of Yugoslavia .  , In the early 1950s, Partizan was separated from the Yugoslav Army and for the first time the team's name was written in the Cyrillic and Latin alphabets. The inscription of the Yugoslav Army was removed from the crest, along with the green wreath, and was replaced by the words Sportsko Društvo ( Sports association ). Partizan used this emblem until 1958, although it changed its equipment colors of blue and red to black and white a year before. The crest was also changed to be completely black and white, and Sportsko Društvo was amended into Jugoslovensko Sportsko Društvo (Yugoslav Sports Association), while the five red torches and the five-pointed star remained.  It was slightly redesigned after 1963 by adding a sixth torch to reflect the change of the official state emblem, which now included six torches representing six Yugoslav republics,  instead of the previous five representing the nations. The crest remained unchanged until the breakup of Yugoslavia . , When Yugoslavia ceased to exist in 1992, instead of Jugoslovensko Sportsko Društvo , the word Fudbalski klub ( Football Club ) were inserted and this crest was left to this day. The author of the crest was academic painter Branko Šotra.  In the 2007–08 season , Partizan won its 20th national championship and added two stars above their crest, symbolizing the twenty gained titles.   However, there is an alternative crest, which Partizan supporters call the \"shovel\" but it is never used in official matches.  , I'm responsible because Partizan adopted black and white colors. I suggested change of shirts on behalf of the whole team, to club's general secretary Artur Takač . It all happened while we were on tour in South America, and when we played a friendly match against Juventus in 1957. We got as gift two sets of their jerseys, as they were delighted with our game. All the players were thrilled with the quality and color of the new uniforms, and they asked me to wear them all the time, which happened at the end, and Partizan's colors has remained black and white to this day. , For most of its history, Partizan has played in black and white striped jerseys, but during its earliest days it used entirely dark red , blue or white jerseys.  In 1950, Partizan briefly had an all-white shirt with a blue diagonal stripe, besides an all blue shirt.  From 1952, the first red-blue striped and quartered jerseys appeared.  In 1957, the club was on tour in South America and after a friendly game with Juventus F.C. , a president of the Italian club Umberto Agnelli , donated them a two sets of black and white jerseys.  Since then, Partizan has played mainly in black and white striped shirts,  with black or white shorts and socks.  But there were exceptions, like in 1974, when they wore a black and white hooped shirt, and 1982, when they have played in a plain white jerseys with a thick black stripe across them.  In 1990 , the red and blue jersey returned after more than 30 years, in an away match against Hibernians F.C. during the UEFA Cup campaign. All this time, the away shirts have been mostly either all white or occasionally red-blue striped, but in recent years an all-black strip is usually used.  , The stadium's name is Partizan Stadium, although it was known as \"JNA Stadium\" ( Stadion Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija , Stadium of the Yugoslav People's Army ) for most of its history, and even today, a lot of football fans in all countries of the former-Yugoslavia call it by its old name. Partizan supporters sometimes call it \"Fudbalski Hram\" (The Temple of Football).  , The stadium is situated in the Savski venac municipality, in central Belgrade. Designed by architect Mika Janković, the ground was built on the site of BSK Stadium .  It was officially opened on Day of Yugoslav People's Army on 22 December 1951.  The first match ever played was between Yugoslavia and France on 9 October 1949.  The stadium had a capacity of 55,000 until it was renovated in 1998 following UEFA security regulations.  This led to the conversion of the stadium into an all-seater reducing the capacity to 32,710,  currently the second largest stadium in Serbia, behind the Red Star Stadium .  , The ground has also been used for a variety of other sport events since 1949. It was used from the mid-fifties until 1987 as the final point of yearly festivities called the Youth Day .  Also, it was the host of the 1962 European Athletics Championships , a place for various concerts and it hosted many times the Yugoslav Cup and Serbian Cup final.   , The Partizan youth school , called Youth School Belin – Lazarević – Nadoveza , was founded in the 1950s and named after former Partizan players Bruno Belin , Čedomir Lazarević and Branko Nadoveza.  The club is well known for its dedicated work with youngsters.  Its training philosophy is not only the development of football players, but also to care of their growth and personality forming, while also teaching the sporting spirit.  There are around 400 youngsters classified by age categories.  There are six age groups, four compete at the level of the Football Association of Serbia , the U17, U16, U15 and U14, while the U13 and U12 compete at the level of the Football Association of Belgrade.  Below U12 level there are no official competitions, but players do play in tournaments and friendly matches.  , Partizan is the club with the most league titles and cup wins in youth competition in Serbia.  The youth teams also participate in numerous tournaments around Europe and also organize an U17 international tournament with participation of some of the top European clubs.  Partizan also organizes football camps for children in Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina , Slovenia , Australia   and the United States.   Many of the best youth-academy players move directly to the Partizan senior side, or to the affiliate club Teleoptik Zemun .  , All of Partizan's youth categories train at the Partizan sports complex named SC Partizan-Teleoptik , along with Partizan's seniors and the players of Teleoptik.  Partizan has won several awards for its youth work, including \"Best European Youth Work\" in 2006,  and the club's youth school has been declared the second-best in Europe after that of Ajax Amsterdam .  Partizan's academy has produced numerous professional football players or Yugoslav and Serbian internationals. Notable players from the recent past include: Miralem Sulejmani , Stevan Jovetić , Adem Ljajić , Matija Nastasić , Lazar Marković , Miloš Jojić , Zoran Tošić and Aleksandar Mitrović . , According to a 2008 domestic poll, Partizan is the second-most popular football club in Serbia, behind Red Star Belgrade.  The club has a large fanbase in Montenegro,  Bosnia and Herzegovina (especially in the Bosnian Serb entity of Republika Srpska ),  and Croatia . They also have many supporters in all other former-Yugoslav republics like Macedonia ,  Slovenia ,  and among the Serbian diaspora , especially in Germany,  Austria ,  Switzerland ,  Sweden ,  Canada, the United States and Australia. , The organized supporters of Partizan are called Grobari (The Gravediggers or Undertakers ),  which were formed in 1970 and situated mainly on the south stand of the Partizan Stadium; therefore they are also known as Grobari Jug ( The Undertakers South ).  Even some ordinary Partizan fans often refer to themselves as \"Grobari.\" The nickname itself was given by their sporting rivals Delije of Red Star Belgrade, referring to the club's mostly black colors which were similar to the official uniforms of cemetery undertakers.  The other theory is that the name comes from a misinterpretation of the name of the street on which Partizan's stadium is located – Humska ( humka roughly translates as grave or entombment ),  when actually the street was named after Serbian medieval land of Hum , nowadays part of Herzegovina and South Dalmatia . The Grobari support all clubs in the Partizan Sports Association and in the course of time they have become recognizable by their noisy and constant cheering as well as their devotion and loyalty to the club.  The basis of their cheering is referred in the Serbian fan scene as the principle of \"srce, ruke, glas\" (heart, hands, voice) or \"glas i dlan\" (voice and palms),  along with songs in distinctive style.  The Grobari as a whole maintain a close friendship with the organized supporters of PAOK Thessaloniki , Steaua București , CSKA Sofia and CSKA Moscow ,   which started originally because of the two supporters' common Orthodox faith and similar founding backgrounds. It has been suggested that 'Many ultras took part in the armed conflicts and carry their scars today, translating the tribal nature of the Yugoslav wars to their clubs and ultras groups.'  , Partizan's biggest rivalry is with Red Star Belgrade .  The matches between these rivals have been labeled as the Eternal derby ( Serbian : Вечити дерби, Večiti derbi) or Belgrade derby.  The rivalry started immediately after the creation of the two clubs. Red Star was founded for Yugoslav youth and Partizan as the football section of the Yugoslav People's Army.  The rivalry is also intensified by the fact that both clubs have their stadiums situated only a few hundred meters apart.  The Eternal derby is particularly noted for the passion of both supporters groups. The stands of both teams feature fireworks, coloured confetti, flags, rolls of paper, torches, smoke, drums, giant posters and choreographies, used to create visual grandeur and apply psychological pressure on the visiting teams, hence the slogan, \"Welcome to Hellgrade\".  Some fans use sometimes also trumpets, similar to the supporters in South America. This creates for the region a typical and distinctive Balkan Brass Band atmosphere. Both sets of supporters sing passionate songs against their rivals, and the stadiums are known to bounce with the simultaneous jumping of the fans. The duel is regarded by Bleacher Report as one of the greatest football rivalries in the world.  Along with the Old Firm , the Rome derby and the Istanbul derby , the Belgrade derby is known as one of the most intense rivalries in European football.  In 2009, the Daily Mail ranked the Eternal Derby 4th among the 10 greatest football rivalries of all time.  The largest attendance at a derby match was about 100,000 spectators (90,142 with paid tickets) on 7 November 1976 at the Red Star Stadium .  The biggest win was 7–1 for Partizan on 6 December 1953 at the Partizan Stadium   but the club with the most victories is Red Star Belgrade . , Overall, Partizan have won 40 official titles including 26 national championships, 12 national cups, 1 national super cup and 1 Mitropa Cup .  , The club has earned the honour of being allowed to wear two Golden Stars for Sport Excellence on its shirts representing its league victories, the tenth of which was achieved during the 1985–86 season and the twentieth in the 2007–08 season.  , National Championships – 26 , National Cups – 12 , Yugoslav Supercup – 1 , Other Tournaments , Partizan's record-holder by number of appearances is player Momčilo Vukotić . He played 791 games in two turns, from 1968 and 1978 and from 1979 and 1984.  The goal-scoring record-holder is striker Stjepan Bobek , with 425 goals.  Over 150 footballers from Partizan have played for the Yugoslav and Serbian national football teams .  Former Partizan player Savo Milošević played 102 matches for the Yugoslav and Serbia national football team, a national record shared with Dejan Stanković .  Stjepan Bobek held the Yugoslavian national team record with 38 goals,  with second place being shared by Savo Milošević and Milan Galić , who scored 37 goals each.  , FK Partizan are record-holders of the Yugoslav First League in terms of points acquired during a campaign, with 107, and are the only league-winning team to have gone undefeated during one season (in 2005 and 2010 ). Partizan became the first champion of Yugoslavia in 1947 , the first Yugoslav Cup winner, also in 1947, and therefore also the first double winner in the country. They won three consecutive championship titles, in 1961, 1962 and 1963, the first title hat-trick in the history of the Yugoslav First League.  Partizan won the most national championships since the dissolution of Yugoslavia, being a champion thirteen times. They are the only Serbian club ever, since the first nationwide domestic football competition in 1923 , to win six consecutive national titles, not leaving the throne since the 2007–08 season .  , The club holds records such as playing in the first European Champions Cup match in 1955 ,  becoming the first Balkan and Eastern European club to play in the European Champions Cup final in 1966 ,  and becoming the first club from Serbia to take part in the UEFA Champions League group stages in 2003 .  The club's greatest victory in European competitions was 8–0 against Welsh champions F.C. Rhyl in qualifying for the 2009–10 UEFA Champions League .  , Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules .
