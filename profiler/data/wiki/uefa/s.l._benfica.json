The club is best known for its professional football team which plays in the Primeira Liga , the top tier of the Portuguese football league system , where they are back-to-back champions.  , Founded in 1904 as Sport Lisboa by a group of people led by Cosme Damião , Benfica is one of the Big Three clubs in Portugal ( Os Três Grandes ), along with its long-standing rivals Sporting CP and FC Porto – all three clubs have never been relegated from the Portuguese league since its establishment in 1934.   , Benfica is the most supported Portuguese club, the European club with the biggest percentage of supporters in its own country,   and the biggest club in the world in membership terms.   Its motto is \" E pluribus unum \" (Out of many, one) and the official anthem is \" Ser Benfiquista \".  The club colours are red and white, the team is nicknamed Águias (Eagles) or Encarnados (Reds), and their supporters are called Benfiquistas . Their home matches have been played at the Estádio da Luz since 2003, which replaced the previous 49-year-old ground .  , Benfica is the most successful Portuguese club in terms of domestic titles (73) and overall titles (75 ,  or 76 including the Latin Cup ),   being the only club to have won all Portuguese competitions. They have won a record 34 Primeira Liga titles, a record 25 Taça de Portugal (a record 10 doubles ), a record 6 Taça da Liga , 5 Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira and 3 Campeonato de Portugal . Internationally, Benfica won two consecutive European Cup titles in 1961 and 1962 , a unique feat in Portuguese football . In addition, they were runners-up at the Intercontinental Cup in 1961 and 1962 , at the European Cup in 1963 , 1965 , 1968 , 1988 and 1990 , and at the UEFA Cup/Europa League in 1983 , 2013 and 2014 . Benfica have reached 10 European finals, which ranks seventh all-time among UEFA clubs and is a Portuguese record.  , In 2000, Benfica was ranked twelfth in FIFA Club of the Century award.  In 2009, it was ranked ninth in \"Europe's Club of the Century\" by IFFHS .  As of 2015 [update] , Benfica is ranked sixth in the UEFA club coefficient rankings  and twelfth in the IFFHS World Club Ranking ,  which are the best positions of a Portuguese club.   , , , On 28 February 1904, a group of former students from the Real Casa Pia de Lisboa and members of Associação do Bem met at the back of Farmácia Franco on Rua de Belém with the goal of forming a social and cultural football club which would be called Sport Lisboa . There were a total of 24 people who attended the meeting, including the eighteen-year-old co-founder and future soul of the club, Cosme Damião . During the meeting, José Rosa Rodrigues was appointed as club president , along with Daniel Brito as secretary and Manuel Gourlade as treasurer. In this meeting it was defined that the club colours would be red (for bravery) and white (for peace), and that the crest would be composed of an eagle (symbolising high aspirations), the motto \" E pluribus unum \" (defining union between all club members), and a football ball .     , On 1 January 1905, they played their first match ever, winning 1–0 against Campo de Ourique. Despite important victories in the first few years, the club suffered due to poor operating conditions, namely the football dirt field Terras do Desembargador .  As a result, in 1907, eight players joined Sporting CP , located across the city. This event started the rivalry between the clubs. , On 13 September 1908, Sport Lisboa acquired Grupo Sport Benfica (founded on 26 July 1906 and renamed Sport Clube de Benfica in March 1908) by mutual agreement and changed its name to Sport Lisboa e Benfica . Despite the club merger, they continued their respective club operations. For Sport Lisboa they maintained the football team, the red and white shirt colours, the eagle as the symbol, and \"E pluribus unum\" as the motto. For Grupo Sport Benfica they maintained the field Campo da Feiteira ,  the main directors and the club's house. Both clubs determined that the foundation date should coincide with Sport Lisboa's (1904) given that it was the most recognised club and quite popular in Lisbon due to its football merits. In regard to the crest, a cycling wheel was added to Sport Lisboa's to represent the most important sport of Grupo Sport Benfica. Furthermore, the two entities of the new club had simultaneous members who helped to stabilise operations, which later increased the success of the merger. However, problems with the club's rented field remained. In 1913, Benfica moved to their first football grass field, Campo de Sete Rios . Four years later they moved to Campo de Benfica due to a high rent. In 1925, they moved to their own stadium, Estádio das Amoreiras ,  and this was the place where Benfica won their first national titles. , The Portuguese league began in 1934, and after finishing third in the first edition, Benfica won the next three championships in a row ( 1935–36 , 1936–37 , 1937–38 ). In 1940, Benfica won their first Taça de Portugal . In 1941, Benfica moved to Estádio do Campo Grande .  Throughout the 1940s, Benfica won three Primeira Liga ( 1941–42 , 1942–43 , 1944–45 ) and four Taça de Portugal ( 1940 , 1943 , 1944 , 1949 ). János Biri achieved the first double for the club in 1943. , Benfica's first international success happened in 1950 when they won the Latin Cup (the only Portuguese club to do so), defeating Bordeaux at the Estádio Nacional in Lisbon, with Ted Smith as manager.  They reached another final of the competition in 1957 but lost to Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu . , With Joaquim Ferreira Bogalho elected as president in 1952 and the arrival of manager Otto Glória in 1954,  Benfica became more modernised and professional, and moved into the original Estádio da Luz with an initial capacity of 40,000 spectators; later expanded to 70,000 in 1960.   , During the 1950s, Benfica won three Primeira Liga ( 1949–50 , 1954–55 , 1956–57 – they were champions in 1955 but Sporting CP played the 1955–56 European Cup instead) and six Taça de Portugal ( 1951 , 1952 , 1953 , 1955 , 1957 , 1959 ), achieving the second double in 1955 and the third one in 1957. In addition to these successes, Benfica was able to end the decade with the basic foundations in place, enabling the club to enter the 1960s as one of the best in European football . , Led by manager Béla Guttmann ,  Benfica was one of two teams, along with Barcelona , to break Real Madrid's dominance in European Champion Clubs' Cup by winning two consecutive European Cup, the first against Barcelona in 1961 (3–2) at the Wankdorf Stadium  and the second one against Real Madrid in 1962 (5–3) at the Olympic Stadium .  , Later on, Benfica reached another three European Cup finals but lost them to Milan in 1963 (2–1) at the Wembley Stadium , to Internazionale in 1965 (1–0) at the San Siro , and to Manchester United in 1968 (4–1) again at the Wembley Stadium. In 1968, Benfica was elected the European Team of the Year by France Football . , The 1960s were the best period of the club, in which Benfica won eight Primeira Liga ( 1959–60 , 1960–61 , 1962–63 , 1963–64 , 1964–65 , 1966–67 , 1967–68 , 1968–69 ), three Taça de Portugal ( 1962 , 1964 , 1969 ) and two European Cup ( 1960–61 , 1961–62 ). Their fourth domestic double was achieved in 1964 with Lajos Czeizler and the fifth one in 1969 with Otto Glória. , Many of their successes in this decade were achieved with Eusébio – the only player to have won a Ballon d'Or for a Portuguese club – Coluna , José Águas , José Augusto , Simões , Torres , and other notable players , who formed the team of 1963–64, which set a club record of 103 goals in 26 league matches.  During its golden decade, Benfica was ranked first in European football three times. , During the 1970s, they faded slightly from the European scene, but remained as the main force of Portuguese football , winning six Primeira Liga ( 1970–71 , 1971–72 , 1972–73 , 1974–75 , 1975–76 , 1976–77 ) and two Taça de Portugal ( 1970 , 1972 ). Jimmy Hagan led the club to three Primeira Liga and one Taça de Portugal between 1970 and 1973, achieving the club's sixth double in 1972. Benfica attracted Europe-wide attention when they reached the semi-finals of the European Cup, where they were eliminated on aggregate (1–0) by Ajax of Johan Cruyff . , In 1972–73, Benfica became the first club in Portugal to last a whole season without defeat, winning 28 matches – 23 consecutively – out of 30, and drawing 2. In that year, Eusébio became Europe's top scorer with 40 goals, in what was his penultimate season as a Benfica player. They scored 101 goals, breaking the 100 goals mark for the second time in the club's history, and conceded 13 goals. , In the late 1970s, early 1980s, the club had some corporate management problems but the team managed to keep up to their high standards. In 1981, Lajos Baróti secured the seventh double for Benfica by winning the Primeira Liga and the Taça de Portugal . Later, under the guidance of Sven-Göran Eriksson , the club won two consecutive Primeira Liga ( 1982–83 , 1983–84 ) and one Taça de Portugal ( 1983 ), achieving their eighth double, and reached the final of the UEFA Cup in 1983 but lost on aggregate score to Anderlecht . In the same year, Benfica also won the Iberian Cup II, beating Athletic Bilbao on aggregate. Eight years later, they were runners-up against Atlético de Madrid in Iberian Cup III. , Following the completion of improvements to the stadium, the board of Benfica decided to open the third tier of the Estádio da Luz, which transformed it into the biggest football stadium in Europe and third largest in the world , with a seating capacity of 120,000 spectators (up to 135,000 when they standed behind the goals). In 1986–87, John Moltimore won the Primeira Liga and Taça de Portugal , obtaining the ninth double for Benfica. , From 1988 to 1994, Benfica made a huge financial investment in an effort to win another European Cup, reaching two European Cup finals in 1988 and 1990 but lost them to PSV (on penalties) and Milan (1–0), respectively. During the same period of time, Benfica won three Primeira Liga ( 1988–89 , 1990–91 , 1993–94 ) and one Taça de Portugal ( 1993 ). In 1988–89, led by manager Toni , they only conceded 15 goals in 38 league matches, a club record.  , Financial trouble dating back to the 1980s [ citation needed ] when Benfica completed the third tier ( Terceiro Anel ) of the Estádio da Luz, along with the dream of becoming European champions again, started to deteriorate the club finances. The rampant spending and a questionable signing policy, which allowed for squads composed of well over 30 players, further aggravated the problem. [ citation needed ] , The period from 1994 through 2003 was the worst in their history. During this time, Benfica only won the Taça de Portugal in 1996 , suffered their biggest defeat in European competitions (7–0 against Celta de Vigo ) in 1999,  and had their lowest Primeira Liga finishing positions, such as sixth in 2000–01 and fourth in 2001–02 . The club entered in default during João Vale e Azevedo 's three-year presidency,  which further damaged the club finances and credibility, and nearly every year hired two or more managers. [ citation needed ] Eleven managers shared the seat from 1994 to 2003, including Mário Wilson , thrice.  , It was during this period that Benfica signed Simão Sabrosa for €12 million,  and decided to build the new Estádio da Luz on 28 September 2001, which would eventually cost €162 million.   , In the 2003–04 season , with a new president, Luís Filipe Vieira , and manager José Antonio Camacho , who had joined in 2002,  Benfica won their 24th Taça de Portugal defeating José Mourinho 's Porto in the final (2–1).
