 Michael Fred Phelps II (born June 30, 1985) is an American competition swimmer and the most decorated Olympian of all time , with a total of 22 medals. Phelps also holds the all-time records for Olympic gold medals (18, double the second highest record holders), Olympic gold medals in individual events (11), and Olympic medals in individual events for a male (13). In winning eight gold medals at the 2008 Beijing Games , Phelps took the record for the most first-place finishes at any single Olympic Games . Five of those victories were in individual events, tying the single Games record . In the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Phelps won four golds and two silver medals, making him the most successful athlete of the Games for the third Olympics in a row.  , Phelps is the long course world recordholder in the 100-meter butterfly , 200-meter butterfly and 400-meter individual medley as well as the former long course world recordholder in the 200-meter freestyle and 200-meter individual medley . He has won a total of 77 medals in major international long-course competition, totalling 61 gold, 13 silver, and 3 bronze spanning the Olympics, the World , and the Pan Pacific Championships. Phelps's international titles and record-breaking performances have earned him the World Swimmer of the Year Award seven times and American Swimmer of the Year Award nine times as well as the FINA Swimmer of the Year Award in 2012. His unprecedented Olympic success in 2008 earned Phelps Sports Illustrated magazine's Sportsman of the Year award. , After the 2008 Summer Olympics, Phelps started the Michael Phelps Foundation, which focuses on growing the sport of swimming and promoting healthier lifestyles. He continues to work with his foundation after the 2012 Olympics, which he has said will be his last. In April 2014, Phelps announced he would come out of retirement, and would enter an event later that month.  , , , Phelps was born and raised in the Rodgers Forge neighborhood of Towson, Maryland , located just north of Baltimore .  He attended Rodgers Forge Elementary, Dumbarton Middle School , and Towson High School .  Michael is the youngest of three children. His mother, Deborah Sue "Debbie" (née Davisson), is a middle school principal.  His father, Michael Fred Phelps, is a retired Maryland state trooper who played football in high school and college and tried out for the Washington Redskins in the 1970s.   Phelps's parents divorced in 1994, and his father remarried in 2000.  His ancestry includes English , Irish , Scottish , Welsh , and German .  Phelps graduated from Towson High School in 2003.  , Phelps began swimming at the age of seven, partly because of the influence of his sisters and partly to provide him with an outlet for his energy.  When Phelps was in the sixth grade, he was diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).   By the age of 10, he held a national record for his age group, and Phelps began to train at the North Baltimore Aquatic Club under coach Bob Bowman . More age group records followed, and Phelps's rapid improvement culminated in his qualifying for the 2000 Summer Olympics at the age of 15 and becoming the youngest male to make a U.S. Olympic swim team in 68 years.  While he did not win a medal, he did make the finals and finished fifth in the 200-meter butterfly .  , At the World Championship Trials for the 2001 World Aquatics Championships , on March 30, Phelps broke the world record in the 200-meter butterfly to become, at 15 years and 9 months, the youngest man ever to set a swimming world record, breaking the record previously held by Ian Thorpe when he lowered the 400-meter freestyle world record at 16 years, 10 months.  At the World Championships in Fukuoka, Japan, Phelps broke his own world record in the 200-meter butterfly en route to becoming a world champion for the first time.  , At Nationals, the selection meet for the 2002 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships , in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Phelps set an American record in the 200-meter individual medley and was just off the world record in the 200-meter butterfly.  In the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps bettered the world record held by Tom Dolan with a time of 4:11.09, just ahead of Erik Vendt , who finished second with a time of 4:11.27, also below the old world record. In the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps was barely beaten by Klete Keller and in the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps beat Ian Crocker .  , At the 2002 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Yokohama, Japan, Phelps won three gold medals and two silvers. In his first event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps won gold ahead of Erik Vendt with a time of 4:12.48. In the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps lost to Tom Malchow , finishing behind him 1:55.41 to 1:55.21. Phelps said he lost because he did not take butterfly training seriously after he broke the world record. In the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps won with a time of 1:59.70. In the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, along with Nate Dusing , Klete Keller, and Chad Carvin , won the silver medal with a time 7:11.81 finishing behind Australia. The U.S. 4×100-meter medley relay team consisted of Aaron Peirsol , Brendan Hansen , Phelps, and Ian Crocker. In the final for the medley relay, Phelps swam a 51.1 split, at the time the fastest split in history. The final time of 3:33.48 was a world record.  , At Nationals, Phelps won the 200-meter freestyle, 200-meter backstroke, and the 100-meter butterfly.  He became the first American swimmer to win three different races in three different strokes at a national championship.  At the 2003 Duel in the Pool, a meet that pits swimming stars from Australia and the United States, Phelps broke the world record in the 400-meter individual medley with a time of 4:10.73 and almost broke the world record in the 100-meter butterfly, just missing the record by 0.03 seconds.  At a meet in Santa Clara County, California, Phelps broke the world record in the 200-meter individual medley with a time of 1:57.94.  Phelps said he broke the 200-meter individual medley world record after Don Talbot said Phelps was unproven, using his words as motivation.  , At the 2003 World Aquatics Championships , Phelps won four gold medals, two silver medals, and broke five world records.  Phelps broke his first world record on July 22 in the semi-finals for the 200-meter butterfly. Phelps swam a 1:53.93 to break his own world record of 1:54.58 set in 2001 and became the first man to swim under 1:54.00.  In the final of the 200-meter butterfly, on July 23, Phelps easily won the gold medal, but did not come close to his world record with a time of 1:54.35.  Less than an hour later, Phelps swam the lead-off leg for the 4×200-meter freestyle relay. Phelps put up a solid time of 1:46.60 (an American record) but the Americans could not match the depth of the Australians and ultimately finished second 7:10.26 to 7:08.58.  In the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps dominated. On July 24, in the semifinals of the 200-meter individual medley, he broke his own world record with a time of 1:57.52.  On July 25, in the final of the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps smashed his own record with a time of 1:56.04 to win the gold medal and finished almost 3 seconds ahead of Ian Thorpe .  About an hour before the final of the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps swam in the semifinals of the 100-meter butterfly. Phelps dominated again, finishing in the top seed position with a world record time of 51.47.  However, in the final of the 100-meter butterfly, on July 26, Ian Crocker erased Phelps's world record with a time of 50.98, to become the first man under 51 seconds. Phelps swam a 51.10 (also under his former world record), but had to settle for silver.  In the final of the 400-meter individual medley, on July 27, Phelps broke his own world record with a time of 4:09.09 to easily claim the gold medal.  About half an hour later, Phelps earned his final gold medal when the United States team won the 4×100-meter medley relay.  Phelps did not swim in the finals, but still earned a medal because he swam in the heats.  , At the 2004 U.S. Olympic Team Trials , Phelps competed in six events; the 200- and 400-medley individual medley, the 100- and 200-meter butterfly, the 200-meter freestyle, and the 200-meter backstroke.  In his first event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps easily won with a world record time of 4:08.41.  Two days later, in the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won with a time of 1:46.27, finishing sixth-tenths of a second ahead of Klete Keller .  Phelps, however, was not pleased with the result and wanted to be in the 1:45s and was uncertain if he would swim the event in Athens.  The following day, Phelps won in the 200-meter butterfly with a time of 1:54.31, three seconds ahead of second-place finisher Tom Malchow .  After two days off, Phelps was back in the pool and finished second to Aaron Peirsol in the 200-meter backstroke.  Less than half an hour later, Phelps won the 200-meter individual medley title ahead of Ryan Lochte by 2.70 seconds.   The following day, Phelps finished second to Ian Crocker in the 100-meter butterfly. Crocker won in a time of 50.76, a world record and 0.39 seconds ahead of Phelps.  When the Trials were over, Phelps became the first person to qualify in six individual events for a U.S. Olympic team.  However, Phelps dropped the 200-meter backstroke to focus on the 200-meter freestyle because he wanted to race Ian Thorpe .  Even though Phelps didn't compete in the 100-meter freestyle at the Trials, he was still selected for the 4×100-meter freestyle relay. Gary Hall, Jr. thought this was unfair and said Phelps did not deserve a spot on the relay. Phelps argued his program was too crowded to compete in 100-meter freestyle and was at least among the top four swimmers because he had beaten the top-seeded Jason Lezak the last time he had swum against him.  , In his first event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps won with a world record time of 4:08.26 to win his first Olympic gold medal.   The following day, in the 4×100-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, along with Ian Crocker , Neil Walker , and Jason Lezak , finished in third place with a time of 3:14.62.   Crocker's lead-off time of 50.05 was the worst among the field and was blamed on sickness.   In the event many were calling The Race of the Century , held the following day, Phelps finished in third place behind Ian Thorpe and Pieter van den Hoogenband in the 200-meter freestyle.   Although this race ended the chance to match Spitz's record, Phelps had savored the challenge even though it was not his strongest event, saying "How can I be disappointed? I swam in a field with the two fastest freestylers of all time".  In his fourth event, the 200-meter butterfly, held the following day, Phelps finished first with a time of 1:54.04, breaking Tom Malchow 's Olympic record.   About an hour later, in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, along with Ryan Lochte , Peter Vanderkaay , and Klete Keller , finished in first place with a time of 7:07.33.  Two days later, in the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps finished first with a time of 1:57.14, an Olympic record.  In the 100-meter butterfly final, held the following day, Phelps defeated American teammate Ian Crocker (who held the world record in the event at the time) by just 0.04 seconds with a time of 51.25.   Traditionally, the American who places highest in an individual event will be automatically given the corresponding leg in the 4×100-meter medley relay final. This gave Phelps an automatic entry into the medley relay, but he deferred and Crocker swam instead.   Phelps's gesture gave Crocker a chance to make amends as well getting his final shot at a gold medal.  The American medley team went on to win the event in world-record time, and, since Phelps had raced in a preliminary heat of the medley relay, he was also awarded a gold medal along with the team members who competed in the final.   In winning six gold and two bronze medals, Phelps, still a teenager, had the second-best performance ever at a single Olympics, behind Mark Spitz 's seven gold medals at the 1972 Summer Olympics . Also, he became the second male swimmer ever to win more than two individual titles at a single Games with four, tying Spitz's four from 1972. , At the 2005 World Championship Trials, Phelps decided to drop his specialty events, the 400-meter individual medley and the 200-meter butterfly, and experiment with the 400-meter freestyle and the 100-meter freestyle.  Phelps went on to win the 400-meter freestyle, the 200-meter freestyle, the 100-meter butterfly, the 100-meter freestyle, and the 200-meter individual medley at the Trials.      , At the 2005 World Aquatics Championships , Phelps won a total of six medals, 5 golds and one silver.  In the 400-meter freestyle, Phelps did not make it past the preliminary heats and finished 18th overall with a time of 3:50.53.  Later that day, in the 4×100-meter freestyle relay, Phelps won his first gold in the Championships.  Two days later, on July 26, Phelps won his second gold in the 200-meter freestyle with a new American record time of 1:45.20, finishing ahead of Grant Hackett .  Two days later, on July 28, Phelps finished seventh in the 100-meter freestyle final.  Later that day, Phelps won his third gold in the 200-meter individual medley.  On July 29, Phelps, along with Ryan Lochte , Peter Vanderkaay and Klete Keller , won the gold in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay with a time of 7:06.58. This was the fourth gold medal for Phelps.  On July 30, Phelps swam in his last individual event, the 100-meter butterfly. In the final, Phelps could not match the speed of Ian Crocker and had to settle for silver, finishing 51.65 to 50.40.  On July 31, Phelps earned his final gold medal when the United States team won the 4×100-meter medley relay.  Phelps did not swim in the finals but still earned a medal because he swam in the heats.  , At the 2006 National Championships, Phelps won a total of three events.  In his first event, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won with a time of 1:54.32.  In his second event, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps just edged out Ian Crocker 51.51 to 51.73.  In his third event, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps won with a time of 1:56.50, just ahead of Ryan Lochte 's time of 1:56.78.  , At the 2006 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Victoria, British Columbia, Phelps won five gold medals and one silver.  In his first event, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won in a world record time of 1:53.80, his first world record in two years.  In his second event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps easily won with a time of 4:10.47, 3.38 seconds ahead of second-place finisher Robert Margalis .  In his third event, the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, along with Ryan Lochte , Peter Vanderkaay , and Klete Keller , won the gold medal with a time of 7:05.28.  In his fourth event, the 200-meter backstroke, Phelps won the silver medal, finishing behind Aaron Peirsol 1:56.81 to 1:54.44.  In his fifth event, the 4×100-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, along with Neil Walker , Cullen Jones , and Jason Lezak , won the gold medal with a world-record time 3:12.46.  In his sixth event, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps won with a world record time of 1:55.84, breaking his record of 1:55.94 set in 2003.  , At the 2007 World Aquatics Championships , Phelps won seven gold medals, tying the record, and broke five world records.  Phelps first gold medal came in the 4×100-meter freestyle. Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 48.42 seconds and Neil Walker , Cullen Jones and Jason Lezak each expanded the lead to win in a Championship record of 3:12.72, just missing the world record of 3:12.46 set the previous year.  His lead-off time was faster than the winning time in the individual 100-meter freestyle final later in the meet. Phelps set his first world record in the Championships in the 200-meter freestyle, his second race. Phelps won the gold ahead of Pieter van den Hoogenband and broke Ian Thorpe 's six-year-old world record with a time of 1:43.86.  For his third race, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won the gold and bettered his own world record of 1:53.71 with a time of 1:52.09.  For his fourth race, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps set his third world record with a time of 1:54.98, bettering his own world-record time of 1:55.84  For his fifth race, the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 1:45.36 as the American team of Ryan Lochte , Klete Keller , and Peter Vanderkaay went on to win the gold medal and beat the previous world record set by Australia in 2001 with a time 7:03.24.  For his sixth race, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps edged out Ian Crocker 50.77 to 50.82 to win his sixth gold medal.  For his seventh event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps won the gold medal in a world-record time of 4:06.22, more than 3.5 seconds ahead of Ryan Lochte .  By winning seven gold medals, Phelps broke the record of six set by Ian Thorpe at the 2001 World Championships . The 4×100-meter medley relay team would have competed in the final, but received a disqualification for a false start during a changeover in the heats, ending Phelps's chance of eight gold medals.  , Even though Phelps competed in the backstroke in international competition only once (at the 2006 Pan Pacific Championships ), he was among the best backstroke swimmers in the world. This is illustrated by his personal best times set in 2007, four months after the World Championships. At the US Nationals in Indianapolis on August 1, 2007, Phelps swam a 1:54.65 in the 200-meter backstroke, which was the third fastest of all time in the event, 0.33 of a second off the world record of 1:54.32 held by Ryan Lochte .  Two days later Phelps swam a time of 53.01 sec in the 100-meter backstroke, 0.03 of a second short of the world record of 52.98 held by Aaron Peirsol and the second-fastest performance of all time.  In 2007 Phelps swam into the all-time top 3 performances in seven individual events, four of these being world records. , At the 2008 U.S. Olympic Team Trials , Phelps competed in six individual events. In his first event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps broke his own world record of 4:06.22 with a time of 4:05.25.  In his second event, the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won with a time of 1:44.10, ahead of Peter Vanderkaay 's time 1:45.85.  In his third event, the 100-meter freestyle, Phelps placed second in his heat with a time of 47.92, ensuring him a spot on the relay.  In his fourth event, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won with a time of 1:52.20.  In his fifth event, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps broke his own world record of 1:54.98 with a time of 1:54.80.  In his sixth and final event, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won with a time of 50.89.  When asked about his chances of winning eight gold medals in Beijing, Phelps said, "I am going to prepare for that meet just like I do every other meet ... There is only so much I can do in a month and then I am going to prepare myself the best that I can."  , Phelps set an Olympic record in the preliminary heats of the 400-meter individual medley.   He followed that up in the final by winning the gold medal, as well as breaking his previous world record by nearly two seconds.   , Phelps swam the first leg of the 4×100-meter freestyle relay in a time of 47.51 seconds (an American record for the 100-meter freestyle), and won his second gold medal of the 2008 Olympics, as well as setting his second world record of the Olympics (3:08.24).  Teammate Jason Lezak , after beginning the anchor leg more than half a body length behind Alain Bernard , managed to finish ahead of the second-place French team by eight hundredths of a second. The top five teams in the final finished ahead of the world record of 3:12.23 set the previous day by the American B team in a preliminary heat.  , For his third race, Phelps broke his previous world record in the 200-meter freestyle by nearly a second and won his third gold medal. He also set his third world record at the Olympics, 1:42.96, winning by nearly two seconds over silver medalist Park Tae-Hwan .  In this race, Phelps became only the fifth Olympic athlete in modern history to win nine gold medals, joining Mark Spitz , Larisa Latynina , Paavo Nurmi , and Carl Lewis .  , The next day, Phelps participated in two finals. In his first event, the 200-meter butterfly , Phelps made it four gold medals and world records in four events by swimming the final in 1:52.03, defeating silver medalist László Cseh by almost seven-tenths of a second despite his goggles' having filled up with water and being unable to "see anything for the last 100 meters.  This fourth gold medal was his tenth, and made him the all-time leader for most Olympic gold medals won by an individual in the modern Olympic era.  Moreover, Phelps became the first swimmer, male or female, to win three Olympic butterfly titles, after his two titles in the Athens 2004 Olympics. He also became the first swimmer to successfully defend an Olympic butterfly title. , Less than one hour after his gold medal victory in the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps swam the lead-off leg of the 4×200-meter freestyle relay. With Lochte, Ricky Berens , and Peter Vanderkaay , he won his fifth gold and set his fifth world record as the American team finished first with a time of 6:58.56. The Americans were the first team to break the seven-minute mark in the relay, and broke the previous record, set in Melbourne, Australia, by more than four and a half seconds.  , After taking a day off from finals (Phelps did swim in qualifying heats), Phelps won his sixth gold of the Beijing Games on August 15 by winning the 200-meter individual medley with a world record time of 1:54.23, finishing ahead of Cseh by over two seconds.  , Before the final of the 100-meter butterfly, US born Serbian swimmer Milorad Čavić caused a minor stir when he said it would be "good" if Phelps lost. "It'd be good for him if he loses. It would be nice if historians talk about Michael Phelps winning seven gold medals and losing the eighth to 'some guy.' I'd like to be that guy", Čavić said.  Phelps responded, "When people say things like that, it fires me up more than anything."  On August 16, Phelps won his seventh gold medal of the Games in the men's 100-meter butterfly, setting an Olympic record for the event with a time of 50.58 seconds and edging out his nearest competitor Čavić, by one hundredth (0.01) of a second.  , Unlike all six of his previous events in the 2008 Games, Phelps did not set a new world record, leaving intact Ian Crocker 's world-record time of 50.40 seconds, set in 2005. , Phelps's 0.01-second finish ahead of Čavić prompted the Serbian delegation to file a protest. Subsequent analysis of the video by the FINA panel, which required analyzing frames shot 1/10,000th of a second apart, was used to officially confirm Phelps's victory,  but the images were not immediately released to the press. The initial refusal by official timekeeper Omega to release underwater photos of the finish also raised questions due to Phelps's sponsorship relationship with Omega.  Čavić later wrote in his blog, "People, this is the greatest moment of my life. If you ask me, it should be accepted and we should move on. I've accepted defeat, and there's nothing wrong with losing to the greatest swimmer there has ever been."  In April 2015 Spitz said he had been sent an email posted by Omega that had said Phelps had lost the 100m butterfly final.  , Phelps's seventh gold medal of the Games tied Mark Spitz 's record for gold medals won in a single Olympic Games, set in the 1972 Olympics. It was also his fifth individual gold medal in Beijing, tying the record for individual gold medals at a single Games originally set by Eric Heiden in the 1980 Winter Olympics and equaled by Vitaly Scherbo at the 1992 Summer Games. Said Phelps upon setting his seventh-straight Olympic record of the Games in as many events, "Dream as big as you can dream, and anything is possible ... I am sort of in a dream world. Sometimes I have to pinch myself to make sure it is real."  , On August 17, Phelps won his eighth gold medal in the 4×100-meter medley relay, breaking Mark Spitz 's record of seven gold medals won in a single Olympic Games, which had stood since 1972.  Phelps, along with teammates Brendan Hansen , Aaron Peirsol , and Jason Lezak , set a new world record in the event with a time of 3 minutes and 29.34 seconds, 0.7 seconds ahead of second-place Australia and 1.34 seconds faster than the previous record set by the United States at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. When Phelps dived in to swim the 100-meter butterfly leg, the third leg of the 400-meter medley, the United States had been trailing Australia and Japan. Phelps completed his split in 50.1 seconds, the fastest butterfly split ever for the event, giving teammate Jason Lezak a more than half-second lead for the final leg, which he held onto to clinch the event in world record time.  Said Phelps, upon completing the event that awarded him his eighth gold medal and eighth Olympic record in as many events, "Records are always made to be broken no matter what they are ... Anybody can do anything that they set their mind to."  , At the 2009 National Championships, Phelps drastically shortened his program, swimming in only three individual events. In his first event, the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won with a time of 1:44.23.  In his second event, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps easily won with a time of 1:52.76, 0.88 seconds ahead of the second-place finisher.  In his third event, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won with a world-record time of 50.22.  , At the 2009 World Aquatics Championships , Phelps won a total of 6 medals, 5 golds and 1 silver. In his first event, the 4×100-meter freestyle relay, Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 47.78, well off his 47.51 performance in Beijing, but the American team was able to edge out Russia and France for the gold.  For his second race, the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps lost his first race in four years to Germany's Paul Biedermann . Phelps touched second in 1:43.22, but Biedermann smashed Phelps's record of 1:42.96 set in Beijing a year ago with a time of 1:42.00.  Phelps took the silver graciously, but coach Bob Bowman threatened to withdraw Phelps from international competition because Bowman claimed Biedermann had an unfair advantage because he was wearing a full polyurethane swimsuit , specifically an Arena X-Glide . Bowman said, "It took me five years to get Michael from 1:46 to 1:42 and this guy has done it in 11 months. That's an amazing training performance. I'd like to know how to do that."  Phelps rebounded from this loss and for his third race, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won the gold and broke his own world record of 1:52.03 with a time of 1:51.51.  For his fourth race, the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 1:44.49 as the team went on to win the gold medal and break the world record set the previous year.  After his loss in the 200-meter freestyle, many thought Phelps was vulnerable coming into the final for the 100-meter butterfly.  His closest competitor, Milorad Čavić , who wore an Arena X-Glide (the same suit Biedermann beat Phelps with), thought people were making excuses for Phelps because he was wearing an LZR Racer . Čavić even offered to buy Phelps a new suit.  For his fifth race, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won the gold and became the first man to complete it in under 50 seconds, beating Čavić 49.82 to 49.95.  The victory prompted a fierce celebration from Phelps, who sat on the lane rope and pumped his chest and swimsuit.  For his final event, the 4×100-meter medley relay, Phelps won his fifth gold medal. Phelps, along with teammates Aaron Peirsol , Eric Shanteau , and David Walters , set a new world record in the event with a time of 3 minutes and 27.28 seconds.  , At the 2010 National Championships , Phelps competed in five individual events. In the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won ahead of Ryan Lochte in a time of 1:45.61.  About an hour later, Phelps returned to the pool to win the 200-meter butterfly.  But Phelps was not happy with his performance and called it the "worst" 200-meter butterfly of his life. In the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won his 50th national title in 50.65.  After the race, Phelps said he was "fairly pleased" with the result.   In the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps finished second to Lochte 1:55.94 to 1:54.84.  It was the first time Lochte had beat Phelps in a major national meet.  In the 200-meter backstroke, Phelps finished in 4th place in 1:56.98.  , On the first day of competition at the 2010 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships , Phelps opted out swimming in the final of the 200-meter freestyle to focus on the 200-meter butterfly. In the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps led from start to finish, coming in first with a time of 1:54.11. Although it was much slower than his 1:51.51 time from the previous year, Phelps had not lost a 200-meter butterfly final since 2002.   On day two of the competition, Phelps swam in the heats of the 400-meter individual medley and contributed in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay. In the heats of the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps failed to make the A final, with Lochte and Tyler Clary taking the top two American positions.  Phelps did not swim in the B final of the 400-meter individual medley. In the 4×200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, with Peter Vanderkaay , Ricky Berens , and Lochte, finished first ahead of Japan and Australia.  On day three of the competition, Phelps competed in the 100-meter butterfly and contributed in the 4×100-meter freestyle relay. In the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps finished first in a time of 50.86, a championship record.  In the 4×100-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, with Lochte, Jason Lezak , and Nathan Adrian , finished first ahead of Australia and South Africa. As the lead-off leg in the 4×100-meter freestyle relay, Phelps set the championship record in the 100-meter freestyle with a time of 48.13.  In his final event, Phelps swam in the 4×100-meter medley relay with Aaron Peirsol , Mark Gangloff , and Adrian and finished first ahead of Japan and Australia.  , In his first event at the 2011 World Aquatics Championships in Shanghai, Phelps won bronze in the 4×100-meter freestyle relay with Garrett Weber-Gale , Jason Lezak , and Nathan Adrian .  This was Phelps's first bronze in a World Aquatics Championships . Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 48.08, the second-best lead-off in the field behind James Magnussen 's 47.49. In his second event, the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won silver for the second consecutive time at a World Aquatics Championships. This time he finished second to Ryan Lochte in the event with a time of 1:44.79, compared to Lochte's time of 1:44.44.  In his third final, the 200-meter butterfly, he won his first gold medal with a time of 1:53.34 to become the first swimmer to win five gold medals in one discipline at the World Aquatics Championships.  In his fourth event, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps again finished second to Lochte in a personal best of 1:54.16, which was 0.16 behind Lochte who swam a new world record.  It was Phelps's 30th medal in the World Aquatics Championships. Shortly after completing the semifinals of the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps competed in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay with Peter Vanderkaay , Ricky Berens , and Ryan Lochte . Phelps's team won the gold medal in a time of 7:02.67. Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 1:45.53, the third-best leg in the field.  In the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won his third consecutive title (also winning in 2007 and 2009) and second individual title of the meet with a time of 50.71.  In his last event, the 4×100-meter medley relay, Phelps teamed with Nick Thoman , Mark Gangloff , and Nathan Adrian to win gold in a time of 3:32.06. Phelps's butterfly leg of 50.57 was by far the fastest butterfly leg in the field.  , For the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Phelps originally stated he would never do eight events again, and would instead try new events. Phelps said, "I keep saying I want to go down and start sprinting, but Bob [Bowman, Phelps's coach] really isn't so keen on that ... I don't think that's going to happen ... Over the next four years, I'd like to try some different events, maybe not do some of the events I did here."   However, at the 2012 United States Olympic Trials , the qualifying meet for the 2012 Summer Olympics, Phelps qualified in the same eight events that he swam in Beijing in 2008. He later dropped the 200-meter freestyle from his program, as he stated he wanted to focus on the 4×100-meter freestyle relay.  During the trials, Phelps finished first in the 200-meter freestyle, 100-meter butterfly, 200-meter butterfly, 200-meter individual medley, and second in the 400-meter individual medley. In making his fourth Olympic team, Phelps holds the record for men for the most Olympic appearances in swimming representing the United States.  , On July 28, 2012, Phelps placed eighth in the morning prelims. Phelps, the two-time defending Olympic champion, won his 400 IM heat in 4 minutes, 13.33 seconds with a time that was well off his world record of 4:03.84 set four years ago in Beijing, when Phelps won a record eight gold medals. He had just barely out touched second-place finisher in his heat László Cseh by 0.07 seconds. In his first finals of the Summer Olympics, Phelps placed fourth behind fellow American Ryan Lochte , Thiago Pereira of Brazil , and Kosuke Hagino of Japan in the 400-meter individual medley . It was the first time Phelps failed to medal in an Olympic event since 2000.  The next night, in his second event of the Games, he got a silver as a member of the 4×100-meter free relay . Phelps swam the fastest leg of the US relay team and the second-fastest of anyone in the race.  , On July 31, 2012, Phelps won a silver medal in the 200-meter butterfly behind South African Chad le Clos by only 5/100ths of a second, and a gold medal in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay , thereby equaling and then surpassing Larisa Latynina to become the all-time record holder for most Olympic medals won.   Latynina was present at the race and asked to be the presenter of Phelps's medal, but was told that Olympic rules would not allow it. She called Phelps deserving of the record.  , On August 2, 2012, Phelps won his 16th Olympic Gold Medal when he edged out Ryan Lochte to win the 200-meter individual medley with a time of 1:54.27, and by that victory also became the first male swimmer to win the same event in three consecutive Olympics.  Rebecca Soni and Phelps (twice) are the only swimmers to successfully defend an individual title from the 2008 Games.  This win also marked Phelps's fifth Olympic title in the individual medley, breaking the record of four shared by Hungarian Tamás Darnyi and Ukrainian Yana Klochkova . , He repeated the achievement of winning the same event at three Olympics the following evening, winning the Olympic gold medal in the 100 m butterfly , his last individual event.  After two very close victories in the 100 m butterfly at the 2004 and 2008 Olympics (by 0.04 and 0.01 sec, respectively), in this race Phelps beat Le Clos and Yevgeny Korotyshkin , who tied for silver, by 0.23 sec. , Phelps's final event was the 4×100-meter medley relay in which he went on to win his 18th career gold medal and his 22nd overall. By winning 4 gold and 2 silver medals, Phelps concluded the 2012 Olympics as the most successful swimmer of the meet for the third Olympics in a row.   After his last event, the international swimming federation FINA honored Phelps with an award commemorating his standing as the most decorated Olympian ever.  , In April 2014, Phelps announced he would come out of retirement, and would enter an event later that month.  In May 2014, he won the 100-meter butterfly event at the Arena Grand Prix in Charlotte, North Carolina.  , During the 2008 Olympics, Phelps was questioned by the press as to whether perhaps his feats were "too good to be true", a reference to unsupported rumors that Phelps might be taking performance enhancing drugs .   In response, Phelps noted that he had signed up for Project Believe, a project by the United States Anti-Doping Agency in which U.S. Olympians can volunteer to be tested in excess of the World Anti-Doping Agency guidelines.  During the Games, Phelps passed all nine tests that were administered to him.   , Phelps has trained under Bob Bowman since he was 11 years old.  Bowman swam for Florida State University from 1983 to 1985.  Phelps has said Bowman reminded him of a drill sergeant because of his disciplined and regimented ways.  However, Phelps has said, "Training with Bob is the smartest thing I've ever done ... I'm not going to swim for anyone else."  After the 2004 Summer Olympics, Bowman was hired as the head coach for the University of Michigan after Jon Urbanchek retired. Phelps joined Bowman at Michigan to train and attended classes, but did not pursue a degree.   Phelps served as a volunteer assistant coach at Michigan.  After the 2008 Summer Olympics, Bowman returned to Baltimore as CEO at the North Baltimore Aquatic Club . Phelps also returned to Baltimore with Bowman.  , Bob Bowman described Phelps as "a solitary man"  with a "rigid focus"  at the pool prior to a race, but afterwards "a man incredibly invested in the success of the people he cares about".  "He's unbelievably kind-hearted",  recounting Phelps's interaction with young children after practices.  In February 2015, Phelps announced he was engaged to Nicole Johnson .  , In November 2004, at the age of 19, Phelps was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol in Salisbury, Maryland.  He pleaded guilty to driving while impaired , and was sentenced to serve 18 months' probation , fined $250, ordered to speak to high school students about drinking and driving and to attend a Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) meeting.  Asked about the incident later by Matt Lauer on the Today Show , Phelps said that he had "let a lot of people in the country down."  , In February 2009, publication of a photograph of Phelps using a water pipe , a device used for smoking tobacco or marijuana , resulted in the loss of the Kellogg Company as a sponsor, as well as a three-month suspension by USA Swimming . Phelps admitted that the photo, taken at a party at the University of South Carolina , was authentic. He publicly apologized, saying his behavior was "inappropriate".  , In September 2014, he was arrested again, on driving under the influence of alcohol and speeding charges in Baltimore, Maryland.   As a result, USA Swimming suspended him from all competitions for six months, and stated he would not be chosen to represent the United States at the 2015 World Aquatics Championships in August.  , Phelps idolized Australian swimmer Ian Thorpe as a teenager, modelling his public image after him.  Thorpe initially said it was highly unlikely for Phelps to win eight gold medals at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.  Phelps used the remarks as motivation, taping them to his locker during the Games.  Thorpe was in the stands for the 4×100-meter medley relay , where Phelps was swimming for his eighth Olympic title. When Phelps and his teammates captured the gold, Thorpe gave a congratulatory kiss to Phelps's mother, then gave a handshake and a hug to congratulate Phelps. Thorpe afterwards said "I'm really proud of him not just because he won eight golds. Rather, it's how much he has grown up and matured into a great human being. Never in my life have I been so happy to have been proved wrong."   , After the 2008 Olympics, Phelps used his $1 million Speedo bonus to set up the Michael Phelps Foundation.    His foundation focuses on growing the sport of swimming and promoting healthier lifestyles.  , In 2010, the Michael Phelps Foundation, the Michael Phelps Swim School and KidsHealth .org developed and nationally piloted the "im" program for Boys & Girls Club members. The im program teaches children the importance of being active and healthy, with a focus on the sport of swimming. It also promotes the value of planning and goal-setting.  im is offered through the Boys & Girls Clubs of America  and through Special Olympics International.  The Foundation has since developed two other programs, Level Field Fund-Swimming and Caps-for-a-Cause.   , The Foundation's largest event is its annual fundraiser, the Michael Phelps Foundation Golf Classic.   Phelps stated he hopes to work with Foundation more after he retires from competition following the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.  , r = relay lead-off , With 39 world records (29 individual, 10 relay), Phelps set more records than any other swimmer, surpassing Mark Spitz 's previous record of 33 world records (26 individual, 7 relay). , All but two of the records were set in a long-course (50-meter) pool; records that currently stand are indicated in bold . Currently, he holds seven world records, not including his records for most Olympic medals and most Olympic gold medals ever won by one person.  Mark Andrew Spitz (born February 10, 1950) is an American former competition swimmer , nine-time Olympic champion, and former world record-holder in seven events. He won seven gold medals at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, an achievement surpassed only by Michael Phelps , who won eight golds at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Spitz set new world records in all seven events in which he competed in 1972, a record that still stands. Since the year 1900, no other swimmer has gained so great a percentage of all the medals awarded for Olympic events held in a single Games. , Between 1968 and 1972, Spitz won nine Olympic golds plus a silver and a bronze, five Pan American golds, 31 Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) titles, and eight National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) titles. During those years, he set 35 world records, but two were in trials and unofficial.   With his seven-gold medal performance at Munich in 1972, he was the most decorated athlete in the history of the Olympic Games until Michael Phelp's eight-gold medal performance at Beijing 36 years later in 2008. He was named World Swimmer of the Year in 1969, 1971 and 1972 by Swimming World Magazine . He was the third athlete to win nine Olympic gold medals . , , , Spitz was born in Modesto, California , the first of three children  of Arnold and Lenore (Smith) Spitz. His family is Jewish, the grandparents left Hungary after World War II.    When he was two years old, Spitz's family moved to Honolulu, Hawaii, where he swam at Waikiki beach every day. "You should have seen that little boy dash into the ocean. He'd run like he was trying to commit suicide." Lenore Spitz told a reporter for Time (April 12, 1968).  At age six his family returned to Sacramento, California , and he began to compete at his local swim club. At age nine, he was training at Arden Hills Swim Club in Sacramento with swimming coach Sherm Chavoor , who mentored seven Olympic medal winners including Spitz. , Before he was 10, Spitz held 17 national age-group records, and one world record. [ citation needed ] At 14 his family moved to Santa Clara so Spitz could train with coach George F. Haines of the Santa Clara Swim Club . From 1964 to 1968 Mark trained with Haines at SCHS and Santa Clara High School . During his four years there, Mark held national high school records in every stroke and in every distance [ citation needed ] . It was a remarkable and unprecedented achievement. In 1966 at age 16 he won the 100-meter butterfly at the AAU national championships, the first of his 24 AAU titles. The following year Mark set his first world record at a small California meet in the 400-meter freestyle with a time of 4:10.60, and emerged on the world swimming stage.  , The 1965 Maccabiah Games was his first international competition. At age 15 in Tel Aviv, Spitz, won four gold medals and was named the most outstanding athlete.  , He returned to Israel in 1969 following the Mexico Olympics to again compete in the Maccabiah Games. This time he won six gold medals.  He was again named outstanding athlete of the Games.  , In 1985 Spitz lit a torch to open the Maccabiah Games.  , In 2005 he was a member of the U.S. delegation at the 17th Maccabiah Games. He spoke at the JCC Maccabiah Games Opening Ceremonies, which was held in Richmond, Virginia. The Weinstein JCC in Richmond was one of the Host JCC's for the 2005 games with over 1,000 teenagers participating in various sports, including swimming. , In 1967 he won five gold medals at the 1967 Pan American Games , thereby setting a record that lasted until 2007 when Brazilian swimmer, Thiago Pereira , won six golds at the XV Pan American Games in Rio de Janeiro. , Holder of ten world records already, Spitz predicted brashly he would win six golds at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. However, he won only two team golds: the 4×100-meter freestyle relay in 3:31.70, and the 4×200-meter freestyle relay in 7:52.33.  In addition, Spitz finished second in the 100-meter butterfly in 56.40 seconds. In this event he was beaten by fellow American Doug Russell by a half second, despite holding the world record and having beaten Russell the previous ten times they had swum against each other that year.  Russell did briefly match Spitz's world record in late August 1967, holding the record equally with Spitz for five days before Spitz regained it solely on October 2, 1967. As a result of being beaten by Russell, Spitz did not get to swim in the 4×100-meter medley relay, which gave Russell his second gold medal and the USA team another world record performance. , Disappointed in his 1968 Olympic performance, Spitz decided in January 1969 to attend Indiana University  to train with legendary Indiana Hoosiers swimming coach Doc Counsilman ,  who was also his Olympic coach in Mexico City. He called choosing Indiana and Counsilman "the biggest decision of my life (and) the best."  While at Indiana, Spitz won eight individual NCAA titles. In 1971 he won the James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in the United States. Spitz also set a number of world records during the U.S. Olympic Swim Trials held in Chicago's Portage Park in 1972. , He was nicknamed "Mark the Shark" by his teammates. , At the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich (West Germany), Spitz was back to maintain his bid for the six gold medals. He did even more, winning seven Olympic gold medals. Further, Spitz set a new world record in each of the seven events – 100-meter freestyle (51.22), 200-meter freestyle (1:52.78), 100-meter butterfly (54.27), 200-meter butterfly (2:00.70), 4×100-meter freestyle relay (3:26.42), 4x200-meter freestyle relay (7:35.78), and 4×100-meter medley relay (3:48.16). Originally Spitz was reluctant to swim the 100-meter freestyle fearing a less than gold medal finish. Minutes before the race he confessed on the pool deck to ABC 's Donna de Varona , "I know I say I don't want to swim before every event but this time I'm serious. If I swim six and win six, I'll be a hero. If I swim seven and win six, I'll be a failure." Spitz won by half a stroke in a world-record time of 51.22 seconds.  , Spitz is one of five Olympians to win nine or more career gold medals : Larisa Latynina , Paavo Nurmi and Carl Lewis also have nine;  only swimmer Michael Phelps has won more with 18.  Spitz's record of seven gold medals in a single Olympics was not surpassed until Michael Phelps at the 2008 Summer Olympics . , During the Munich Massacre by Palestinian terrorists in the 1972 Olympics, Israeli racewalker Shaul Ladany awakened and alerted American track coach Bill Bowerman , who called for the U.S. Marines to come and protect American Jewish Olympians swimmer Spitz and javelin thrower Bill Schmidt .      , Following the Munich Olympics, Spitz retired from competition even though he was still only 22 years old. , In 1999 Spitz ranked No. 33 on ESPN SportsCentury 50 Greatest Athletes , the only aquatic athlete to make the list.  , At age 41, Spitz attempted a comeback for the 1992 Summer Olympics after film maker Bud Greenspan offered him a million dollars if he succeeded in qualifying. Filmed by Greenspan's cameras, Spitz did not beat the qualifying limit, despite his times being nearly as good as (and in some cases better than) his medal-winning times 20 years earlier. He was two seconds slower than the requisite qualifying time at the Olympic trials. Dara Torres made her successful Olympic comeback for the 2008 Summer Games, at the same age as Spitz. , After his retirement from competitive swimming at age 22, he was managed by the William Morris Agency , which tried to get him into show business while his name was still familiar due to his athletic success. , A poster featuring Spitz wearing his swimsuit and seven gold medals made him the hottest pin-up since Betty Grable .  , In 1973–74, Spitz appeared on TV's The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson and The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour . On the TV drama Emergency! , he portrayed Pete Barlow, who accidentally shoots his wife (played by Spitz's wife, Suzy). He also appeared briefly on the The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast of then-Governor of California Ronald Reagan in September 1973. , Spitz went to work for ABC Sports in 1976 and worked on many sports presentations, including coverage of the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal and the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.  In 1985 he appeared as a TV announcer in Challenge of a Lifetime . He continued as a broadcaster for some time, but within a few years, he was hardly seen as a public figure  except perhaps as a commentator for swimming events like the 2004 Summer Olympics . Instead Spitz focused on his real estate company in Beverly Hills and hobbies such as sailing.  , In 2006 he received critical praise [ citation needed ] for his narration of Freedom's Fury , a Hungarian documentary about the Olympic water polo team's famous Blood in the Water match against Russia during the Revolution of 1956 —considered the most famous match in water polo history . The film was executive produced by Quentin Tarantino and Lucy Liu , and made its debut at the Tribeca Film Festival . , He appeared in an ad for the California Milk Advisory Board. One of his print advertisements featured the caption "I always drink it-is something I like to do. I want to be loved by the mothers." , In 1974 he was in a number of Schick razors commercials.  In 1998 he appeared with Evel Knievel in a TV commercial for PlayStation . , In 2004 he appeared in a TV commercial for Sprint PCS.  Then in November 2007, Spitz made a cameo appearance on Amanda Beard 's first television commercial (for GoDaddy) featuring her own seven Olympic medals (won between 1996–2004). The ad was entitled "Shock".  Also, in 2007 he appeared in the infomercial for the "Orbitrek Elite" fitness workout.  , He appeared in a commercial for Lear Capital, a gold investment company. (at 8:13 and 15:42 on a video at http://www.stanpredicts.com/media.php dated February 12, 2011, but the commercial was edited out of the version labeled "Episode 1: Will Massive Amount [ sic ] Of Oil Be Discovered In Israel?") , In 2012 Spitz appeared in a commercial for Ageless Male, a testosterone supplement. , When Spitz returned from the Olympics, he began dating Suzy Weiner, a UCLA theater student and part-time model, who also was the daughter of one of his father's business acquaintances.   Less than a year after the Munich Olympics, they were married on May 6, 1973,  in a traditional Jewish service at the Beverly Hills Hotel.  They have two sons, Matthew (born October 1981) and Justin (born September 1991). Justin currently will be a senior at Stanford University , and was a member of the swim team.    , From 1964 to 1968 Spitz attended Santa Clara High School. [ citation needed ] After graduating he went on to Indiana University .  At Indiana University from 1968 to 1972, he was a pre-dental student and member of Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity. Time magazine asked him if he wanted to return to dental school after the Olympics. "I always wanted to be a dentist from the time I was in high school, and I was accepted to dental school in the spring of 1972. I was planning to go, but after the Olympics there were other opportunities. I did some television and speaking engagements, and things just went from there."  , In 1972, soon after his return to the United States, Spitz landed several lucrative corporate endorsement contracts. He earned about $7 million in a two-year period.  However, as the memory of his feats receded, so did his endorsement and promotional deals. As his endorsements faded he started a successful real-estate company in Beverly Hills. He bought a Ferrari and says he made more than $1 million. [ citation needed ] "A million dollars in 1972 would be equivalent to more than $10 million today," Spitz said. "I did very well, thank you very much."  "I would say I was a pioneer. There wasn't anyone who'd gone to the Olympics before me who capitalized the same way on opportunity. It depends on timing, it depends on hype, it depends on the economy, and most importantly, it depends on looks. I mean, I've never seen a magazine of uglies. That's our society. I'm not saying it's right. That's just the facts."  , Per his official website, Spitz is self-employed as a corporate spokesperson and motivational speaker. However, Sports Yahoo! lists his occupation as a stock broker and motivational speaker.  According to a recent interview "Spitz became a stockbroker in 2002 and has since moved into private equity. He is now also dabbling in the "water business," as he calls it, and is in negotiations to build a water-bottling facility on aquifer-rich land that he and a business partner own.  , He has pursued various entrepreneurial projects with former NBA player Rick Barry . He travels the world delivering about 25 lectures a year. His biography, The Extraordinary Life of An Olympic Champion by Richard J. Foster, was released in July 2008.  , In July 2012 he endorsed Istanbul 's bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympics .  , His hobbies include sailing, skiing and collecting art.  (Print) , In an era when other swimmers, male and female, were shaving body hair, he swam with a moustache. When asked why he initially grew one he stated "I grew the moustache because a coach in college said I couldn't grow one."  Spitz said he originally grew the moustache as a form of rebellion against the clean-cut look imposed on him in college. "It took a long time to grow," he said.  It took four months to grow, but Spitz was proud of it, he decided the moustache was a "good-luck piece."  , Mark Spitz is quoted as saying, "When I went to the Olympics, I had every intention of shaving the moustache off, but I realized I was getting so many comments about it—and everybody was talking about it—that I decided to keep it. I had some fun with a Russian coach who asked me if my moustache slowed me down. I said, 'No, as a matter of fact, it deflects water away from my mouth, allows my rear end to rise and make me bullet-shaped in the water, and that's what had allowed me to swim so great.' He's translating as fast as he can for the other coaches, and the following year every Russian male swimmer had a moustache."  , According to a Sports Illustrated article, on February 14, 1988, after talking about shaving off his moustache for a year, he finally did. "He looked great with it, don't get me wrong," explained his wife Suzy, "but he looks so handsome without it."  , When he was asked why he shaved it off he responded "well, one, I'm not swimming anymore; two, it started to turn gray; and three, my wife had never seen me, nor my family, without the moustache . . . I'm happy [without it]."  He also commented on his moustache in a live, in-studio interview with KCRA host Mike TeSelle on June 14, 2008, Spitz commented that he no longer maintains his iconic moustache because it had become "too gray." , After retirement, Spitz was diagnosed with acid reflux disease , a condition from which his physician thinks he suffered throughout his career.  "During my Olympic training, I attributed the symptoms [of acid reflux] to an overexposure to chlorine and eating too soon before and after swimming," says Spitz. "It wasn't until the symptoms began to get in the way of my 1976 Olympic broadcasting career in Montreal, which was four years after retirement that I suspected something more serious must be happening." , He has also reported having high cholesterol and other chronic health issues.  "People don't believe that I have high cholesterol, but it's a fact," said Spitz. "I take medication every day because my doctor told me that diet and exercise are not enough to keep my cholesterol down." He is a paid spokesperson for Medco , a pharmacy benefit management company.  , In 1972, Spitz was accused of product placement during the medal ceremony. Following the 200-meter freestyle race Spitz arrived to obtain his gold medal barefoot and carrying his shoes. He put them down when the American national anthem, "The Star Spangled Banner" was played. After the anthem played, he picked up his shoes and waved to the crowd. The Soviets saw this as product placement. When questioned by the IOC, Spitz explained that the gesture was innocent, the shoes were old and he was not paid. The IOC cleared him of any wrongdoing.  , Spitz felt snubbed by not being asked to attend the 2008 Summer Olympics to watch Michael Phelps attempt to break his seven gold medal record. In an article, he is quoted as saying, "I never got invited. You don't go to the Olympics just to say, I am going to go. Especially because of who I am. . . . I am going to sit there and watch Michael Phelps break my record anonymously? That's almost demeaning to me. It is not almost—it is."  , Spitz has stated that he has no hard feelings towards Phelps. He is, however, unhappy that he was not invited to the 2008 Summer Olympics. As a result, Spitz refused to attend the games.  "They voted me one of the top five Olympians of all time. Some of them are dead. But they invited the other ones to go to the Olympics, but not me," he said. "Yes, I am a bit upset about it."  , However, on August 14, 2008 Spitz appeared on NBC's Today Show where he clarified his statement and his pride in Michael Phelps: , It's about time that somebody else takes the throne. And I'm very happy for him. I really, truly am...I was working with a corporate sponsor who elected not to bring their US contingent over to China, and they piled on more work for me here in the United States, which was great. So I wasn't able to get to the Olympics and watch Michael in the first couple of days. And they thought, some of these reporters, that I was supposed to be invited by some entity, and I told them that that wasn't really the case, that doesn't happen that way. And so, I'm sort of disappointed that I wasn't there, but, you know, that interview somehow took a different turn, and I've done hundreds and hundreds of them and I've been true to form about the way I feel about Michael, and he's doing a great job for the United States and inspiring a lot of great performances by the other team members.  , Also on August 14, 2008, in an interview aired on Los Angeles KNBC-4's morning news show, Today in L.A. , Spitz was quoted saying he does believe that, "Michael Phelps is the greatest Olympic athlete ever."  , On August 15, 2008, as part of an interview on NBC, Spitz said that he felt Phelps' performance in the 100 fly in Beijing was "epic". Spitz paid this compliment to Phelps just two hours after his record-tying seventh gold medal during a live joint interview with Bob Costas : , You know, Bob and Michael, I wondered what I was going to say at this monumental time, when it would happen and who I would say it to, and of course I thought I was going to say it to you for some time now. But, it's the word that comes to mind, "epic". What you did tonight was epic, and it was epic for the whole world to see how great you really are. I never thought for one moment that you were out of that race and contention, because I watched you at Athens win the race by similar margins, and 18 months ago at the World's by similar margins. And, you know, that is a tribute to your greatness. And now the whole world knows. We are so proud of you Michael here in America, and we are so proud of you and the way that you handle yourself, and you represent such an inspiration to all the youngsters around the world. You know, you weren't born when I did what I did, and I'm sure that I was a part of your inspiration, and I take that as a full compliment. And they say that you judge one's character by the company you keep, and I'm happy to keep company with you. And you have a tremendous responsibility for all those people that you are going to inspire over the next number of years, and I know that you will wear the crown well. Congratulations, Mike.  , On April 18, 2015 at the Laureus World Sports Awards Ceremony in Shanghai Spitz said he had been sent an email posted by Omega that had said Phelps had lost the 100m butterfly final. He also said that Phelps is still the greatest swimmer in the world, with or without that medal.  , Mark Spitz has been consistent in criticism of both swimming's world bodies, FINA and the IOC, in their incomplete attempts to keep drugs out of the sport. He has felt that not enough has been done to monitor and encourage drug-free participation. In 1998 he criticized FINA for its "embarrassing" attempts to stamp out drug abuse, urging them to test for all known drugs. In September 1999 Spitz said the IOC had the technology to test for a plethora of drugs but was refusing to do so because of some IOC member protests.  , During a radio interview in Australia, Spitz was quoted as saying "They don't want to test for everything because there's tremendous pressure from the television networks because they want the television to have athletic competitions with the world record holders there for the finals. They want the medals not to be tainted in their value of accomplishment by winning them, and it's all about ratings and commercial selling of time and about money. And an International Olympic Committee has got their hand in the pockets of the network television people, so there's a tremendous conflict of interest in what they should do and what they're doing."  , In August 2008, the Los Angeles Times reported, that Spitz continued to discuss drug testing and was saying "the IOC has sponsors who demand a good show. Television pays the IOC for the rights to that good show, and its sponsors want that too. Drug news and drug distractions are not a good show. People are not going to tune in to see athletes have their medals taken away from them."  , ,  Matthew Nicholas Biondi (born October 8, 1965) is an American former competition swimmer , eleven-time Olympic medalist, and former world record-holder in five events. Biondi competed in the Summer Olympic Games in 1984 , 1988 and 1992 , winning a total of eleven medals (eight gold, two silver and one bronze). During his career, he set thee individual world records in the 50-meter freestyle and four in the 100-meter freestyle. , At the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, Biondi won five gold medals, setting world records in the 50-meter freestyle and three relay events. , Biondi is a member of the International Swimming Hall of Fame and the United States Olympic Hall of Fame . , , , Biondi started his aquatics career as a swimmer and water polo player in his hometown of Moraga, California . As he moved into his teens, his incredible abilities as a sprint swimmer began to emerge. Though he did not start swimming year-round until he started at Campolindo High School , by his senior year Biondi was the top schoolboy sprinter in America with a national high school record of 20.40 seconds in the 50-yard freestyle. He accepted a scholarship to attend the University of California, Berkeley , to swim and play water polo, and enrolled in 1983. In his freshman year, he played on Berkeley's NCAA championship water polo team, and made the consolation finals at the 1984 NCAA swimming championships. , In the summer of 1984, Biondi surprised the swimming community by qualifying for a spot on the U.S. 4×100 meter freestyle relay at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics . The team won the gold medal in a world record time. Upon returning to Berkeley, Biondi once again played on an NCAA champion water polo team in the fall, and during in the winter of 1985, he won the first of his eight individual swimming titles at the NCAA championships. , Biondi was selected as the NCAA Swimmer of the Year in 1985, 1986, and 1987, and he set several American and NCAA records. , Biondi set the first of his twelve individual swimming world records in 1985. He was the first man to swim the 100-meter freestyle faster than 49 seconds, and by 1988 he owned the ten fastest times swum in that event. He won a total 24 U.S. Championships in the 50, 100, and 200 meter freestyle events, as well as the 100 butterfly. In two World Championships (1986 and 1991), Biondi won 11 medals including six gold. During his career, he was a finalist for the James E. Sullivan Award , the UPI Sportsman of the Year, the U.S. Olympic Committee Sportsman of the Year, and selected twice as the Swimming World magazine Male Swimmer of the World, in 1986 and 1988. , Biondi was involved in perhaps one of the oddest defeats of any competitor at the 1988 Seoul Olympics . In the 100-meter butterfly final race, he was caught between strokes as he approached the finishing wall. He chose to glide rather than take another stroke, and Biondi was edged out by Anthony Nesty of Surinam by just one one-hundredth (0.01) of second. , Biondi still won five gold medals, one silver medal, and one bronze medal in the 1988 Olympics, breaking the world records in four of those victories: three in relay races, and one in the 50 meter freestyle , taking just 22.14 seconds for this swim. This was the third time that he had broken or equalled the existing 50 meter freestyle world record.   , Biondi's time in the 100 meter freestyle final was the only swim below 49.00 seconds of the competition, and he set a new Olympic record of 48.63 seconds, the second fastest swim at this distance in history.  , At the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Biondi won two more gold medals in relays and a silver in the 50 meter freestyle. , Biondi competed at the World Championships in 1986 and 1991, winning six gold medals. , In 1986, he won three gold medals, one silver and three bronzes to set a record of seven medals at one World Championship meet. (This record has since been matched by Michael Phelps .) , Biondi graduated from the University of California, Berkeley , in 1988 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Economy of Industrialized Societies (PEIS). , Biondi married Kirsten Metzger in her home state of Hawaii in 1995. They have three children: their sons Nathaniel (Nate), born in 1998, and Lucas, born in 2002; and their daughter Makena, born in 2007. , Kirsten Biondi persuaded her husband to continue his education, and he earned his master's degree in education in 2000 at Lewis and Clark College in Portland, Oregon.  , In recent years, Biondi has worked as a school teacher and swimming coach in Hawaii. As of 2012, he has been hired to teach math and coach at Sierra Canyon School in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Chatsworth .  , Biondi has become active within the masters swimming community, launching an annual masters competition that bears his name. The Matt Biondi Masters Classic was held for the first time on March 24, 2014, in Simi Valley, California. The competition is a one-day, short course yards meet held in conjunction with Biondi's masters club, the Conejo Valley Multisport Masters.  , ,  Ryan Steven Lochte ( / ˈ l ɒ k t i / , LOCK -tee ; born August 3, 1984) is an American competitive swimmer and an 11-time Olympic medalist (five gold, three silver, three bronze). His seven individual Olympic medals ranks near the top in men's swimming. As part of the American team, he holds the world record in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay (long course). Individually, he currently holds the world record in the 100-meter individual medley, 200-meter individual medley (long and short course), and the 400-meter individual medley (short course). , Lochte's success has earned him the World Swimmer of the Year Award and the American Swimmer of the Year Award twice. He has also been named the FINA Swimmer of the Year three times. He has won a total of 77 medals in major international competition, 49 gold, 17 silver, and 11 bronze spanning the Olympics, the World , Pan American , and Pan Pacific Championships. , Lochte specializes in the backstroke and individual medley, but is also a freestyle and butterfly swimmer. He is noted for the speed and distance he attains while kicking underwater. Lochte is also known for his dominance in the short course format (25-yard and 25-meter long swimming pools). , , , Lochte was born in Rochester, New York , the son of Ileana "Ike" ( née Aramburu) and Steven R. Lochte.  His mother is of Spanish and Basque ancestry and was born and raised in Havana , while his father is of German , Dutch and English descent.  He has two older sisters, Kristin, and Megan, and two younger brothers, Devon, and Brandon. During his early childhood, his family lived in Canandaigua, New York , but moved to Florida so his father could coach swimming. Lochte was taught to swim at the age of five by both of his parents. Ryan was often kicked out of his father's swimming classes for misbehaving, which often included pulling other children's legs, blowing bubbles, and hiding at the other end of the pool. Lochte only began taking swimming seriously when he was a junior in high school.  Steve Lochte said, "I would send him to go shower when he was messing around. He spent more time in the showers than he did in the pool." At 14 years old, Ryan's loss at the Junior Olympics changed his attitude towards swimming: "I suddenly said, 'I'm sick of losing'. After that I trained hard and I never lost there again."  , Lochte attended the University of Florida and graduated in 2007, majoring in sport management .  As a member of the Florida Gators swimming and diving team, he swam for coach Gregg Troy in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and Southeastern Conference (SEC) competition from 2004 to 2007.

He also qualified for the 4×200-meter freestyle relay team after finishing 4th in the 200-meter freestyle final.  At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, Lochte swam with Phelps, Klete Keller , and Peter Vanderkaay to upset the Australian team and capture the gold medal in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay.

This was Lochte's first world record in a long course event.  A little more than 90 minutes later, Lochte went on to set a world record in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay with Phelps, Keller, and Vanderkaay.  He also won silver medals in the 100-meter backstroke, the 200-meter individual medley, and the 400-meter individual medley, making his medal total for the meet second only to Phelps.    , Within a week of the world championships, Lochte competed in the annual Mutual of Omaha Duel in the Pool where he again beat Peirsol. In the 100-meter backstroke, he broke Peirsol's other seven-year winning streak in the shorter of the backstroke races, edging out Peirsol by 0.06 seconds.  , At the 2008 U.S. Olympic Team Trials in Omaha, Nebraska, Lochte competed in six individual events and qualified to swim in three individual events at the 2008 Summer Olympics .

"Getting five gold medals is definitely great, but the times that I went, I know I could go a lot faster," he said. "There are a lot of places in my races that I messed up on that I could have changed and gone faster, but I guess I have a whole year to make sure I have those perfect swims."  , At year's end, Lochte was named the World Swimmer of the Year and American Swimmer of the Year by Swimming World Magazine , and defended his titles from 2010.

He also had a guest appearance on 90210 in late 2012.  Additionally, he showed interest in being a participant on Dancing with the Stars .  , What Would Ryan Lochte Do? began airing April 21, 2013 on E!  and was cancelled after only one season, five weeks later.  , Lochte's public persona and character have inspired a series of unflattering internet memes .  , Despite rumors in the Australian press linking Lochte with Australian swimmer Blair Evans ,    Lochte's mother, Ileana, confirmed to Us Weekly in a July 28, 2012, interview that her son was "too busy" to be in a relationship and stated that it "wouldn't be fair to the girl."  , On August 1, 2012, Lochte trademarked his personal catchphrase , "Jeah," with the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office .  , ,  For his father, also an Olympian, see Gary Hall, Sr. , Gary Wayne Hall, Jr. (born September 26, 1974) is an American former competition swimmer who represented the United States at the 1996 , 2000 , and 2004 Olympics and won ten Olympic medals (five gold, three silver, two bronze). He is a former world record-holder in two relay events. Hall is well known for his "pro-wrestling like" antics before a competition; frequently strutting onto the pool deck in boxing shorts and robe, shadow boxing and flexing for the audience. , , , His father, Gary Hall, Sr. , also competed in three Olympics as a swimmer (1968, 1972 and 1976). His maternal uncle, Charles Keating III , swam in the 1976 Olympics, and his maternal grandfather, Charles Keating Jr. , was a national swimming champion in the 1940s. , In his first Olympics at the age of 21 in Atlanta, Hall had only 6 years of swimming experience yet he already had a well-known rivalry with Russia's Alexander Popov . Hall and his teammates dominated the relay events, but Popov beat Hall in the individual events. The rivalry grew more bitter than ever. Hall responded by coming to his next event in leather motorcycle pants and executing his usual shadow boxing and flexing routine. Eventually, Hall lost in the individual 100 m freestyle and 50 m freestyle to Popov. , Hall won two individual silvers and two team relay golds at the games, including helping set the world record in both the 400 m freestyle and medley relays. , In 1998, Hall was suspended by FINA for marijuana use.  , In 1999, he was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes , commonly referred to as childhood or juvenile diabetes. Upon his diagnosis, Hall struggled with the possibilities and the effects he knew the medical condition would have on his life. He took a short hiatus from swimming, but returned to compete in the 2000 U.S. Olympic Trials. There he won the 50 m freestyle and placed second in the 100 m freestyle . His 50 m time of 21.76 seconds set a new American record, beating the ten-year-old record set by Tom Jager . , Hall's success continued in the 2000 Summer Olympics . He won the gold medal in the individual 50 m freestyle , tying with his fellow American Anthony Ervin , and won the gold and silver in the team relays. He also won the bronze in the individual 100 meter freestyle race. , Prior to the 4x100 m freestyle relay, Hall posted on his blog: "My biased opinion says that we will smash them (Australia's 4x100m team) like guitars. Historically the U.S. has always risen to the occasion. But the logic in that remote area of my brain says it won't be so easy for the United States to dominate the waters this time." Hall swam last in the team against Australian Ian Thorpe . Thorpe had a better start and came up a body length in front of Hall. Hall managed a lead but Thorpe fought back, inflicting America's first ever Olympic defeat in the event. The Australian team responded to Hall's remarks after the race by playing air guitar on the pool deck. Hall recalled the race, saying, “I don’t even know how to play the guitar...I consider it the best relay race I’ve ever been part of. I doff my cap to the great Ian Thorpe. He had a better finish than I had.”  , At the 2004 Summer Olympics , Hall again won the gold medal in 50 m freestyle . At 29, he became the oldest American male Olympic swimmer since 1924 when Duke Kahanamoku competed. Despite having swum the fastest 50 in the year leading up to the 2004 Summer Olympics , he was regarded as a long shot to medal in the 50 m freestyle. He also won a bronze medal for competing in the preliminary heat of the 4×100 meter freestyle relay. , Hall failed to qualify for the 2008 Olympic Team after finishing 4th in the 50 Meter Finals at the US Olympic Swimming Trials (Located in Omaha, Nebraska) on July 5, 2008. , The Race Club is a swimming club founded by Hall and his father, Gary Hall, Sr. The club, originally known as "The World Team," was designed to serve as a training group for elite swimmers across the world in preparation for the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games. To be able to train with the Race Club, one must either have been ranked in the top 20 in the world the past 3 calendar years or top 3 in their nation in the past year. The Race Club included such well known swimmers as Roland Mark Schoeman , Mark Foster , Ryk Neethling , Ricky Busquet and Therese Alshammar .  They were coached by University of Michigan coach Mike Bottom . , The Race Club offers various swimming camps, swim clinics, and swimming technique video recording year round for young swimmers at their Islamorada, Florida -based training center.  , In the summer of 2006, Hall's sister, Bebe Hall, was attacked by a blacktip reef shark near Islamorada , while she and Gary were spearfishing , an attack for which Bebe Hall needed 19 stitches .  Gary Hall repeatedly punched the shark and his sister shot a spear into it, after which the shark swam off. , Hall has long been one of competitive swimming's most colorful personalities. He often shadow-boxes before a race and is known for wearing a boxing robe in lieu of the usual warm-ups. His eccentricity has won him a great deal of fans, but what some perceive to be "showboating" has drawn substantial criticism. He is also an outspoken critic of performance enhancing drug use in swimming, and is one of the few prominent swimmers willing to publicly question the legitimacy of suspected individual accomplishments. In 2008, he compared International Swimming Hall of Fame inductee Amy Van Dyken to disgraced track & field athlete Marion Jones , noting they were both involved with the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative (BALCO) steroid scandal. [1]  Ian James Thorpe , OAM (born 13 October 1982) is an Australian swimmer who specialises in freestyle , but also competes in backstroke and the individual medley . He has won five Olympic gold medals, the most won by any Australian, and with three gold and two silver medals, was the most successful athlete at the 2000 Summer Olympics . At the 2001 World Aquatics Championships , he became the first person to win six gold medals in one World Championship.  In total, Thorpe has won eleven World Championship golds, the third-highest number of any swimmer.  Thorpe was the first person to have been named Swimming World Swimmer of the Year four times,   and was the Australian Swimmer of the Year from 1999 to 2003. His athletic achievements made him one of Australia's most popular athletes, and he was recognised as the Young Australian of the Year in 2000.  , At the age of 14, he became the youngest male ever to represent Australia,  and his victory in the 400 metre freestyle at the 1998 Perth World Championships made him the youngest ever individual male World Champion.  After that victory, Thorpe dominated the 400 m freestyle, winning the event at every Olympic, World, Commonwealth and Pan Pacific Swimming Championships until his break after the 2004 Olympics .  Aside from 13 individual long-course world records, Thorpe anchored the Australian relay teams, numbering the victories in the 4 × 100 m and the 4 × 200 m freestyle relays in Sydney , among his five relay world records. His wins in the 200 m and 400 m and his bronze in the 100 m freestyle in Athens have made him the only male to have won medals in the 100–200–400 combination.  , After the Athens Olympics, Thorpe took a year away from swimming, scheduling a return for the 2006 Commonwealth Games . However, he was forced to withdraw due to illness. Subsequent training camps were interrupted, and he announced his retirement in November 2006, citing waning motivation.  From early 2011, there was speculation about Thorpe's return to swimming, fuelled by people claiming to have seen him training. The speculations were substantiated when Thorpe spoke at a February 2011 press conference of his return to swimming after four years away, with the aim of competing in the 2012 London Olympic Games .   Thorpe competed at Australia's Olympic Trials in 2012, but failed to make the team. It was subsequently announced that he was targeting qualification for the 2013 World Championships in Barcelona  and later the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow  but was forced to abandon his plans due to a shoulder injury.  In 2014, he was presented with a Doctor of Letters from Macquarie University in recognition of his extraordinary contribution for the sport, philanthropy and Indigenous rights.  , , , Born in Sydney, Thorpe grew up in the suburb of Milperra and hailed from a sporting family.  His father Ken was a promising cricketer at junior level, representing Bankstown District Cricket Club in Sydney's district competition .    A talented batsman , he once topped the season's batting averages ahead of former Australian captain Bob Simpson . However, paternal pressure detracted from Ken's enjoyment of cricket, and he retired at the age of 26.  Thorpe's mother Margaret played A-grade netball ,   but he did not inherit his parents' ball skills.  His elder sister Christina was advised to take up swimming to strengthen a broken wrist, so by chance, the five-year-old Thorpe followed her into the pool.    Due to his unhappy experiences, Ken Thorpe regarded enjoyment as the most critical aspect of his children's participation in sport.  A large baby, Thorpe weighed 4.1 kg (9.0 lb) and measured 59 cm (1 ft 11 in) in length at birth.  , As a young child, Thorpe was sidelined by an allergy to chlorine .  As a result, he did not swim in his first race until a school carnival at the age of seven.  The allergy forced Thorpe to swim with his head out of the water; despite this ungainly technique, he won the race, primarily because of his significant size advantage.    Thorpe gradually overcame the ailment and progressed to the captaincy of New South Wales for the Australian Primary Schools Championships in 1994.  He subsequently won nine individual gold medals at the New South Wales Short Course Age Championships in September of the same year.  In 1995, Thorpe started his secondary education at East Hills Boys Technology High School   and switched coaches to swim alongside his sister under the tutelage of Doug Frost .  It was a busy year for the family; Christina was selected for the Australian team to compete at the 1995 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Atlanta .  Now six feet tall, Ian competed at his first Australian Age Championships, winning bronze medals in the 200 m and 400 m freestyle. He won all ten events at the New South Wales Age Championships.    , Thorpe competed at the 1996 Australian Age Championships in Brisbane , winning five gold, two silver and two bronze medals.  His times in the 400 m freestyle and 200 m backstroke qualified him for the Australian Championships,  which doubled as selection trials for the 1996 Atlanta Olympics . Frost knew that Thorpe had no realistic chance of making the top two in any event, which would have meant Olympic selection at only 13 years and six months. He sent Thorpe to Sydney merely to gain competition experience at senior national level.  As expected, Thorpe missed selection; he finished 23rd in the 400 m freestyle and 36th in the 200 m backstroke.  At the end of the year, Thorpe qualified for the Australian Short Course Championships. It was another chance to gain national selection, as the event served as the selection trials for the 1997 FINA World Swimming Championships (25 m) . Thorpe qualified in second place in the heats of the 400 m individual medley to reach his first national final.  However, he swam more slowly in the final and missed selection.  , At the New South Wales Championships in January 1997, Thorpe's time of 3 min 59.43 s in the 400 m was eight seconds faster than his previous personal best;  it made him the first 14-year-old to cover the distance in less than four minutes on Australian soil. Ranked fourth for the event countrywide,  Thorpe went into the Australian Championships in Adelaide as a serious contender for selection in the national team for the 1997 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Fukuoka , Japan. With a top-three finish and a specific qualifying time required for selection, Thorpe focused on the 400 m freestyle after injuries to world record holder Kieren Perkins and Daniel Kowalski ; both had won Olympic medals in the event. Thorpe went on to win bronze behind 16-year-old Queenslander Grant Hackett , setting a new personal best of 3 min 53.44 s.  The time was a world record for his age group and the race was the first of many battles with Hackett.  , Aged 14 years and 5 months, Thorpe became the 463rd  and youngest ever male to be selected for the Australian team,   surpassing John Konrads ' record by one month.  Frost said that Thorpe's selection catalysed his eventual focus on freestyle. Thorpe continued his good form at the Australian Age Championships. He contested all twelve events, winning ten individual gold and two bronze medals.  He set six Australian records in the process.   , In June 1997, two months before the Pan Pacific Championships , Thorpe required an appendix operation, which caused him to miss two weeks of training.  Upon reaching Japan, Thorpe placed fourth in his heat of the 200 m freestyle with a new personal best time of 1 min 51.46 s.  Thorpe's time was not enough to qualify for the final, but earned him selection in the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay team. Along with teammates Michael Klim , Ian van der Wal and Hackett, Thorpe claimed silver, making him the youngest ever Pan Pacific medalist.  In his first individual final at international level, Thorpe was fifth at the 300 m mark, but fought back to claim silver in the 400 m freestyle behind Hackett in a time of 3 min 49.64 s.     His finishing burst was to become a trademark, and his time would have been enough to win silver at the Atlanta Olympics .   In October 1997, a few days before his fifteenth birthday, Thorpe competed in qualifying trials in Brisbane for the 1998 World Aquatics Championships in Perth . Thorpe gained selection for the world championships by finishing fourth and second in the 200 m and 400 m freestyle respectively. He set new personal bests in both events.  , Thorpe's first international appearance in his home country, at the 1998 World Championships in Perth, began with the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay . Swimming the third leg after Klim and Hackett, Thorpe broke away from 200 m butterfly Olympic champion Tom Malchow to set a split time of 1 min 47.67 s, just 0.26 seconds slower than Klim's winning time in the 200 m final .  By the end of Thorpe's leg, the Australians were two seconds ahead of the world record pace, and three seconds ahead of the Americans, having extended the lead by two body lengths. Although anchorman Kowalski finished outside the world record,  it was the first time that Australia had won the event at the global level since 1956 .  Thorpe was ranked fourth in the world before the 400 m final , which Hackett led from the outset. Hackett established a comfortable 2.29 s lead over Thorpe by the 300 m mark, and although Thorpe reduced the margin to 1.53 s at the 350 m mark, Hackett led until Thorpe passed him on the final stroke.  Thorpe's time was the fourth fastest in history and made him the youngest ever male individual world champion, aged 15 years and 3 months.     , As a result of the media attention generated by his win on home soil, Thorpe received multiple offers for television commercials and was often surrounded by autograph hunters.  He became a high-profile supporter of the Children's Cancer Institute , after his sister Christina's future brother-in-law Michael Williams became gravely ill with cancer.   , Thorpe's next competition was in March at the Australian Championships in Melbourne, which were selection trials for the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Malaysia. Thorpe's improvement continued when he defeated Klim in the 200 m freestyle in 1 min 47.24 s, faster than Klim's winning time at the World Championship two months earlier.  Thorpe's time was a Commonwealth record  and with it, he secured his first national title. He then claimed the 400 m freestyle title from Hackett and clocked 50.36 s in the 100 m freestyle. His time earned silver in his first 100 m race at the national level, gaining him Commonwealth selection in three individual events.  , Thorpe's rise continued when the Australians arrived in Kuala Lumpur during September for the Commonwealth Games. Thorpe's first event was the 200 m freestyle, where he led throughout to record a time just one hundredth of a second outside Giorgio Lamberti 's world record.  He then combined with Klim, Kowalski and Matt Dunn in the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay to break the world record of the Unified Team set in 1992 by 0.09 s.  Thorpe's run ended when a personal best of 50.21 s in the 100 m freestyle was only sufficient for fourth place, but he returned to victory with the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay team.  He claimed a fourth gold in the 400 m freestyle, setting another personal best, just 0.55 s slower than Kieren Perkins' 1994 mark.      , Thorpe left school at the end of the year after completing Year 10 . His decision caused concerns that concentrating on swimming alone could lead to burn out.  Thorpe disagreed, pointing to his informal search for knowledge, stating that "Swimming is a small part of my life".  His impact in the swimming community was acknowledged when he became the youngest male swimmer to be named as the Swimming World Swimmer of the Year .  , 1999 began with heavy media expectations that Thorpe would inevitably break both 200 m and 400 m world records, given his continuing physical growth. The first opportunity came in late March at the 1999 Australian Championships in Brisbane, which doubled as a selection event for the 1999 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships . Thorpe again won the 400 m, but Perkins' record eluded him, this time by just 0.05 s.  Hackett turned the tables in the 200 m event, passing Thorpe in the final 50 m to win Thorpe's title.  Although both were outside Lamberti's mark, Hackett went on to break it the following night in a relay event.   Thorpe finished the Championships by continuing his improvement in the 100 m freestyle, posting a time of 49.98 s, his first under the 50 s barrier. The Australian team then travelled to Hong Kong for the 1999 World Short Course Championships , where Thorpe broke Lamberti's mark in the 200 m freestyle, the longest standing world record at the time. However, Hackett defeated him in the 400 m.   This was the start of a three-year phase where Thorpe was to set his 13 individual long course world records. He led the men's relay team to unprecedented success in relay events, scoring historic victories over the Americans. Thorpe was to peak in 2001 when he became the first person to win six gold medals at one world championships, setting three world records and helping Australia top the medal tally at a global meet for the first time since 1956. In this period, he was named Swimming World Swimmer of the Year three times.    , The 1999 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships were held in August at Sydney Olympic Park , and were viewed as a rehearsal for the 2000 Summer Olympics to be held in the same venue. With Thorpe expected to deliver world records at his first international meet in Sydney, the event was shown live on Australian television for the first time. The opening night saw him pitted against Hackett and South Africa's Ryk Neethling in the 400 m freestyle final.  The trio reached the 200 m mark in a group, on world record pace, before Thorpe broke away, recording a split time 1.86 s ahead of world-record pace at 300 m. He extended his lead to four body lengths by the 350 m mark and finished in a time of 3 min 41.83 s, cutting almost two seconds from the world record,    and covering the second half in almost the same time as the first.   Talbot reacted to the performance by dubbing Thorpe as "the greatest swimmer we've [Australia] ever had",  whilst four-time American Olympic gold medalist Rowdy Gaines , commentating for NBC , said "...he went into a balls-out sprint at 250 – and I have never seen anything like that...I have been around swimming a long time and it's the most amazing swim I've ever seen, hands down."   A formula used by the International Swimming Statisticians Association to compare world records in different events gave his performance the highest score of all current world records.  Thorpe promptly donated the A$ 25,000 prizemoney for breaking the first world record in the pool to charity.     Later the same night, Thorpe anchored the Australians to a historic victory in the 4 × 100 m freestyle final,   the first time the United States had lost the event. Thorpe set an Australian record relay split of 48.55 s. Even taking into account a 0.6–0.7 s for a flying relay start, his split time was almost 1 s faster than his individual best of 49.98 s.  It was to be the first of many occasions in which he would anchor the Australian relay teams to victory over the Americans, with splits consistently faster than his equivalent individual times.  The following night, in the semi-finals of the 200 m freestyle , Thorpe broke Hackett's world record by 0.33 s, clocking 1 min 46.34 s.   The next day in the final, he again broke the record,  lowering it to 1 min 46.0 s.    He finished his competition by leading off the 4 × 200 m freestyle team with Klim, Hackett and Bill Kirby to victory. Their time lowered their own world record by more than three seconds, completing Thorpe's fourth world record in four nights.       , Immediately after the Pan Pacific Championships, Thorpe's management announced his signing to Adidas for an undisclosed six-figure sum, stating that he would race in their new bodysuit. This presented a dilemma, as the national team was sponsored and wore outfits designed by Speedo , leading to months of protracted discussions and uncertainty.  To compound his commercial difficulties, Thorpe had an uncertain end to the sporting year when, in October, he broke a bone in his ankle whilst jogging.  However his performance throughout the year was recognised when he was again named as the World Swimmer of the Year by Swimming World , and by Swimming Australia as its Swimmer of the Year. In a wider arena, he was named Young Australian of the Year ,  ABC Sports Star of the Year, and Male Athlete of the Year at the Australian Sports Awards.    , Thorpe started 2000 looking to add a third individual event to his Olympic schedule. He explored his options by contesting the 1500 m freestyle at the New South Wales Championships in January, which he won.  Thorpe embarked on a European FINA World Cup tour in order to hone his racecraft, but this was overshadowed by comments made by German head coach Manfred Thiesmann accusing him of using steroids .    Thorpe's difficulties heightened at the subsequent German leg of the tour in Berlin, when a standoff over a drug-test arose when officials wanted to take an unsealed sample due to lack of containers. After the standoff was resolved,    Thorpe proceeded to cut more than 1.5 s from his world short course record in the 200 m freestyle.  Given the context of the race, Thorpe rated it as his best-ever performance, ahead of his victories at Olympic and World level.    On returning from Europe, Thorpe faced further uncertainty until he was granted permission to wear his Adidas suit instead of the Australian uniforms provided by Speedo.  , With the past uncertainties resolved, Thorpe proceeded to the Olympic selection trials at Sydney Olympic Park in May 2000. He again broke his 400 m world record on the first night of racing,  lowering it to 3 min 41.33 s to earn his first Olympic selection.    The following day, he lowered his 200 m world record to 1 min 45.69 s in the semi-finals,    before lowering it again to 1 min 45.51 s in the final.     His attempt to secure a third individual berth failed after he finished fourth in the final of the 100 m and withdrew from the 1500 m.    , Thorpe's success led to allegations of drug doping in 2000, which arose again in 2007. Specifically he was accused of using banned performance-enhancing steroids . Prior to the 2000 Olympics, the head coach and captain of Germany's swimming team accused Thorpe of cheating, that his physical attributes were symptomatic of steroid use and that his ability to exceed prior records believed to be drug-fuelled made his feats worthy of suspicion.   In 2007, the French sports newspaper L'Équipe claimed that Thorpe "showed 'abnormal levels' of two banned substances in a doping test".   Thorpe denied the charges and the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA) confirmed that they had investigated Thorpe in the past, for abnormal levels of testosterone and luteinising hormone (LH), but had dismissed the result.   FINA dropped its investigation and closed the case.  Thorpe has never been found to have been doping, and has steadfastly denied the allegations while also being prominent in the campaign against drug use. He has called for the introduction of blood testing, promised to surrender a frozen sample for retrospective testing and repeatedly criticised FINA for drug-testing procedures that he regards as inadequate.    , Entering the Olympics, the Australian public expected Thorpe to deliver multiple world records and gold medals as a formality; Sydney's Daily Telegraph posted a front-page spread headlined Invincible .   Thorpe cruised through the heats of the 400 m on the first morning of competition, posting a new Olympic record and shortening bookmakers' odds to 50–1.    By the time the final was held that night, the pressure had intensified—the host nation had yet to win its first gold medal. Thorpe led throughout, and although Italy's Massimiliano Rosolino was within a body length at the 300 m mark, Thorpe's finishing kick extended the final margin to three body lengths.  This set a new world record of 3 min 40.59 s.   Secret tests carried out by the Italian National Olympic Committee prior to the Olympics later showed that Rosolino had abnormal levels of human growth hormone.   Rosolino aside, Thorpe had left bronze medallist Klete Keller fifteen metres in arrears.  , Thorpe lined up later in the night alongside Klim, Chris Fydler and Ashley Callus to anchor the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay , an event which the Americans had never lost at Olympic level. The third leg ended with Australia only an arm's length ahead of the United States.  Thorpe timed his dive much better than Gary Hall, Jr. , and surfaced a body length ahead. Hall's sprinting ability allowed him to open a lead by the final turn,   but Thorpe's finishing kick overhauled him in the final metres, sparking wild celebrations amongst the partisan crowd.    It evoked an uncharacteristic celebration from Thorpe, who immediately jumped out of the pool, screaming and hugging his ecstatic teammates. He even went as far as playing air guitar to mock Hall's pre-race claim that the Americans would "smash" the Australians "like guitars".    , When Thorpe broke the 200 m freestyle Olympic record in the heats the following morning,  his main rival Pieter van den Hoogenband of the Netherlands (with World #2 ranked and teammate Michael Kim bypassing the 200 metres) conceded defeat.   However, van den Hoogenband showed his hand in the semi-finals by cutting more than a second off his personal best, to set a new world record of 1 min 45.35 s. Thorpe qualified second with a personal best of his own, 0.02 s slower,   and was under immense pressure to win the final the following day after his double gold on the first night.   Van den Hoogenband started quickly and Thorpe chased him, reaching the 100 m mark just 0.04 s behind. Both swimmers turned at 150 m in identical times. As a result of starting harder than usual, Thorpe faded as van den Hoogenband drew away to claim gold and equal his world record, stunning the home crowd. Thorpe touched in 1 min 45.83 s, the first time that he had swum slower in the final than in the qualifying rounds.    Thorpe though would never again lose to Van Den Hoogenband in a long course 200 metres race again. Thorpe returned to victory when he led off the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay the following night, setting up a 10 m lead over American Scott Goldblatt in the first leg. Although Thorpe was unable to reclaim the individual world record,  he, Klim, Kirby and Todd Pearson lowered their world record to 7 min 07.05 s,  over five seconds ahead of the Americans—the largest winning margin in an Olympic relay for half a century.   Thorpe rounded off his Olympics by swimming in the heats of the 4 × 100 m medley relay , and collected a silver medal when the finals quartet finished behind the Americans.    Thorpe's performances as Australia's leading medalist for the Games were recognised when the Australian Olympic Committee granted him the honour of carrying the flag at the closing ceremony .    With three gold and two silver medals, Thorpe was the most successful athlete at the 2000 Olympic Games. At year's end, he was again named by Swimming Australia as the Swimmer of the Year, but van den Hoogenband usurped him as the leading male swimmer chosen by Swimming World Magazine .  , With the 2001 Australian Championships held in Hobart in March, Thorpe added the 800 m freestyle to his repertoire, after FINA had added the event for the 2001 World Aquatics Championships .  Thorpe began his campaign by successfully defending his 400 m title with a time just 0.17 s outside his world record.    The following night in the 800 m event, he drew away from Hackett in the last 100 m to break Kieren Perkins ' 1994 world record by over four seconds.     He earned his third title by cutting 0.66 s from van den Hoogenband's 200 m world record to set a new mark of 1 min 44.69 s.    This performance made him the third male after John Konrads and Tim Shaw to hold world records over three distances simultaneously.  His subsequent victory in the 100 m freestyle in a new personal best of 49.05 s made him the first since Konrads in 1959 to hold all Australian freestyle titles from 100 m to 800 m.   This indicated that he could swim faster at the subsequent World Championships in Fukuoka , where he was looking to regain the ascendancy from van den Hoogenband.     , Thorpe arrived in Fukuoka having been chosen by broadcaster TV Asahi as the marketing drawcard of the event.  With the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay being held after the 400 m freestyle on the first night, Thorpe appeared to be conserving energy when he reached the 200 m mark two seconds outside his world record. Although he was 0.93 s behind at the final turn, a final 50 m burst in 24.36 s saw him cut a further 0.42 s from his world record.   The relay saw him dive in fractionally ahead of American Jason Lezak after Klim, Callus and Pearson had completed the first three legs. Thorpe fell behind in the early half of the leg before kicking away in the closing stages, to seal gold with his fastest-ever relay split of 47.87 s.   In the 800 m final , he shadowed Hackett for the first 750 m, staying within a body length. He then broke clear to win by a body length, lowering his world record by over two seconds.    The 200 m freestyle rematch with van den Hoogenband provided Thorpe with a chance to rectify his strategy from the Olympics; this time he allowed the Dutchman to lead through the first 100 m. Thorpe pulled even at the 150 m mark and then broke away towards the finishing wall two body lengths clear. He lowered his world record to 1 min 44.06 s in the process, prompting van den Hoogenband to raise his arm aloft.    Thorpe's winning streak was interrupted in the 100 m freestyle when his personal best of 48.81 s placed him fourth,  but he returned to form in the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay . Anchoring the team of Klim, Hackett and Kirby, the Australians lowered their world record time by more than two seconds, leaving the Italians more than six seconds in arrears.   Having overtaken Klim as Australia's leading 100 m freestyle swimmer, Thorpe was entrusted with anchoring the 4 × 100 m medley relay team on 28 July. After Matt Welsh , Regan Harrison and Geoff Huegill had finished their legs, Thorpe's change left him half a body length behind the new 100 m world champion Anthony Ervin of the United States. The Americans were expected to win, and with his typically slow start, Thorpe turned a body length behind with 50 m remaining. With an American victory seeming inevitable, Thorpe managed to accelerate and deprive Ervin of the lead in the last 5 m.    This made Thorpe the only swimmer to have won six gold medals at a World Championships,   and the first since Shaw in 1974 to win the 200–400–800 treble.  His performances formed the basis for Australia's gold medal win over the United States 13–9. It was also the first time since the 1956 Summer Olympics that Australia had topped the medal tally at a global meet.  Thorpe's achievements led to predictions that he could match Mark Spitz 's seven gold medals at the 1972 Summer Olympics , which he played down.  , Thorpe began competition in 2002 at the Australian Championships in Brisbane in March, which were used to select the team for the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester and the 2002 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships . After his record six gold medals in Fukuoka, the meet was surrounded by further expectations of world records and speculation that he would match Spitz 's seven gold medals.  His winning time in the 400 m was the second fastest in history, but such was the expectation on him that his failure to break a world record was the talking point.  He claimed the 100 m and 200 m events in times outside his best, making it the first time that he had failed to break a world record at a major meet since 1999.  He also experimented by adding the 100 m backstroke to his repertoire, placing second.  This earned him a Commonwealth spot in a seventh event, leading to further media speculation that he could match Spitz.  , By this time, Thorpe's relationship with Frost was beginning to unravel. Thorpe had always insisted that his swimming was about enjoyment and improving himself in setting faster times, rather than victory or defeat. This contrasted with Frost, who had a more aggressive and combative mindset, often making bold public statements.  Thorpe ignored Frost's advice and bulked up his upper body by a further 5 kg to 105 kg, making him the heaviest elite swimmer in history.  His reasoning that the strength gains would outweigh any loss in flexibility raised concerns over his physiological strategy.  On the first night in Manchester, Thorpe again lowered his 400 m mark by 0.09 s to 3 min 40.08 s,    before anchoring the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay team to another gold.    Prior to the 200 m final, Thorpe was seen arguing with Frost in the warm-up area. Thorpe won, but was unusually angry at having failed to lower his previous best, publicly stating that he "wasn't with it" and that he had "one of the worst warm-ups ever".    Thorpe did manage to lower his personal best in the 100 m freestyle to 48.73 s en route to his fourth gold, and anchored the 4 × 200 m freestyle and 4 × 100 m medley relays to comfortable victories.    When he collected a silver in his first international race in the 100 m backstroke with another personal best behind world champion Matt Welsh ,  he was forced to rebuff media comparisons to Spitz. He emphasised personal performance, stating "I think it's a limiting attitude to be competing against other people when you can be challenging yourself".  Despite Thorpe's assertion that he could not match Spitz, Frost predicted that Thorpe could win nine golds at one Olympics.  In spite of the media disappointment, Thorpe's six gold medals equalled the record set by Susie O'Neill , completing all in Games or World record time.       As a result, he was awarded the honour of carrying the flag at the closing ceremony.   , The Pan Pacific Championships followed in Yokohama less than a month later, with media speculation about Thorpe and Frost overshadowing the racing.  Thorpe began his campaign with a victory over Hackett in the 400 m freestyle in a time five seconds outside his world record. Afterwards, he revealed that both he and Hackett had deliberately conserved energy for the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay later in the night.  Australia subsequently won the relay, with Thorpe again overtaking Jason Lezak in the last 50 m.   He subsequently won the 200 m freestyle , and anchored the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay to victory to take his tally to four golds.   After qualifying second in the 100 m freestyle , Thorpe came from fourth at the 50 m mark win his fifth gold in a time of 48.84 s.    Thorpe's run ended in the 4 × 100 m medley relay final, when despite setting the second fastest ever relay split of 47.20 s, Australia were defeated.   , After the 2002 Pan Pacific Championships, Thorpe announced that he was splitting with Frost to train with one of his assistants, Tracey Menzies , who had no prior international experience. Admitting that tension existed between him and Frost, Thorpe asserted that the split was amicable. He cited waning motivation for the split, stating "I decided I either had to make the change or it was to walk away from the sport".  The retired Talbot expressed concerns that Thorpe was making a decision whilst he was physically and emotionally drained, while other coaches felt that the new relationship would end up with Thorpe, rather than Menzies, making the decisions.    Despite a turbulent year, he was again named by Swimming World as its World Swimmer of the Year.  , Along with the switch of coaches, Thorpe indicated that he would put more focus on improving his sprinting ability. He thus dropped the 800 m freestyle despite being the reigning world champion and record holder.  During this period, his times in the 400 m and 200 m freestyle deteriorated, and both he and Menzies were criticised. The criticism continued to mount during their partnership, particularly during the build-up to the 2004 Olympics. Following his victory in the 200 and 400 events in Athens, Thorpe said that his results justified his decision, despite posting substantially faster times as a young swimmer under Frost.  , The first major test of Thorpe's partnership with Menzies came at the Australian Championships held in Sydney in March. Thorpe did not threaten any of his world records, completing the 400 m and 200 m freestyle more than two and one seconds respectively off his best. Despite defeating Hackett in both races to retain his titles,  he later admitted that he was "pretty disappointed" with his performances.  When he tied with Ashley Callus in a time of 49.05 s,  he was criticised by The Sydney Morning Herald which stated "The measure of Thorpe's sprinting ability is that he could only match the efforts of a virus-riddled Callus".  Thorpe found some relief by setting a new Commonwealth record of 2 min 00.11 s in his first long course 200 m individual medley outing, the fifth fastest time in the past year.  Thorpe attracted further criticism when he withdrew from the inaugural Duel in the Pool with a medical complaint, despite travelling overseas for commercial and charity work.   , Thorpe arrived for the 2003 World Championships in Barcelona for his first major international competition since Menzies' appointment under heavy media scrutiny following his non-improvement at the Australian Championships. On the first night of competition Thorpe defeated Hackett in the 400 m freestyle in a time 2.5 s outside his world record,  making him the first to win three world titles in the same event.  After his relatively slow 400 m, he was again under pressure in the 200 m freestyle after van den Hoogenband led at the 100 m mark ahead of world record pace. Thorpe managed to respond and retain his world title,  and gained some relief after his sprint training yielded his first medal in the 100 m freestyle at a global competition; he finished third in 48.77 s.  In all three freestyle events however, he had swum slower than his times under Frost. He ended his individual campaign on a promising note with his experiment with the 200 m individual medley , setting a new personal best of 1 min 59.66 s to claim silver.  Thorpe again anchored the 4 × 200 m freestyle team to retain the world title along with Hackett, Nicholas Sprenger and Craig Stevens , with a reduced margin over the Americans, who finished less than two seconds in arrears.   Michael Klim 's injuries left the relay teams weakened, with Thorpe anchoring the 4 × 100 m freestyle team to fourth,   At the end of a difficult year in the water, his standing had fallen in the eyes of Swimming World , who rated him fourth in the world. He was again named as Australian Swimmer of the Year, jointly with Hackett.  , After his feats at the 2003 World Championships, Speedo had generated significant media publicity by offering Michael Phelps US$1 million if he could match Spitz's seven golds. Thorpe was adamant that this was impossible, and scrapped his seventh event, the 200 m individual medley from his Olympic program.  In late March 2004 at the Australian Championships in Sydney, Thorpe overbalanced whilst on the blocks in the heats of the 400 m freestyle and fell into the water, resulting in his disqualification and ending the defence of his Olympic 400 m title.  This resulted in a large debate among the swimming and public community as to whether Thorpe should be given an exception to Australia's policy of selecting the first and second place getters, with Prime Minister of Australia John Howard describing the situation as a "tragedy".  Despite the intense media spotlight, Thorpe managed to win the 100 m and 200 m freestyle events to ensure his selection for Athens. Craig Stevens , who had claimed the second qualifying position in the 400 m event, subsequently faced immense public pressure to relinquish his position to Thorpe, and later did so in a television interview for which he was paid.  This generated ethical debate as to whether Stevens' decision had been bought, and criticism against Thorpe.   , The pressure in the lead-up was further compounded by the media attention surrounding Phelps, who had decided that the 200 m freestyle would be one of the events in his quest for eight gold medals. This prompted many media outlets to label the race between Thorpe, van den Hoogenband, Phelps and Hackett as The Race of the Century . With the press spotlight growing, Thorpe tried to avoid media attention, resulting in a few terse media events.  Thorpe's increasing focus on the 100 m event, coupled with the media pressure, resulted in speculation that he was vulnerable to Hackett in the 400 m event . Thorpe made a slow start in the final, reaching the 100 m mark one second outside world record pace. In a topsy-turvy performance at irregular pace, there were multiple changes of lead before Thorpe established a body-length lead by 350 m. He was closed down by Hackett, holding on by only 0.26 s in a time three seconds outside his own world record. Thorpe appeared to shed tears in an uncharacteristic sign of emotion, admitting that the controversy surrounding the event had taken a toll on him, but denying that any liquid had left his eyes.   , With Klim recently returning from a two-year injury layoff, and Callus ill, Thorpe could only anchor Australia to sixth in the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay .  The 200 m began with van den Hoogenband again attacking immediately, reaching the 100 m mark more than a second under the world record split, with Thorpe half a body length behind. Thorpe gradually reduced the lead before passing van den Hoogenband in the last 50 m to win The Race of the Century by half a body length, in a new Olympic record of 1 min 44.71 s.  Having achieved what had eluded him four years earlier, Thorpe reacted emotionally, immediately tearing off his cap, punching the air and screaming.  The next day saw six years of Australian victory in the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay ended when Hackett, Klim and Sprenger had put Thorpe into the final leg 1.48 s behind Keller. Thorpe gradually reduced the margin but was unable to pass Keller in the last lap, the United States touching 0.13 s earlier.   Thorpe found himself on the other side of a close result when he qualified last for the 100 m freestyle by 0.01 s. He capitalised in the final by coming from sixth at the 50 m mark to win bronze medal in a personal best of 48.56 s,   making him the only person to medal in the 100–200–400 combination in Olympic history.  After the Athens Olympics, Thorpe took a break from competitive swimming, skipping the 2005 World Aquatics Championships . , Thorpe returned to competition at the New South Wales Championships in December 2005. He raced in the 200 m and stated his intention to retire after the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.  Thorpe announced that due to a desire to concentrate on the 100 m freestyle, he had dropped his pet event, the 400 m. He was unmoved by national coach Alan Thompson , who implored him to continue swimming the event.  In February, Thorpe qualified for the 2006 Commonwealth Games by winning the 100 m and 200 m freestyle in times of 49.24 s and 1 min 46.42 s respectively. He expressed disappointment with his performances; he speculated that he may have misjudged his new training schedule and anticipated further improvement.   , Soon after, Thorpe announced his withdrawal from the Commonwealth Games due to a bout of bronchitis , which had stopped him from training.   Thorpe's illness was later diagnosed as a strain of glandular fever ,  and after a further delay caused by a broken hand, he moved to the United States in July to work with Dave Salo . Further disruption followed when the Australian switched coaches, citing excessive and ongoing media attention.  Thorpe's stay was constantly surrounded by rumours that he was suffering from ill discipline; this fuelled speculation that his international career was on the decline.   , Upon his return to Australia, Thorpe withdrew from the selection trials for the 2007 World Championships and announced his retirement on 21 November 2006.  Thorpe said that he had been contemplating retirement for some time, but was afraid of the future because swimming had given him a "safety blanket".  Thorpe stated that he retired despite reaching higher levels of fitness, noting "As I got fit, physically fit, my mind also got fit".  He said a clear mind allowed him to reach his decision. He was close to tears when thanking the Australian public, but declared that his retirement was a "joyous" occasion of celebration.  , On 1 February 2011, Ian Thorpe announced that he would try to qualify for the 2012 Olympics in London. Thorpe's major focus was the 100 m and 200 m freestyle at 2012's trials, stating he could offer the most value to the Australian team in the relays. He would not swim the 400 m, claiming he would not have enough time to build up endurance for that event.  This led many to see a renewed rivalry with Michael Phelps. , Thorpe swam the 100 m butterfly and 100 m medley in Singapore (4–5 November) and Beijing (8–9 November) before also taking on the 100 m freestyle in the Tokyo (12–13 November) round of the 2011 FINA Swimming World Cup .  , Thorpe's comeback attempt in the 200 m freestyle came to an abrupt end on day 2 of Australia's Olympic Trials in Adelaide, on 16 March 2012. No longer allowed to wear the full-body racing suit (covering from neck to ankles and wrists) with which he set all of his world records – but are now banned by FINA rule changes  – he competed wearing just the "jammer" (hip to thigh) racing shorts. He swam very well in the morning heats, cruising to 1:49.18, a time which placed him equal fifth fastest. However, in the semi-finals that evening he faded over the last 100 meters, finishing in 12th place at 1:49.91. Speaking to reporters immediately afterwards, Thorpe said, "The last 100 was a struggle, I'm not sure why. This was slower than what I swam this morning, probably the inexperience of racing in the last 18 months held me up. The fairytale has turned into a nightmare."  In the 100 m freestyle on day 3 (17 March), Thorpe won his heat (the 9th of 12) but failed to break 50 seconds and did not advance to the semi-finals with the top 16 sprinters. Thus, his bid to qualify for the London Olympics officially ended. , Thorpe spoke to reporters after his 100 m race, saying: "When I started this I wanted to get back into the pool. I wanted to start racing again, I wanted to be competitive again and I wanted to go to the Olympics. I still want to do all of those things. I've missed out on what was a huge goal for me to accomplish in this short period of time, but still the desire I had previous to this, it's still there." Essentially saying that his (relatively) slow times in the 100 and 200 meters were the result of too short a period to train and prepare, Thorpe announced he will continue training, setting as his (new) goal qualifying for the World Championships in 2013. , During the 2012 Olympic Games, Thorpe worked as a pundit for BBC Television . , Thorpe's success has been attributed to his work ethic, mental strength, powerful kick, ability to accelerate and a physiology suited to swimming. This led former Australian head coach Don Talbot to label him as "the greatest swimmer the world has seen".  Although Swimming World labelled Thorpe's technique as "extraordinary" and "superior",  Talbot disagreed, stating his belief that Thorpe relied on his kick too heavily at the expense of his arms. He also cited Thorpe's ability to manage his workload and his day-to-day recovery between races during a meet as a deficiency.  Thorpe was known for using his trademark six-beat kick to power away from his rivals in the closing stages of races, the effectiveness of which was attributed to his unusually large size 17 feet.   , Following his retirement, head coach of the US men's swimming team Bob Bowman —who also mentors Michael Phelps —called Thorpe "the greatest middle-distance swimmer of all time and...the greatest relay swimmer I have seen".  Bowman further cited Thorpe's ability to raise the profile and popularity of swimming, noting that Phelps' public image was modelled on that of the Australian. Australian Olympic Committee President John Coates stated that "In 50 years from now Australians will still marvel at the feats of Ian Thorpe".  Dawn Fraser , the first of only two swimmers to win the same Olympic event three times, said that Thorpe was the "greatest [freestyle] swimmer in the world",   and lamented that he would not be attempting a hat-trick of 400 m titles.   , Aside from his swimming achievements, Thorpe has received numerous honours and accolades during his life. , In a July 2014 televised interview with British talk show host Michael Parkinson Thorpe came out as gay, after years of denying his homosexuality publicly.      He stated "I'm comfortable saying I'm a gay man. And I don't want people to feel the same way I did. You can grow up, you can be comfortable and you can be gay." He added "I am telling the world that I am gay … and I hope this makes it easier for others now, and even if you've held it in for years, it feels easier to get it out."   , Thorpe is known for his interests in fashion, and serves as an ambassador for Armani ,   and has his own line of designer jewellery and underwear.  During his career, Thorpe was one of the most prominent and popular sportspeople in Australia. Despite competing in a sport in which the vast majority of international athletes' earnings are below the poverty line,  marketing surveys consistently ranked Thorpe as the most sought-after Australian athlete for sponsorship deals, surpassing footballers who compete on a weekly basis in much larger stadia.  Aside from his swimsuit sponsor Adidas , Thorpe was sponsored by Australian corporate giants such as Qantas , Telstra , and the Seven Network .   , Thorpe's interests in fashion and culture led him to make frequent visits to New York City —which he describes as a second home—often for engagements with Armani and particularly because of the cities status as a global fashion capital.    He was present at the World Trade Center on the morning of 11 September 2001, having stopped there on his jog, before returning to his hotel after forgetting his camera.   It was during this trip that he appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno , which was notable because of the relative lack of interest in competitive swimming in America.   Thorpe later became a spokesperson for the unsuccessful New York bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics , even promising to continue his career until the games if New York won the hosting rights.  Thorpe's interests have also seen him involved in television. In 2002, he played the lead role in the reality television show Undercover Angels , which imitated the Charlie's Angels series. In the program, Thorpe directed three young women who performed good deeds for people in need.  Although it averaged more than a million viewers per episode, it was widely panned by critics.    Thorpe has also appeared as an extra in the American sitcom Friends .    , Thorpe is widely popular in Asia, particularly Japan. In 2000, TV Asahi identified him as the swimmer likely to be the most successful at the 2001 World Championships in Fukuoka, so they selected him as the event's marketing figurehead. In the lead-up, Thorpe visited Japan to promote Asahi in a series of television events,   and upon returning for the competition, he was mobbed at the airport by youthful crowds 25 m deep; hundreds camped outside the Australian team's hotel.   He was also praised by older sections of Japanese society as a role model for youth, due to what they interpreted as his humility and work ethic.   It was estimated that more than 80% of the Japanese public watched his races on television.  In 2002, in the wake of a tourism slump after 11 September terrorist attacks, Thorpe agreed to be an ambassador for the Australian Tourism Commission in Japan. The high-profile campaign included a meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi . The marketing drive resulted in an upturn in Japanese tourism to Australia, which was credited to Thorpe.     In 2005, Yakult released a 'Thorpedo' energy drink—which featured a picture of the swimmer on the bottle—in Japan.  This was part of an equity deal with the So Natural food group, in which Thorpe was given a 5% stake in the company—at the time worth A$1.1 m—in return for the use of his name and image on their products. The 15-year deal covers East and Southeast Asia and Thorpe's share in the venture could increase to 50% depending on its success.   , More recently, Thorpe has also emerged as a philanthropist, starting the Ian Thorpe's Fountain for Youth in 2000.   The organisation raises funds for research into childhood illnesses and sponsors a school in Beijing for orphaned children with disabilities.   In addition, it works with The Fred Hollows Foundation to improve health standards and living conditions in Australian aboriginal communities.    , In 2014, it was confirmed that Thorpe had been admitted to a rehabilitation clinic after neighbours found him dazed near his parents' Panania home. Thorpe was taken to Bankstown Hospital by police before being admitted to a rehabilitation clinic. In his 2012 autobiography This is Me , Thorpe stated he had considered suicide and had drunk 'huge quantities' of alcohol to deal with 'crippling depression'.   Aaron Wells Peirsol (born July 23, 1983) is an American former competition swimmer and backstroke specialist who is a former world champion and world record-holder. He is a three-time Olympian and seven-time Olympic medalist (five gold, two silver). As a member of the U.S. national team, he holds the world record in the men's 4×100-meter medley relay (long course). Individually, he currently holds the world record in the 100-meter and 200-meter backstroke events (long course). In February 2011, Peirsol announced his retirement, saying, "I ended up doing everything I set out to do." , Peirsol's successes have earned him the American Swimmer of the Year Award once. He has won a total of thirty-six medals in major international competition, twenty-nine gold, six silver, and one bronze spanning the Olympics, the World , Pan American , and the Pan Pacific Championships . , In his Olympic debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics , at the age of 17, Peirsol won a silver medal in the 200-meter backstroke. Four years later, at the 2004 Summer Olympics , Peirsol won gold in the 100-meter and 200-meter backstroke (sweeping the backstroke events) and the 4×100-meter medley relay. In his third Olympics ( 2008 Summer Olympics ), Peirsol won gold in the 100-meter backstroke and the 4×100-meter medley relay. He came short of his success he had in Athens by winning silver in the 200-meter backstroke, finishing behind Ryan Lochte . , , , Peirsol was born in Irvine, California , in 1983, the son of Scott and Wella Peirsol. His father is a captain and his mother is a retired dental hygienist . He has one younger sister, Hayley , who is also a swimmer. Peirsol and his sister are the only sibling duo to medal at the same FINA World Championships (in 2003). He is a 2002 graduate of Newport Harbor High School in Newport Beach, California . Peirsol attended the University of Texas at Austin and graduated in 2006, majoring in government. He was the 2003 NCAA Swimmer of the Year.  After finishing his second year of collegiate eligibility, Peirsol signed with Nike, Inc. , thus turning professional.  Peirsol trained under the guidance of Eddie Reese and Kris Kubik .  , Peirsol is also involved in a number of charities. He is an ambassador for the Global Water Foundation and the Surfrider Foundation .  He is also a spokesman for Oceana , which is the largest international ocean conservation and advocacy organization.  , Peirsol qualified for his first Olympics at the age of seventeen after finishing second to Lenny Krayzelburg in the 200-meter backstroke at the 2000 U.S. Olympic Team Trials.  Peirsol also competed in the 100-meter backstroke, but did not qualify for the event, finishing 4th.  At the 2000 Summer Olympics , Peirsol finished second to Krayzelburg in the 200-meter backstroke .  Afterwards Peirsol said, "I think I'm getting to a point where I'm becoming more of a threat to (Lenny) and I think he knows that."  , At the 2001 National Championships, with Krayzelburg not competing, Peirsol qualified for the 2001 World Aquatics Championships in Fukuoka, Japan, in the 100-meter backstroke, the 200-meter backstroke, and the 4×100-meter medley relay.  Peirsol's time in the 200-meter backstroke was the second-fastest ever, with only Krayzelburg's world record faster.  At the 2001 World Aquatics Championships, Peirsol won gold in the 200-meter backstroke with a time of 1:57.13, a championship record.   , Peirsol started off 2002 with the first world record of his career in the 200-meter backstroke, bettering Krayzelburg's mark set in 1999.  In his first major competition of 2002, Peirsol won five medals (three gold, one silver, one bronze) at the 2002 FINA World Swimming Championships (25 m) in Moscow. In Moscow, he was a part of the American team that broke the world record in the 4×100-meter medley relay and he broke the 200-meter backstroke world record.      At the 2002 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Yokohama, Japan, Peirsol won gold in the 100 and 200-meter backstroke and the 4×100-meter medley relay . Combined with Brendan Hansen , Michael Phelps , and Jason Lezak , Peirsol set the world record in the 4×100-meter medley relay to break the previous record set in 2000.  , At the 2003 World Aquatics Championships in Barcelona, Spain, Peirsol won gold in the 100 and 200-meter backstroke and the 4×100-meter medley relay . He also won a silver medal in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay . In his first event, the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol won gold in a time of 53.61, a championship record . His time was just 0.01 s off Lenny Krayzelburg's world record.  Peirsol participated in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay with Michael Phelps , Nate Dusing , and Klete Keller to win silver behind Australia .  Peirsol then competed in the 200-meter backstroke and won gold in a time of 1:55.92, almost two seconds ahead of second-place finisher Gordan Kožulj of Croatia .   Peirsol also competed in the 50-meter backstroke and the 4×100-meter medley relay. In the 50-meter backstroke, Peirsol finished out of medal contention with a 8th place finish.  In his last event, Peirsol competed in the 4×100-meter medley relay with Brendan Hansen , Ian Crocker , and Jason Lezak . The final time of 3:31.54 was a new world record, bettering the old mark from 2002.  , At the 2004 U.S. Olympic Team Trials, Peirsol won individual titles in the 100 and 200-meter backstroke. Four years after finishing in 4th place at the 2000 U.S. Olympic Team Trials, Peirsol won the 100-meter backstroke title, beating Lenny Krayzelburg .  Peirsol was the only individual in the field to break 54 seconds and was just off Krayzelburg's world record.  In the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol won in a world record time of 1:54.74, bettering his previous record of 1:55.15 set in 2002.  He beat his closest competitor, Michael Phelps , by more than a second.  , At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, Peirsol won gold in the 100 and 200-meter backstroke , sweeping the backstroke events, and the 4×100-meter medley relay . In his first event, the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol won gold in a time of 54.06, 0.29 s ahead of second-place finisher Markus Rogan of Austria .   In his second event, the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol won gold in an Olympic record time of 1:54.95 and completed a clean sweep of the backstroke events.  Rogan again finished second to Peirsol, 2.40 s back. An initial disqualification alleged that Peirsol had made an illegal turn during the 200-meter backstroke race. Having been improperly entered, the disqualification was eventually overturned.  In his last event, the 4×100-meter medley relay, Peirsol combined with Brendan Hansen , Ian Crocker , and Jason Lezak to win gold in a world record time of 3:30.68, 2.94 s ahead of second-place finisher Germany .  While leading off the relay, Peirsol broke the world record in the 100-meter backstroke with a time of 53.45, bettering Krayzelburg's time of 53.60 set in 1999.  , Peirsol caused minor controversy when he accused Kosuke Kitajima of Japan of using an illegal dolphin kick in the 100-meter breaststroke final when compatriot Brendan Hansen lost by 0.17 s.  , Shortly after the 2004 Summer Olympics, Peirsol competed at the 2004 FINA World Swimming Championships (25 m) in Indianapolis where he won three gold medals. His first gold medal came in the 100-meter backstroke in a time of 50.72, a new championship record.  Three days later, Peirsol competed in the 200-meter backstroke and the 4×100-meter medley relay. In the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol won gold in a world record time of 1:50.52, bettering his old mark of 1:50.64 (set earlier in 2004) and finished 2.02 s ahead of Matt Welsh of Australia .   Peirsol then competed in the 4×100-meter medley relay with Brendan Hansen , Ian Crocker , and Jason Lezak to win gold in a world record time of 3:25.09, 4.63 s ahead of Australia.  Peirsol also competed in the 50-meter backstroke but finished out of medal contention.  , At the 2005 World Championship Trials, the selection meet for the 2005 World Aquatics Championships , Peirsol won individual titles in the 100 and 200-meter backstroke. In the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol won and broke his own world record with a time of 53.17, bettering his time of 53.45 set in Athens.   In the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol easily won with a time of 1:55.13.  , At the 2005 World Aquatics Championships in Montreal, Quebec, Peirsol won gold in the 100 and 200-meter backstroke and the 4×100-meter medley relay . In his first event, the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol won gold in a time of 53.62, just 0.01 s off his championship record set two years earlier in Barcelona.  For his second event, the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol won in dominating fashion. His time of 1:54.66 was a new world record and 1.97 s ahead of second-place finisher Markus Rogan .  Peirsol then competed in the 4×100-meter medley relay with Brendan Hansen , Ian Crocker , and Jason Lezak to win gold in a time of 3:31.85, 3.23 s ahead of second-place finisher Russia .  Peirsol also competed in the 50-meter backstroke but finished out of medal contention.  , At the 2006 National Championships, the selection meet for the 2006 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships and the 2007 World Aquatics Championships , Peirsol won individual titles in the 100 and 200-meter backstroke.   At the 2006 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Victoria, British Columbia, Peirsol won gold in the 100 and 200-meter backstroke and the 4×100-meter medley relay . In his first event, the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol won gold in a championship record time of 53.32.  Peirsol was the only individual in the field to break 54 seconds and beat his closest competitor, Ryan Lochte , by 0.70 s.  Peirsol earned his second gold in the 200-meter backstroke with a world record time of 1:54.44, bettering his previous mark of 1:54.66 set last year in Montreal.  At the time, Peirsol held nine of the fastest times posted in the event and defeated second-place finisher Michael Phelps by 2.37 s.  Peirsol then competed in the 4×100-meter medley relay with Brendan Hansen , Ian Crocker , and Jason Lezak to win gold in a time of 3:31.79, a new championship record.  , At the 2007 World Aquatics Championships in Melbourne, Australia, Peirsol won one gold and one silver medal. In his first event, the 100-meter backstroke , Peirsol won gold in a world record time of 52.98, bettering his time of 53.17 set in 2005.  Peirsol became the first man in the event to go under 53 seconds and beat Ryan Lochte by 0.52 s. At the time, Peirsol held five of the fastest times posted in the event. At one point during the first 50-meters, Peirsol was a full meter behind Ryan Lochte , and at the turn, Peirsol was in third place behind Liam Tancock and Lochte. But Peirsol had a superior finish to over-take both swimmers.  After the race, Peirsol thanked Lochte for the fast start, which he attributed to the world record.  In the 200-meter backstroke , Peirsol placed second to Lochte and lost his world record he set in 2006.  Throughout the race, Peirsol was in first and at the 150-meter mark, Peirsol was ahead of Lochte 1:24.56 to 1:25.05. But Lochte had a strong finish to over-take Peirsol for the win.  For Peirsol, it was his first international loss in the event since the 2000 Summer Olympics.  Peirsol did not have a chance to swim in the 4×100-meter medley relay final because the United States was disqualified in the heats.  , At the 2008 U.S. Olympic Team Trials, Peirsol won individual titles in the 100 and 200-meter backstroke, repeating his results from the 2004 U.S. Olympic Team Trials. In his first event, the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol won ahead of Matt Grevers with a world record time of 52.89, lowering his previous mark of 52.98 set last year.   In his second event, the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol won in a time of 1:54.32, equalling Ryan Lochte 's world record set last year.  Lochte finished a close second, just 0.02 s behind Peirsol.  , At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China, Peirsol won gold in the 100-meter backstroke and the 4×100-meter medley relay . He also won silver in the 200-meter backstroke . In his first event, the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol was the heavy favorite for gold, with him being the world-record holder and the defending Olympic champion. For the final of the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol was swimming in lane two, having qualified fifth in the semifinals. At the first 50-meters in the 100-meter backstroke final, Peirsol was in second place behind Liam Tancock , who took it out in 25.11. Peirsol was 0.54 s behind Tancock at the turn. However, after the turn, Peirsol overtook Tancock, who eventually placed sixth, and won the gold. Peirsol's final time of 52.54 was a new world record, bettering his previous mark of 52.89 set last month. After the race, Peirsol said, "I'm a little bit excited, a little bit relieved, absolutely elated."  In his second event, the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol placed second to Ryan Loche 1:54.33 to 1:53.94. In winning the gold, Lochte broke the world record tie he and Peirsol shared in the 200-meter backstroke.  In his last event, the 4×100-meter medley relay, Peirsol combined with Brendan Hansen , Michael Phelps , and Jason Lezak to win gold in a world record time of 3:29.34, lowering the old mark of 3:30.68 set four years ago in Athens.  , At the 2009 National Championships, the selection meet for the 2009 World Aquatics Championships , Peirsol won individual titles in the 100- and 200-meter backstroke. In his first event, the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol won in a time of 51.94, reclaiming the world record from Aschwin Wildeboer Faber .  In winning the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol became the first person to swim the event in under 52 seconds and it was the sixth time he set the world record in the event.  In the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol defeated Ryan Lochte and reclaimed the 200-meter backstroke world record he lost in Beijing.   Peirsol also competed in the 100-meter butterfly but did not qualify for the event in Rome, finishing in third place.  , At the 2009 World Aquatics Championships in Rome, Peirsol won two gold medals. In his first event, the 100-meter backstroke , Peirsol surprised many after he failed to make the final, which he attributed to a miscalculation of his own position in the semifinals. Peirsol said, "I thought I was going faster. I am very disappointed. I completely misjudged my race. I have to go on, pick myself up and focus on my next events."  But Peirsol's world record in the 100-meter backstroke would stay in place after the final.  In his second event, the 200-meter backstroke , Peirsol won the gold in a time of 1:51.92, breaking his own world record of 1:53.08 by more than a second.  Peirsol then competed in the 50-meter backstroke but did not advance past the heats.  In his last event, the 4×100-meter medley relay , Peirsol combined with Eric Shanteau , Michael Phelps , and David Walters to win gold in a world record time of 3:27.28, lowering the old mark of 3:29.34 set a year ago in Beijing.  While leading off the relay, Peirsol broke the championship record in the 100-meter backstroke with a time of 52.19, bettering the previous mark of 52.26 set by Junya Koga .  , At the 2010 National Championships , Peirsol placed second in both the 100- and 200-meter backstroke.   In the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol placed second to David Plummer , who touched just 0.03 s ahead. For Peirsol, it was his first loss in the 100-meter backstroke at a national championships since he placed 4th at the 2000 U.S. Olympic Team Trials.   In the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol placed second to Ryan Lochte , who finished 0.70 s ahead.  , At the 2010 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Irvine, California, Peirsol won gold in the 100-meter backstroke and the 4×100-meter medley relay . Peirsol's first gold came in the 100-meter backstroke. Initially, Peirsol did not qualify to swim in the medal-awarding final because only a maximum of two swimmers from one country could enter in the finals and David Plummer and Ryan Lochte owned the top two American spots.  However, Lochte withdrew from the 100-meter backstroke and as a result, Peirsol advanced to the finals. Peirsol won the gold in a time of 53.31, breaking his own championship record set in 2006.  Peirsol then competed in the 200-meter backstroke but did not qualify to swim in the medal-awarding final, with Lochte and Tyler Clary taking the top two American spots.  In his final event, the 4×100-meter medley relay, Peirsol won gold along with compatriots Mark Gangloff , Michael Phelps , and Nathan Adrian . This would be the last race of his international career. When the competition was over, Peirsol said he put his swimming equipment in a locker and walked away.   , On February 2, 2011, at the age of twenty-seven, Peirsol announced that he was officially retiring from professional swimming.  This ended months of speculation after Peirsol withdrew from his spots in both the 2010 FINA World Swimming Championships (25 m) in Dubai and the 2011 World Aquatics Championships in Shanghai. Peirsol said he contemplated retirement after the 2008 Summer Olympics . In 2010, he said he had no further goals and found it difficult to swim because he "ended up doing everything (he) set out to do." He added, "Things outside of the sport started to interest me." Peirsol said it was "poetic" that he ended his career at the same pool he trained in as a kid at the 2010 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships .  Peirsol plans to go to graduate school at the University of Texas at Austin to study political science .  ,  Thomas Michael Jager (born October 6, 1964) is an American former competition swimmer . He is five-time Olympic gold medalist in relay events, a two-time World Championship individual gold medalist for the 50-meter freestyle, and a former world record-holder in two events. Jager set the 50-meter freestyle world record on six occasions during his career. He held this record for over ten years from August 1989 to June 2000. , , , Jager attended the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and swam for coach Ron Ballatore 's UCLA Bruins swimming and diving team in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) competition from 1983 to 1985. He won NCAA individual national championships in the 100-yard freestyle (1983, 1984), the 50-yard freestyle (1984, 1985), and the 100-yard backstroke (1985). In 1984, he was honored as the Pacific-10 Conference Swimmer of the Year. , He was also an eleven-time United States national open champion. , Jager won seven Olympic medals for the United States. He won five gold medals in relay events. He also won an individual silver medal in the 50-meter freestyle in 1988 , and an individual bronze medal in the 50-meter freestyle in 1992 .  , At the World Championships , Jager won gold medals in the 50-meter freestyle in 1986 and 1991. He also won gold medals in the 50-meter freestyle at the Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in 1989 and 1991. , Jager was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 2001.  , In 2004, Jager became the head coach of the University of Idaho 's Idaho Vandals women's swim team.  Jager then accepted the head coaching position for the Washington State Cougars swim team at Washington State University in 2011. , Tom is the youngest of a family of swimming siblings. While under a swimming scholarship at the University of Iowa , his eldest sister Diane was an All-American swimmer. His brother Bill qualified for Nationals while in high school and then went on to earn a full swimming scholarship at the University of Illinois . All three siblings went on to work as swimming coaches. , Tom has two sons, Wyatt (born 1996) and Cy (born 1999), both of whom swim for his swimming club, the Gold Medal Swim Club. , ,  Donald Arthur Schollander (born April 30, 1946) is an American former competition swimmer , five-time Olympic champion, and former world record-holder in four events. He won a total of five gold medals and one silver medal at the 1964 and 1968 Summer Olympics . With four gold medals, he was the most successful athlete at the 1964 Olympics.  , , , Schollander was born in Charlotte, North Carolina ,  and learned competitive swimming from his uncle, Newt Perry , who ran a swimming school in Florida.  As a boy, Schollander moved with his family to Lake Oswego, Oregon .  Although his first sporting passion was football , he was too small to compete in high school football.  Instead, he joined Lake Oswego High School 's swim team, and in 1960, helped lead the team to an Oregon state swimming championship as a freshman.   , As a teenager in 1962, Schollander moved to Santa Clara, California to train under swim coach George Haines of the Santa Clara Swim Club .  Two years later at the age of 18, he won three freestyle events at the AAU national championships.  He made the U.S. Olympic team in two individual events and two relays. Months later, he won four gold medals and set three world records at the 1964 Summer Olympics , at the time the most medals won by an American since Jesse Owens in 1936.  His success helped earn him the James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in the United States, and the AP Athlete of the Year, defeating runner-up Johnny Unitas by a wide margin.  He was also named ABC 's Wide World of Sports Athlete of the Year. , Schollander appeared on an episode of To Tell the Truth immediately after winning his four gold medals. , Schollander attended Yale University and is a member of the Skull and Bones secret society and the Delta Kappa Epsilon (Phi chapter) fraternity, as was the future President George W. Bush .  He was the captain of Yale's swim team , winning three individual NCAA championships.  At the 1968 Summer Olympics , Schollander won another gold medal in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay , but finishing second in the 200-meter freestyle , the event that Schollander had considered to be his best.  This was the first Olympics in which 200-meter swimming events were part of the competition. , Following the 1968 Olympics, Schollander retired from competitive swimming. , Schollander was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1965, at the age of 19.  In 1983, he was one of the first group of inductees into the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame. He is also a member of Oregon Sports Hall of Fame .  , In 1971, he published his first book, Deep Water (with Duke Savage) chronicling his swimming, his teammates and coaches, and the behind-the-scenes politics of international swimming, especially the Olympic Games. He followed this book in 1974 with Inside Swimming (with Joel H. Cohen). , Schollander resides with his wife Cheryl in Lake Oswego, Oregon , where he runs Schollander Development, a real estate development company. His gold medals are on display to the public at a Bank of America branch location in downtown Lake Oswego.  Schollander has three children, Jeb, Kyle and Katie.  , ,  Johnny Weissmuller (born Peter Johann Weißmüller ;  June 2, 1904 – January 20, 1984) was an American competition swimmer and actor best known for playing Tarzan in films of the 1930s and 1940s and for having one of the best competitive swimming records of the 20th century. Weissmuller was one of the world's fastest swimmers in the 1920s, winning five Olympic gold medals for swimming and one bronze medal for water polo. He won fifty-two U.S. National Championships, set more than fifty world records, both in freestyle and backstroke,  and was purportedly undefeated in official competition for the entirety of his competitive career. After retiring from competitions, he became the sixth actor to portray Edgar Rice Burroughs 's ape man, Tarzan, a role he played in twelve motion pictures. Dozens of other actors have also played Tarzan, but Weissmuller is by far the best known. His character's distinctive Tarzan yell is still often used in films. , , , Weissmüller was an ethnic German, one of two boys born to Peter Weissmüller and his wife Elisabeth Kersch, who were both Banat Swabians , an ethnic German population in Southeast Europe. His generally accepted birthplace was in the Freidorf ( Szabadfalu ) suburb of the current city of Timișoara , Romania (German: Temeschburg, Hungarian: Temesvár) The village is in Romania . However, the ship's roster from his family's arrival at Ellis Island lists his birthplace as Párdány , Kingdom of Hungary , in what is today a village in Serbia , not far from the Romanian border.     , According to his son Johnny Jr., Johnny (senior) was named Peter by his parents; but, once he began to be successful as a swimmer, he formally used his brother's name, Johnny, because his brother John was, by birth, a U.S. citizen (and had official records that verified this fact), and Peter was not (this was done so that non-citizen Peter could represent the United States in the Olympics).  , The records of St Rochus Church in Freidorf show that Johann, son of Peter Weissmüller and Elizabeth Kersch, was baptized there on May 6, 1904. The passenger manifest of the S.S. Rotterdam , which arrived in New York on January 26, 1905, lists Peter Weissmüller, a 29-year-old laborer, his 24-year-old wife Elisabeth, and seven-month-old Johann. The family is listed as Germans, last residence (Timișoara). They intended to join their brother-in-law Johann Ott of Windber, Pennsylvania . On November 5, 1905, Johann Peter Weissmüller was baptized at St John Cantius Catholic Church in Windber.  In the 1910 census, Peter and Elizabeth Weisenmüller as well as John and Eva Ott were living at 1521 Cleveland Ave in the 22nd Ward of Chicago, with sons John, age six, born in Temesvár and Peter Jr., age five, erroneously entered as born in Illinois . Peter Weissmüller and John Ott were both brewers, Ott emigrating in 1902, Weissmüller in 1904. The ethnic group known as Banat Swabians had lived for several centuries in that region and developed a distinctive dialect and cultural traits. , When Weissmüller was a small child, the family emigrated to the United States aboard the S.S. Rotterdam as steerage passengers. They left Rotterdam on January 14, 1905, and arrived at Ellis Island in New York harbor twelve days later as Peter, Elisabeth and Johann Weissmüller. The passenger list records them as ethnic Germans and citizens of Austria-Hungary . After a brief stay in Chicago visiting relatives, they moved to the coal mining town of Windber, Pennsylvania . (For most of Weissmüller's career, show business biographies incorrectly listed him as having been born in Pennsylvania. Some sources [ who? ] state that Weissmüller lied about his birthplace to ensure his place on the US Olympic swimming team.) Peter Weissmuller worked as a miner, and his youngest son, Peter Weissmüller, Jr., was born in Windber on 3 September 1905. Peter Jr. is listed on one census as having been born in Illinois. , At age nine, Weissmüller contracted polio . At the suggestion of his doctor, he took up swimming to help battle the disease. After the family moved from Western Pennsylvania to Chicago , Weissmüller continued swimming and eventually earned a spot on the YMCA swim team.   According to military draft registration records for World War I, Peter and Elizabeth were apparently still together as late as 1917. On his paperwork, Peter was listed as a brewer, working for the Elston and Fullerton Brewery. He and his family were living at 226 West North Avenue in Chicago . In his book, Tarzan, My Father , Johnny Weissmuller Jr. stated that although rumors of Peter Weissmüller living to "a ripe old age, remarrying along the way and spawning a large brood of little Weissmüllers" were reported, no one in the family was aware of his ultimate fate.  Peter signed his consent for 19-year old John "Weissmuller"'s passport application in 1924, preceding Johnny's Olympic competition in France. In the 1930 federal census, Elizabeth Weissmüller, age 49, has listed with her, sons John P. and Peter J., and Peter's wife Dorothy. Elizabeth is listed as a widow. , As a teen, Weissmuller attended Lane Technical College Prep High School before dropping out to work various jobs including a stint as a lifeguard at a Lake Michigan beach. While working as an elevator operator and bellboy at the Illinois Athletic Club, Weissmuller caught the eye of swim coach William Bachrach . Bachrach trained Weissmuller and in August 1921, Weissmuller won the national championships in the 50-yard and 220-yard distances. Though he was foreign-born, Weissmuller gave his birthplace as Tanneryville, Pennsylvania, and his birth date as that of his younger brother, Peter Weissmuller. This was to ensure his eligibility to compete as part of the United States Olympic team, and was a critical issue in being issued an United States passport .  (This comment seems to be contradicted by data on his actual passport application; on his 1924 passport application, he listed his date of birth as June 2, 1904, and his place of birth as Windbar, Pennsylvania. His father, Peter, signed an affidavit to this effect, giving his 19-year-old son permission to travel abroad to participate in the Paris Olympics and for other competitions in England and Belgium. His passport was issued in May, 1924.) , On July 9, 1922, Weissmuller broke Duke Kahanamoku 's world record in the 100-meter freestyle, swimming it in 58.6 seconds.  He won the title for that distance at the 1924 Summer Olympics , beating Kahanamoku for the gold.  He also won the 400-meter freestyle and was a member of the winning U.S. team in the 4×200-meter relay. As a member of the U.S. water polo team, he also won a bronze medal. Four years later, at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam , he won another two gold medals.   It was during this period that Weissmuller became an enthusiast for John Harvey Kellogg 's holistic lifestyle views on nutrition, enemas and exercise. He came to Kellogg's Battle Creek, Michigan sanatorium to dedicate its new 120-foot swimming pool, and would go on to break one of his own previous swimming records after adopting the vegetarian diet prescribed by Kellogg.  , In 1927, Weissmuller set a new world record of 51.0 seconds in the 100-yard freestyle, which stood for 17 years. He improved it to 48.5 s at Billy Rose World's Fair Aquacade in 1940, aged 36, but this result was discounted as he was competing as a professional.   , In all, Weissmuller won five Olympic gold medals and one bronze medal, fifty-two United States national championships,  and set sixty-seven world records . He was the first man to swim the 100-meter freestyle under one minute and the 440-yard freestyle under five minutes. He never lost a race and retired with an unbeaten amateur record.    In 1950, he was selected by the Associated Press as the greatest swimmer of the first half of the 20th Century.  , Weissmuller would later, upon moving to the prosperous Bel Air section of Los Angeles, California, (specifically to an area known today as East Gate Bel Air ), famously commission architect Paul Williams to design a large home with a 300-foot serpentine swimming pool that curled around the house (and which still exists to this day).  , In 1929, Weissmuller signed a contract with BVD to be a model and representative. He traveled throughout the country doing swim shows, handing out leaflets promoting that brand of swimwear , signing autographs and going on radio. In that same year, he made his first motion picture appearance as an Adonis , wearing only a fig leaf, in a movie entitled Glorifying the American Girl . He appeared as himself in the first of several Crystal Champions movie shorts featuring Weissmuller and other Olympic champions at Silver Springs, Florida . , He co-starred with Esther Williams in Billy Rose's Aquacade during the New York World's Fair 1939–41, pursuing her throughout a span of two years.  , His acting career began when he signed a seven-year contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and played the role of Tarzan in Tarzan the Ape Man (1932). The movie was a huge success and Weissmuller became an overnight international sensation. The author of Tarzan , Edgar Rice Burroughs , was pleased with Weissmuller, although he so hated the studio's depiction of a Tarzan who barely spoke English that he created his own concurrent Tarzan series filmed on location in Central American jungles and starring Herman Brix as a suitably articulate version of the character. , Weissmuller starred in six Tarzan movies for MGM with actress Maureen O'Sullivan as Jane and Cheeta the Chimpanzee. The last three also included Johnny Sheffield as Boy. Then, in 1942, Weissmuller went to RKO and starred in six more Tarzan movies with markedly reduced production values. Unlike MGM, RKO allowed Weissmuller to play other roles, though a three picture contract with Pine-Thomas Productions led to only one film, Swamp Fire , being made, co-starring Buster Crabbe . Sheffield appeared as Boy in the first five features for RKO. Another co-star was Brenda Joyce , who played Jane in Weissmuller's last four Tarzan movies. In a total of twelve Tarzan films, Weissmuller earned an estimated $2,000,000 and established himself as what many movie historians consider the definitive Tarzan. Although not the first Tarzan in movies (that honor went to Elmo Lincoln ), he was the first to be associated with the now traditional ululating, yodeling Tarzan yell. (During an appearance on television's The Mike Douglas Show in the 1970s, Weissmuller explained how the famous yell was created. Recordings of three vocalists were spliced together to get the effect—a soprano , an alto , and a hog caller.) , When Weissmuller finally left that role, he immediately traded his loincloth costume for a slouch hat and safari suit for the role of Jungle Jim (1948) for Columbia . He made thirteen Jungle Jim films between 1948 and 1954. According to actor Michael Fox , Weissmuller would shoot two Jungle Jim films back to back with nine days filming for each with a break of two days between, then he would return to his home in Mexico.  Within the next year due to the rights of the name "Jungle Jim" being taken by Screen Gems, he appeared in three more jungle movies, playing himself. In 1955, he began production of the Jungle Jim television adventure series for Screen Gems , a film subsidiary of Columbia . His costars were Martin Huston and Dean Fredericks . The show produced only twenty-six episodes, which were subsequently played repeatedly on network and syndicated television. Aside from a first screen appearance as Adonis and the role of Johnny Duval in the 1946 film Swamp Fire , Weissmuller played only three roles in films during the heyday of his Hollywood career: Tarzan, Jungle Jim, and himself. , According to David Wallechinsky's Complete Book of the Olympics , while playing in a celebrity golf tournament in Cuba in 1958, Weissmuller's golf cart was suddenly captured by rebel soldiers . Weissmuller sized up the situation, got out of the cart and gave his trademark Tarzan yell. The shocked rebels soon began to jump up and down, calling "Tarzan! Welcome to Cuba!" Johnny and his companions were not only not kidnapped, but were given a rebel escort to the golf course. [ citation needed ] However, Weissmuller didn't do the yell himself for the movies so the anecdote is dubious. , He was an accomplished amateur golfer and played in two official PGA Tour tournaments, at the 1937 Western Open at Canterbury Golf Club outside Cleveland (87-85=172, missed the cut) and the 1948 Hawaiian Open (79-75-79-76=309) to finish in 37th place. , In the late 1950s, Weissmuller moved back to Chicago and started a swimming pool company. He lent his name to other business ventures, but did not have a great deal of success. He retired in 1965 and moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida , where he was Founding Chairman of the International Swimming Hall of Fame (ISHOF). He was inducted into the ISHOF the same year.  , In September 1966, Weissmuller joined former screen Tarzans James Pierce and Jock Mahoney to appear with Ron Ely as part of the publicity for the upcoming premiere of the Tarzan TV series. The producers also approached Weissmuller to guest star as Tarzan's father, but nothing came of it. [ citation needed ] In the late 60s, early 70s, Weissmuller was involved with a doomed tourist attraction called Tropical/Florida Wonderland , a.k.a. Tarzan's Jungleland, on US 1 in Titusville, Florida . It was a last-ditch effort to transform Florida Wonderland into something much bigger. It failed when Weissmuller and the owners did not see eye to eye, it was shut down for good in 1973. , His face appeared in the collage on the iconic front cover of The Beatles ' 1967 record album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band . , Based on his interest in natural lifestyles, Weissmuller opened a small chain of health food stores called Johnny Weissmuller's American Natural Foods in California in 1969.   , In 1970, he attended the British Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh , where he was presented to Queen Elizabeth II . That same year, he made an appearance with former co-star Maureen O'Sullivan in The Phynx (1970). , Weissmuller lived in Florida until the end of 1973, then moved to Las Vegas , Nevada , where he worked as a greeter at Caesars Palace along with boxer Joe Louis for a time. In 1976, he appeared for the last time in a motion picture, playing a movie crewman who is fired by a movie mogul, played by Art Carney , in Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood , and he also made his final public appearance in that year when he was inducted into the Body Building Guild Hall of Fame. , Weissmuller had five wives: band and club singer Bobbe Arnst (married 1931 – divorced 1933); actress Lupe Vélez (married 1933 – divorced 1939); Beryl Scott (married 1939 – divorced 1948); Allene Gates (married 1948 – divorced 1962); and Maria Baumann (married 1963 – his death 1984). , With his third wife, Beryl, he had three children, Johnny Weissmuller, Jr. (September 23, 1940 – July 27, 2006), Wendy Anne Weissmuller (b. June 1, 1942), and Heidi Elizabeth Weissmuller (July 31, 1944 – November 19, 1962). , In 1974, Weissmuller broke both his hip and leg, marking the beginning of years of declining health. While hospitalized he learned that, in spite of his strength and lifelong daily regimen of swimming and exercise, he had a serious heart condition. In 1977, Weissmuller suffered a series of strokes . In 1979, he entered the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, California for several weeks before moving with his last wife, Maria, to Acapulco, Mexico , the location of his last Tarzan movie.  , On January 20, 1984, Weissmuller died from pulmonary edema at the age of 79.  He was buried just outside Acapulco, Valle de La Luz at the Valley of the Light Cemetery. As his coffin was lowered into the ground, a recording of the Tarzan yell he invented was played three times, at his request.  , His former co-star and movie son, Johnny Sheffield , wrote of him, "I can only say that working with Big John was one of the highlights of my life. He was a Star (with a capital "S") and he gave off a special light and some of that light got into me. Knowing and being with Johnny Weissmuller during my formative years had a lasting influence on my life."  , For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Johnny Weissmuller has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6541 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood , facing the star of Maureen O'Sullivan . , In 1973, Weissmuller was awarded the George Eastman Award,  given by George Eastman House for distinguished contribution to the art of film.  Aleksandr Vladimirovich Popov (also Alexander Popov, Russian : Александр Владимирович Попов ); (born 16 November 1971) is a Russian former Olympic gold-winning swimmer regarded as one of the greatest sprint freestyle swimmers of all time, and the only swimmer in history, male or female, to win four individual Olympic gold medals in freestyle events. , , , Popov began swimming at age 8 at the Children and Youth Sports School of Fakel Sports Complex in Lesnoy,   at that time afraid of water. However, his father insisted on him taking swimming lessons in that sports school, and in his own words, he has "been stuck there ever since". Popov started out as a backstroker but switched to freestyle when he joined Gennadi Touretski 's squad in 1990 on the initiative by the Head Coach of the USSR National Team Glep Petrov.  He later moved from Russia to Australia to be with his coach. , Popov won the men's 50 m and 100 m freestyle in the Barcelona Olympics in 1992, and repeated his victories in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics , becoming the first man to do so since Johnny Weissmuller . He presented Touretski with his 1996 Olympic gold medal from the 100 m freestyle. "I have a title and I'm on the paper, but, you know, Gennadi hasn't gotten anything from Atlanta or from Barcelona," Popov said. "But I know how much this particular medal means for him, is worth for him." , One month after the Atlanta Olympics, he was stabbed in the abdomen with a knife during a dispute with three Moscow street vendors. The knife sliced his artery, grazed one of his kidneys and damaged the pleura, the membrane that encases the lungs. He had emergency surgery and spent three months in rehabilitation. At the 1997 European Championships in Seville , Spain , he successfully defended his 50 m and 100 m freestyle titles. , In the 2003 Barcelona World Championships , Popov once again made a clean sweep of the men's 50 m and 100 m freestyle events, citing that Barcelona would always be special to him, for it was there that for him, everything first began. He announced his participation in the 2004 Athens Olympics . However, being the oldest competitor at the pool, the gold medal eluded him, and he did not even manage to make it into the finals of both the men's 50 m and 100 m freestyle events. He announced his retirement from the sport in January 2005.  , Popov was elected a full member of the International Olympic Committee in December 1999. He also represents the athletes on the IOC Sport for All Commission and was elected directly as one of seven athletes to the IOC Athletes' Commission by the athletes participating in the 1996 Olympics. He was re-elected to the Athletes Commission at the 2000 Games and is now Honorary Secretary. He was awarded the 1996 Russian Medal of Honour for contributions to sport. He was also named Russian Athlete of the Year and European Sports Press Union Athlete of the Year in 1996. , In June 2003, he confirmed that he was permanently leaving Australia in early 2004 to live in Solothurn , Switzerland . He said the move followed the offer of a business proposition in Switzerland, once he had retired from swimming. He retained Touretski as a long-distance coach. , Popov has both a Bachelor's and Master's Degrees in Sports Coaching from the Russian Academy. He is a spokesman for Omega SA . , He has recently appeared at the closing ceremony of the Beijing Olympics after being elected a member of the IOC, presenting flowers to volunteers.

After graduating he worked as orthopedic surgeon. He retired from swimming in 1976, and in May 1978 married Kornelia Ender , a fellow East German Olympic swimmer. They divorced in 1982.    , The issue of doping in East Germany brought into questioning most achievements of East German athletes. However, Matthes denied any involvement in doping, clarifying that his swimming club was too small to be part of the government system.   Jason Edward Lezak (born November 12, 1975) is an American competition swimmer who is a four-time Olympic gold medalist. He formerly swam for Irvine Novaquatics . He graduated from Irvine High School in 1994, and then from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1999. , Lezak is a specialist in the 50-meter and 100-meter freestyle races. He also owns long-course world records in the 400m freestyle and medley relays, and is a former American record holder in the 100-meter freestyle. Lezak is one of the few elite swimmers not to have a personal coach. Despite this, Lezak enjoys team sports and fellow American Gary Hall, Jr. dubbed Lezak as a "professional relay swimmer" at the 2004 U.S. Olympic Trials before their match-up in the 100-meter freestyle.   , , , Lezak was born in Irvine, California , the son of Linda (née Mann), an elementary school science teacher, and David Lezak, a former leather goods salesman.

In the final 25 meters, Lezak overtook French team anchor Alain Bernard (the world record holder in the 100-meter freestyle going into the relay) to win gold despite Bernard having nearly a full body length's advantage when Lezak started his leg and half a body length with 25 meters from the end. Lezak split a 46.06, the fastest 100-meter freestyle split in history, by nearly six tenths of a second. The final time of the American team was 3:08:24, which was 3.99 seconds faster than the previous world record; the French team finished second at 3:08.32, eight one-hundredths (0.08) of a second behind—the closest finish in the event's history. This was a crucial race for Michael Phelps , because he needed it to complete the goal of winning eight gold medals in a single Olympic Games, breaking Mark Spitz 's record of seven gold medals at the 1972 Summer Olympics .  , Lezak also earned his first individual Olympic medal, having tied for the bronze with Brazillian swimmer César Cielo Filho in the 100-meter freestyle with a time of 47.67. , Lezak qualified for his fourth Olympics at the 2012 United States Olympic Trials in Omaha, Nebraska.

He won gold medals for the men's 100 m and 200 m breaststroke at both the Athens 2004 , and the Beijing 2008  Summer Olympic games. , , , Kitajima is a decorated swimmer in the world championships and was the world record holder in the 100 m breaststroke that he set at the 2008 Beijing Olympics – this mark has since been bettered by first Brenton Rickard and later Cameron van der Burgh . He was also bronze medal winner in the same Olympics in the 4×100 m medley relay. He edged out his main rival Brendan Hansen who finished fourth while Kitajima won the gold medal and set the new world record. , He received four gold medals, one silver and two bronze medals in total at the 2004, 2008 and 2012 Olympics.  , His most significant rival in the breaststroke was the American swimmer Brendan Hansen . They dueled at events such as the 2005 World Championships , 2004 Summer Olympics and 2003 World Championships . Kitajima set both world records for 100 m and 200 m breaststroke in the latter occasion. Later his best in 200 m was overcome by Dimitri Komornikov and then by Hansen, who also broke Kitajima's record in the 100 m. Kitajima regained the world record (58.91) in the 100 m at the 2008 Summer Olympics . Kitajima regained the 200 m breaststroke world record in June 2008 at the Japan Open. His time of 2:07.51 shaved nearly a second off the previous record of 2:08.50 set by Hansen in 2006.  , During the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Kitajima generated buzz for his primal screams of exuberance after edging out Hansen in the 100 m and 200 m breaststroke for the gold. At a pool side interview (3'24") following his victory in the 100 m, Kosuke Kitajima also popularised the phrase 'cho-kimochi-ii,' meaning "I feel really good." The word went on to win the 2004 U-Can Neologisms and Vogue Words contest.  , In long course swimming pools Kitajima's bests are:  Jennifer Elisabeth Thompson (born February 26, 1973), later known by her married name Jenny Cumpelik , is an American former competition swimmer , and one of the most decorated Olympians in history, winning twelve medals, including eight gold medals, in the 1992 , 1996 , 2000 , and 2004 Summer Olympics . , Thompson, a Massachusetts native who calls Dover, New Hampshire her hometown, began swimming at age 7 at a summer country club called Cedardale in Groveland, Massachusetts .

However, she failed to qualify for the final in the 200-meter freestyle, finished a disappointing fifth in the 50-meter, and finished second in the 100-meter, where she was beaten by Zhuang Yong of China. Thompson won two gold medals as part of the 4×100-meter freestyle and 4×100-meter medley teams. Considerable controversy was raised after the 100-meter freestyle when the U.S. team speculated on the loose doping policy standards in Barcelona—at that time the event winner did not have a mandatory doping test—only the second and fourth-place finishers were tested, based on a random draw. Thompson and her teammates believed that the Olympic champion should be tested and that rule was changed a few months later when nine members of the Chinese swimming team tested positive for steroid use. , Thompson continued her career as a member of the U.S. national team and a member of the Stanford University swimming team, and continued to rank among the world's best swimmers for the next four years.

At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney , Australia she won a bronze in the 100-meter freestyle and was fifth in the 100-meter butterfly. But in the relay events, she swam the anchor leg in helping the USA defend its titles in the 4×100-meter freestyle and the 4×200-meter freestyle relays. She also swam the butterfly leg in the winning 4×100-meter relays. The 4×100-meter freestyle and medley teams set new world records in the process. , At the World Championships that year, she broke the world record in the 100-meter butterfly for the fourth time, winning a qualifying heat in a time of 56.56 en route to a gold medal in the event. , Thompson seemingly retired from competition after the 2000 season with 10 Olympic medals, eight gold, one silver and one bronze, and 12 gold medals at World Championships. In 2001, Thompson moved to New York City to begin studying at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons . However, while attending medical school, she made a return to competition at the 2002 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Yokohama , Japan . Thompson won five medals in two days, setting a career-best time in winning the 50-meter freestyle.

During her Olympic career, Thompson won twelve medals, eight of which were relay gold; the most for any female Olympic swimmer in history. , In 2006, Thompson received a medical degree from the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons . She did her internship at the New York City Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center , and residency anesthesiologist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston .  In June, 2010 she was assaulted when two men attempted to steal her scooter, however she was able to fight off both of her attackers.   , Thompson married Daniel Richard Cumpelik on September 5, 2010.  She currently works as an anesthesiologist for the Spectrum medical group at Maine Medical Center in Portland, Maine. , Thompson has volunteered as a celebrity swimmer for Swim Across America , a charitable organization that raises money for cancer research, since 1995. , She was the 1993 and 1998 USA Swimming Swimmer of the Year, and ranked as the 62nd greatest female athlete of all time in a 1999 poll conducted by Sports Illustrated .

She was expected to win gold medals at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic games, but was unable to compete due to the boycott by 14 Eastern Bloc countries, including East Germany. In 1985 she fractured a vertebra, keeping her from competing for most of the year or to go to the European Championships. , Otto returned to competitive swimming at the 1986 World Championships in Madrid, where she won 4 gold medals (100 m freestyle, 200 m individual medley, 4×100 m medley relay and 4×100 m freestyle relay) and 2 silver medals (50 m freestyle, 100 m butterfly).

She was featured in a milk ad with a photograph taken by world-renowned photographer Annie Leibovitz , and she was honored with her own Wheaties box. , She continued to compete after the 1996 Olympics, but was plagued by injury, including a shoulder injury which required several operations and which left her unable to train for over a year. She staged a comeback, however, and made the 2000 U.S. Olympic Team in the 50-meter freestyle, the 4×100 medley relay and the 4×100 freestyle relay. At the Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia, Van Dyken won two gold medals in these latter two events, and placed 4th in the 50-meter freestyle. This brought her total career Olympic medal count to six gold medals. In addition to her Olympic accomplishments, Van Dyken won several world titles and set numerous American and world records. , Van Dyken has the distinction of being one of the few Olympians whose medals are all gold. , Van Dyken lost public support when she spit in the lane of rival Inge de Bruijn at the 2000 Summer Olympics . After losing to de Bruijn, Van Dyken responded by saying she, too, could have won a gold medal "if I were a man."  , In 2003, Van Dyken was called to testify before a grand jury regarding the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative (BALCO) steroid scandal.  While Van Dyken was a regular client at BALCO,  she has never tested positive for performance enhancing drugs. , Van Dyken retired from swimming after the 2000 Olympics and married former NFL punter Tom Rouen not long after. They split their time between Colorado and Arizona. , Since her retirement, Van Dyken has toured on a number of speaking engagements to groups as varied as schools and multi-national corporations, she has been a disc jockey on a sports radio show in Arizona, served as the side-line reporter for the Seattle Seahawks and Denver Broncos football teams, and even played in the award-winning stage-play the Vagina Monologues . She is actively involved in a number of charities, including the Make-A-Wish Foundation , and along with husband Rouen runs an annual celebrity fundraiser in Evergreen, Colorado, to raise money for disadvantaged youth. She was the head coach of the varsity swim team at Notre Dame Preparatory High School in Scottsdale, Arizona. On May 12, she was the only American swimmer to be inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame 's Class of 2007. She was inducted to the Olympic Hall of Fame in July 2008. She was a morning drive-time host on 98.7 The Peak FM in Phoenix, Arizona, as a part of "Chris and Amy in the Morning" from 2010 to 2011. She resigned from 98.7 The Peak FM on July 12, 2011, to 'attend to some family issues that are going to take her back to Denver.'  She was the co-host of Fox Sports Radio's Fox Sports Tonight with Rob Dibble  until December 2013.  , On June 6, 2014, Van Dyken was in a severe ATV accident and severed her spinal cord at the T11 vertebra . She was conscious when rescued and airlifted to a hospital where she had emergency surgery to stabilize her spinal cord and vertebral column. Following the initial surgical measures, she was in satisfactory condition. The injury to the area came within millimeters of impacting and potentially rupturing her aorta . However, the accident did leave her paralyzed from the waist down.  After two months of rehabilitation, Van Dyken left Craig Hospital in Englewood, Colorado, saying, "I’m a better person than before the injury,"  and took her first steps.  , ,  Krisztina Egerszegi ( Hungarian pronunciation:  [ˈkristinɒ ˈɛɡɛrsɛɡi] ; born 16 August 1974 in Budapest, Hungary ) is a Hungarian former world record holding swimmer and one of the greatest Hungarian Olympic champions of the modern era. She is a three-time Olympian ( 1988 , 1992 and 1996 ) and five time Olympic champion; and one of three individuals ( Dawn Fraser and Michael Phelps being other two) to have ever won the same swimming event at three Summer Olympics. She is the most successful and greatest female swimmer of all-time with 5 individual Olympic gold medals and she is the first and only female swimmer who won 5 individual Olympic gold medals.    , She held the world record in the long course 200 m backstroke for almost 17 years (August 1991 – February 2008), after setting it at the 1991 European Championships (2:06.62). As of June 2009, that time remains the European and Hungarian records . It is the oldest record on the European list, and the second-oldest on the Hungarian list — Egerszegi's former world record in the 100 m backstroke (1:00.31), set 3 days prior to the 200 m backstroke, is the oldest. She is considered by many to be the greatest female backstroker of all-time. , , , She made her international debut at the 1987 European Aquatics Championships at the age of 13, coming fourth in the 200 m backstroke and fifth in the 100 m backstroke. , At the 1988 Summer Olympics she won silver medal in the 100 m backstroke and became Olympic champion in the 200 m backstroke. At the age of 14 years and 41 days she became the youngest-ever female Olympic champion in swimming. This youth record was broken in 1992 by Kyoko Iwasaki of Japan, who won a gold medal in the 200 meter breaststroke at the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games at the age of 14 years and six days. , At the 1989 European Aquatics Championships she competed in three events adding the 400 m medley to the 100 m and 200 m backstroke, winning silver medal in all three events despite she struggled with a strong cold during the entire Championships. , In 1991 she competed at the World Championships winning the gold medal in both backstroke events. Few months later at the European Championships she won three gold medals and set World records in the 100 m and 200 m backstroke event. , At the 1992 Summer Olympics she won three individual gold medals, becoming the only female athlete at the Games to do so. The next year at the European Championships she competed in the 200 m butterfly for the first time and went on to win four gold medals also winning the 400 m medley and the 100 m and 200 m backstroke. , In 1994, she announced that she would retire after the World Championships in Rome which was overshadowed by the suspicious Chinese swimmers' performances. China won 12 of the 16 women's titles, however these achievements were sullied less than a month later when seven Chinese swimmers tested positive for banned drugs at the Asian Games in Hiroshima.    In Rome, Egerszegi lost on 100 m and 200 m backstroke, the events were won by He Cihong ,who was only 13th (1:03.50!) on 100 m backstroke 2 years earlier in Barcelona, where Egerszegi won with an Olympic record time (1:00.68). In 1996, at the Olympic Games in Atlanta, He Cihong was 25th on the 100 m backstroke. On the 200 m backstroke,He Cihong qualified for nor Barcelona, neither Atlanta; both Olympic golds won by Egerszegi. After getting fifth place in the 100 m backstroke and coming second in the 200 m backstroke, Egerszegi decided to compete for two more years, citing the two defeats as the main reason. , She competed at the 1995 European Aquatics Championships where she won the last two of her nine European titles in the 400 m medley and the 200 m backstroke event. For the first time, she competed in the 4x100 m medley relay where one of her teammates was a young Ágnes Kovács , a future Olympic champion. They came second and Egerszegi has named this silver medal as 'the one that made her the happiest'. She decided not to compete in the 100 m backstroke even though her time of 1:00.93 clocked during the 4x100 m relay final was better than Mette Jacobsen 's winning time of 1:02.46 by almost two seconds. , At the 1996 Summer Olympics she won her first and only Olympic bronze medal in the 400 m medley and went on to win the 200 m backstroke becoming the second of only three swimmers in Olympic history (Dawn Fraser and Michael Phelps being the other two) to win gold for the same event at three successive Olympics (200 m backstroke: 1988, 1992, 1996). Between the winning time of Egerszegi(2:07.83) and time of the runner-up Whitney Hedgepeth (2:11.98), the margin of victory was 4.15 seconds, which is the greatest in any women's 200m event in the swimming history! In 1996, Egerszegi did not enter the 100m backstroke, however her leadoff backstroke time in the medley relay, 1:01.15, was faster than the winning time in the 100m backstroke final.  , Between 1988 and 1996 she won 5 individual Olympic gold medals , which was a record for a swimmer for individual gold medal wins. This record has since been broken by Michael Phelps , who has to date won 11 individual gold medals. Egerszegi still holds the record with 5 individual Olympic gold medals as the most of any female swimmers in the history of the sport. , Egerszegi announced her retirement from swimming soon after the Olympic games, at the age of only 22. In the same year, she became the board member of the Hungarian Swimming Association and in 2007 the member of the Hungarian Olympic Committee. , Her 1988 winning in Seoul became one of the biggest TV-moments in Hungary. The famous phrase "Come on Little Mouse! Come on little girl!" ("Gyerünk Egérke! Gyerünk kicsi lány!") by Tamás Vitray, who was the speaker on the air, is part of the popular culture. Egerszegi is still regarded as the role model of the "champion" in the country. , Her nickname was "Egérke" ("Little Mouse") or "Egér" ("Mouse"), a play on her surname, because of her youthfulness and size. After the 1992 Summer Olympics , where she was the most won three individual gold medals and became the only female athlete at the Games to do so, she was called as Krisztina Királynő ("Queen Kristina") both in the Hungarian and in some international media. , In 1993, László Ládonyi and György Volly published a biographical book "Egerszegi" about her career. , In 2000, a documentary film called Egerszegi was made about her swimming career.  , She was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 2001.  She was named Hungarian Sportswoman of the Year on a record-breaking seven occasions (1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993 and 1996) and Female World Swimmer of the Year three times. , Krisztina Egerszegi, one of the most prominent FINA athletes of all times, was awarded the Olympic Order on June 23, 2001, during the celebration of the Olympic Day by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in Lausanne (SUI). , On August 20, 2013, Krisztina Egerszegi has been awarded with the highest State Order of Hungary, the Order of Saint Stephen Hungary Medal by the President of the Republic of Hungary János Áder in the Sándor Palace in Budapest.  , ,  Dara Grace Torres (born April 15, 1967) is an American former competition swimmer who is a twelve-time Olympic medalist and former world record-holder in three events. Torres is the first and only swimmer to represent the United States in five Olympic Games (1984, 1988, 1992, 2000 and 2008), and, at age 41, was the oldest swimmer ever to earn a place on the U.S. Olympic team. At the 2008 Summer Olympics , she competed in the 50-meter freestyle , 4×100-meter medley relay , and 4×100-meter freestyle relay, and won silver medals in all three events. , Torres has won twelve Olympic medals (four gold, four silver, four bronze), one of three women with the most Olympic women's swimming medals. She won five medals at the 2000 Summer Olympics when, at age 33, she was the oldest member of the 2000 U.S. Olympic Swim Team. She has also won at least one medal in each of the five Olympics in which she has competed, making her one of only a handful of Olympians to earn medals in five different Games. , , , Torres was born in Los Angeles, California , the daughter of Edward Torres and Marylu Kauder.  Her father was a Cuban -born real estate developer and casino owner; her mother Marylu was a former model.   Torres grew up in Beverly Hills, California , the fifth of six children and the older of two girls.  As a 7-year-old, she followed in the footsteps of her older brothers by joining their community Y.M.C.A. for swimming practice; afterward, she signed up for the swimming club in Culver City to train.  At 14, she won the national open championship in the 50-yard freestyle by defeating the then-current champion, Jill Sterkel , a college junior.  , She attended the Westlake School for Girls (now Harvard-Westlake School ),  and competed for the Westlake swim team under coach Darlene Bible from the seventh grade through her sophomore year in high school.  She was also a member of the Westlake basketball, gymnastics and volleyball teams.  During her 1983–84 high school junior year, she left home to swim for the Mission Viejo Nadadores in Mission Viejo, California , while training for her first Olympics under coach Mark Schubert .  After the 1984 Olympics, Torres returned to the Westlake School to graduate in 1985.  , Torres accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where she swam for the Florida Gators swimming and diving team in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) competition under coach Randy Reese from 1986 to 1989.  In her four years as a Gator swimmer, Torres won nine Southeastern Conference (SEC) individual championships, including the 50-yard freestyle (1987, 1988, 1989), 100-yard freestyle (1987, 1988, 1989), 200-yard freestyle (1987), and 100-yard butterfly (1988, 1989); she was also a member of twelve of the Gators' SEC championship relay teams.  Torres won three NCAA individual national championships (50-yard freestyle, 100-yard freestyle, 100-yard butterfly) in 1988; and was a member of six of the Gators' NCAA championship relay teams, including the 400-yard freestyle relay in 1986; the 200-yard and 400-yard medley relays, and the 400-yard freestyle relay in 1988; and the 200-yard and 400-yard medley relays in 1989.  She was named the SEC Athlete of the Year in 1988, SEC Female Swimmer of the Year in 1987 and 1989, and earned twenty-eight All-American swimming honors—the maximum number possible during a college career.   Torres also lettered in volleyball at Florida, playing the sport in her fifth year after having exhausted her NCAA eligibility in swimming.  , Torres graduated from the university with a bachelor's degree in telecommunications in 1990, and was inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as a "Gator Great" in 1999.   In November 2013, she was named as a recipient of the 2014 NCAA Silver Anniversary Award , presented annually to six distinguished former student-athletes on the 25th anniversary of their final school year of athletic eligibility.  , At the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, Torres was a member of the winning U.S. women's 4×100-meter freestyle relay team, swimming in the first-round qualifying heat and earning a gold medal in the event final.  Her winning teammates in that final included Nancy Hogshead , Jenna Johnson and Carrie Steinseifer ; Jill Sterkel and Mary Wayte also swam in the event's second-round qualifying heat.  , For the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, Torres qualified for the U.S. Olympic women's team in one individual event and two relay events. Torres earned a bronze medal for swimming for the third-place U.S. women's team in the 4×100-meter freestyle relay final, together with teammates Mitzi Kremer , Laura Walker and Mary Wayte .   She also earned a silver medal for swimming the freestyle leg of the 4×100-meter medley relay for the second-place U.S. team in the preliminary heats, but not the final.  Individually, Torres also placed seventh in the final of the 100-meter freestyle event.  , Torres qualified for the U.S. Olympic women's team in a single event for the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. She swam the second leg of the 4×100-meter freestyle relay for the winning U.S. team that included Nicole Haislett , Angel Martino and Jenny Thompson , and earned a gold medal for her efforts in the event final and first-round qualifying heat.   , After seven years out of competitive swimming, Torres began to train for an Olympic comeback in 1999 under the guidance of coach Richard Quick .  She won five medals at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, but saved her best for two of the major relay events of the U.S. Olympic women's team.   She swam the second leg for the winning U.S. women's team in final of the 4×100-meter freestyle relay that included Amy Van Dyken , Courtney Shealy and Jenny Thompson .  Torres won a second gold medal for anchoring the winning U.S. team in the 4×100-meter medley relay , together with teammates B.J. Bedford, Megan Quann and Jenny Thompson in the final.  Individually, Torres also earned bronze medals – her first Olympic medals in individual events – in each of the 50-meter freestyle , the 100-meter butterfly and the 100-meter freestyle ,   tying teammate and rival Jenny Thompson for third place in the last event.   At 33 years old, Torres became the oldest woman to win an Olympic medal in swimming.  She was the oldest member of the U.S. Olympic swim team, but won more medals (5) than any other U.S. team member.   , On August 1, 2007, at age 40 and just 16 months after giving birth to her first child, Torres won the 100-meter freestyle at the U.S. Nationals in Indianapolis.  On August 4, she set a new American record in the 50-meter freestyle of 24.53 seconds, breaking her own record of 24.63 seconds set at the 2000 Summer Olympics.  She lowered her initial American record by 1.62 seconds. Torres has broken or lowered her own American record in the 50-meter freestyle ten times, which is the most by any American swimmer in any event.  , At the 2008 U.S. Olympic Trials , Torres returned to the pool and qualified for a spot in her fifth Olympic Games at the age of 41, unprecedented for an American female swimmer.  She became the oldest U.S. Olympic swimmer in history and the first American swimmer to appear in five Olympic Games.  , At the trials, she qualified for the event finals in the 50-meter freestyle and broke the American record with a time of 24.38 seconds in the semifinal.  In the 50-meter finals, she broke that record for the ninth time, setting it at 24.25 seconds and winning the top American women's spot in the event.  Torres also qualified in the 100-meter freestyle,  but later withdrew from the individual 100-meter freestyle event to focus her efforts on the 50-meter freestyle and 4x100-meter relay events.  On July 30, at the U.S. swim team's final training in Singapore, Torres, Amanda Beard and Natalie Coughlin were elected captains of the U.S. Olympic women's swimming team.  , In order to pre-empt any speculation that she might be taking performance-enhancing drugs, Torres volunteered for a new enhanced drug-testing program by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA).  "I want to be an open book", she said. "I want people to know that I'm 41, and I'm doing this right. I'm clean."  In addition to employing her training team of coach Michael Lohberg, a sprint coach, a chiropractor and two masseuses, Torres used resistance stretching trainers, calling it her "secret weapon" for continued success.   Her $100,000-per-year training costs were partially subsidized by her corporate sponsors Speedo , Toyota and Bloomberg L.P.  , At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Torres won a silver medal as the anchor swimmer of the second-place U.S. team in the 4×100-meter freestyle relay .  It was the fifth time in five tries she earned an Olympic medal in the 4x100-meter freestyle relay.  With the American relay team's second-place finish, she became the oldest swimmer to win a medal in Olympic history, surpassing British swimmer William Robinson , who was 38 at the time of the 1908 Summer Olympics.  , On August 17, 2008, she won the silver medal in the 50-meter freestyle , finishing in a new American record time of 24.07 seconds, one one-hundredth (0.01) of a second behind the winner, Britta Steffen .  Her second-place time was a new American record, and 0.18 of a second faster than she swam at the U.S. Olympic Trials.  Thirty-five minutes later, she won another silver medal swimming the freestyle anchor leg for the second-place U.S. team in the 4×100-meter medley relay .  Her split on the 4×100 medley relay (52.27 seconds) was the fastest 100-meter freestyle split in relay history.  The American record for the women's 100-meter freestyle as an individual event was 53.39 seconds as of August 2008, making Torres' time more than a full second faster.  , Torres' twelve Olympic medals tied the all-time medal record for a female Olympic swimmer set by fellow American Jenny Thompson in 2004; American Natalie Coughlin subsequently equaled the record in 2012.  , At the U.S. National Championships in 2009, Torres won the 50-meter freestyle with the fourth-best time in the world for the year (24.42), and she also placed in the 50-meter butterfly, qualifying her to compete in those events at the 2009 World Championships .  This was the first time since 1986 that Torres competed in the World Championships; she placed eighth in the 50-meter freestyle and she did not advance beyond the qualifying heats in the 50-meter butterfly. , Following reconstructive surgery of one of her knees, she began training with the goal of competing in the 2012 Summer Olympics .  At the 2012 United States Olympic Trials , she placed fourth in the finals of the 50-meter freestyle, 0.32 of a second behind the winner, Jessica Hardy , and 0.09 of a second behind the second qualifier, Kara Lynn Joyce .   Only the top two finishers in each trials event qualified for the 2012 U.S. Olympic Team, and as a result, Torres concluded her Olympic career.  After the 2012 Trials, Torres announced her retirement from competitive swimming, concluding her career with 12 Olympic medals.  Her Olympic career spanned twenty-four years from 1984 to 2008 and five Olympic Games (1984, 1988, 1992, 2000, 2008).  , Torres has worked in television as a reporter and announcer for American networks NBC , ESPN , TNT , OLN and Fox News Channel , and hosted the golf show The Clubhouse on the Resort Sports Network .  She has also worked as a model, and was the first elite swimmer to model swimwear in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue , appearing in the 1994 edition.  She was elected to the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 2005.  , After 1992, she married and subsequently divorced sports producer Jeff Gowen.  After 2000, she married Israeli-born surgeon Itzhak Shasha, after converting to Judaism before the marriage (her father had been Jewish).  Torres and Shasha later divorced.  Torres and reproductive endocrinologist David Hoffman began dating after her break-up with Shasha, and they became the parents of Tessa Grace Torres-Hoffman, born in 2006.  After the birth of their daughter, Hoffman, a masters swimmer, persuaded her to begin training again.  , Torres is a veteran celebrity swimmer for Swim Across America , a charitable organization that raises funds for cancer research in which she has participated for several years.  She is the author of two books: Age is Just a Number: Achieve Your Dreams at Any Stage in Your Life (with Elizabeth Weil), and Gold Medal Fitness: A Revolutionary 5-Week Program (with Billie Fitzpatrick).  , Women's 50-meter freestyle , Women's 4x100-meter freestyle relay , Women's 4x100-meter medley relay , ,  Dawn Fraser , AO ,  MBE (born 4 September 1937) is an Australian champion swimmer and former politician. She is one of only three swimmers to have won the same Olympic event three times – in her case the 100-metre freestyle.  , Within Australia, during her swimming career she was often known for her controversial behaviour and larrikin character as much as for her athletic ability. She outgrew that reputation and received many honours after her competitive swimming career ended. , , , Fraser was born in the Sydney suburb of Balmain in 1937 into a working-class family. She was spotted at the early age of 14 by Sydney coach Harry Gallagher swimming at the local sea baths. , Fraser won eight Olympic medals, including four gold medals, and six Commonwealth Games gold medals. She also held 39 records. The 100 metres freestyle record was hers for 15 years from 1 December 1956 to 8 January 1972. , She is the first of only three swimmers in Olympic history ( Krisztina Egerszegi of Hungary and Michael Phelps of the United States being the two others) to have won individual gold medals for the same event at three successive Olympics (100 metres freestyle – 1956, 1960, 1964) . , In October 1962, she became the first woman to swim 100 metres freestyle in less than one minute.  It was not until 1973, eight years after Fraser retired, that her 100m record of 58.9 secs was broken.  , During the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Fraser angered swimming team sponsors and the Australian Swimming Union (ASU) by marching in the opening ceremony against their wishes, and wearing an older swimming costume in competition because it was more comfortable than the one supplied by the sponsors. She was accused of stealing an Olympic flag from a flagpole outside Emperor Hirohito 's palace from the Kōkyo . She was arrested but released without charge. In the end she was given the flag as a souvenir.  However, the Australian Swimming Union suspended her for 10 years. They relented a few months before the 1968 Games but by then it was too late for Fraser, at 31, to prepare. , She later denied having swum the moat to steal the flag, telling The Times in 1991: "There's no way I would have swum that moat. I was terrified of dirty water and that moat was filthy. There's no way I'd have dipped my toe in it." , Fraser became a publican at the Riverview Hotel , Balmain, and took up swimming coaching. In 1988, she was elected an independent Member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly (MLA) for the seat of Balmain . Fraser left politics when the seat was abolished in 1991 and she failed to win the new seat of Port Jackson .   Fraser is a high profile supporter and a board director of the Wests Tigers NRL club.  , She was named the Australian of the Year in 1964,  was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1965,  was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1967,  and appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in 1998.  Also in 1998, she was voted Australia's greatest female athlete in history. [ citation needed ] She was named Australian Female Athlete of the Century by the Sport Australia Hall of Fame ,  who had inducted her as their first female member in 1985.  In 1999 the International Olympic Committee named her the World's Greatest Living Female Water Sports Champion. [ citation needed ] on 14 July 2000, Fraser was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for "outstanding contribution as a swimming competitor".  , She was one of the bearers of the Olympic Torch at the opening ceremony of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. She carried the Olympic Torch at the stadium, as one of the bearers for the final segment, before the lighting of the Olympic Flame . , The Australian Sport Awards includes an award named in honour of and presented by Fraser. In 1992, the State Transit Authority named a RiverCat ferry after Fraser. , In 1979, a movie called Dawn! was made about Fraser's life and career. It starred Bronwyn Mackay-Payne as Fraser. , Fraser was played by Melissa Thomas in the 2003 film Swimming Upstream . Fraser herself is credited in the film as Dawn Fraser's coach. , Fraser married Gary Ware on 30 January 1965 at St Stephens Church, Macquarie Street, Sydney.  The marriage was short-lived. She has one daughter from the marriage, Dawn-Lorraine, who has a son, Jackson.    Kornelia Ender (born 25 October 1958 in Plauen , Saxony ) is a former East German swimmer who at the 1976 Summer Olympics became the first woman swimmer to win four gold medals at a single Olympic Games, all in world record times. It was later proven that the East German team doctors had systematically administered steroids to their athletes  (albeit without the athletes' knowledge). As an athlete who had exhibited symptoms of steroid use in 1976 (deep voice, overdeveloped body), strong suspicion was cast on the validity of Ender's accomplishments. , Ender trained from a young age and won her first Olympic medals as a 13-year-old at the 1972 Olympics in Munich : three silver medals, including one in the individual 200 m individual medley, finishing behind Australia 's Shane Gould . Over the following years she broke 32 world records in individual events, including the four at the Montreal Games . In 1991, she addressed the long-held suspicions about her physical condition at the 1976 Games, acknowledging that team doctors and coaches had given her numerous injections of drugs over the preceding months. Ender said that she did not know at the time, nor had she ever subsequently found out, exactly what the drugs were. She said she was told only that the drugs would help her "regenerate and recuperate", and therefore, although she was surprised by the muscle mass she added, she nonetheless attributed it simply to her rigorous training. , Ender was married for four years to East German backstroke swimmer and multiple Olympic champion Roland Matthes . She is now married to former East German - German track and field athlete and bobsledder Steffen Grummt .  Inge de Bruijn ( Dutch pronunciation: [ˈɪŋə də ˈbrœyn] ; born 24 August 1973) is a Dutch former swimmer. She is a four-time Olympic champion and a former world record holder. , , , De Bruijn was born in Barendrecht , Netherlands , and tried several sports before eventually specializing in swimming. , De Bruijn debuted at the World Aquatics Championships in January 1991, winning a bronze medal with the 4×100 m relay team, with which she won the gold medal at the European LC Championships in August of that year. , The following year, de Bruijn made her Olympic debut at the 1992 Summer Olympics , and finished 8th in the 100 m and 4×100 m freestyle events. She did not compete at the 1996 Summer Olympics . In 1999, she won the 50 m freestyle at the European Championships. The following year, after having swum several 50 m freestyle world records , she competed in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia.
