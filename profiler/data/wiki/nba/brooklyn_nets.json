They are a member of the league's Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference . The team was established in 1967 as a charter franchise of the NBA's rival league, the American Basketball Association (ABA). They were known as the New Jersey Americans during their first season, before moving to Long Island in 1968 and changing their name to the New York Nets . During this time, the Nets won two ABA championships (in 1974 and 1976). In 1976, the ABA merged with the NBA, and the Nets were absorbed into the NBA along with three other ABA teams (the San Antonio Spurs , Indiana Pacers and Denver Nuggets , all of whom remain in the league today). , In 1977, the team returned to the nearby state of New Jersey and played as the New Jersey Nets from 1977 to 2012. During this time, the Nets won two consecutive Eastern Conference championships (in the 2001–02 and 2002–03 seasons), but failed to win a championship. In the summer of 2012, the team moved to the Barclays Center in Brooklyn and was renamed the Brooklyn Nets.  , , , The Brooklyn Nets were founded in 1967 and initially played in Teaneck, New Jersey , as the New Jersey Americans . In its early years, the team led a nomadic existence, moving to Long Island in 1968 and playing in various arenas there as the New York Nets .  , Led by Hall of Famer Julius \"Dr. J\" Erving , the Nets won two ABA championships in New York before becoming one of four ABA teams to be admitted into the NBA as part of the ABA–NBA merger in 1976. The team then moved back to New Jersey in 1977 and became the New Jersey Nets . During their time in that state, the Nets saw periods of losing and misfortune intermittent with several periods of success, which culminated in two consecutive NBA Finals appearances in the 2001–02 and 2002–03 seasons by teams led by point guard Jason Kidd . , After playing 35 seasons in New Jersey, the team moved back to the state of New York, changed its geographic name to Brooklyn, and began playing in the new Barclays Center , starting with the 2012–13 NBA season .   , The Boston Celtics were once rivals of the Nets during the early 2000s because of their respective locations and their burgeoning stars. The Nets were led by Jason Kidd and Kenyon Martin, while the Celtics were experiencing newfound success behind Paul Pierce and Antoine Walker. The rivalry began to heat up in the 2002 Eastern Conference Finals, which was preceded by trash-talking from the Celtics  who claimed Martin was a \"fake\" tough guy. Things progressed as the series started, and on-court tensions seemed to spill into the stands. Celtic fans berated Kidd and his family with chants of \"Wife Beater!\"  in response to Kidd's 2001 domestic abuse charge. When the series returned to New Jersey, Nets fans responded, with some brandishing signs that read \"Will someone please stab Paul Pierce?\"  referring to a night club incident in 2000 in which Pierce was stabbed 11 times. When asked about the fan barbs being traded, Kenyon Martin stated, \"Our fans hate them, their fans hate us.\" Bill Walton said at the time that Nets-Celtics was the \"beginning of the next great NBA rivalry\" during the Eastern Conference Finals in 2002 with the Nets advancing to the NBA Finals, though New Jersey would go on to sweep Boston in the 2003 playoffs. , In 2012, there were indications that the rivalry might be rekindled when an altercation occurred on the court on November 28, resulting in the ejection of Rajon Rondo , Gerald Wallace, and Kris Humphries. Rondo was suspended for two games in the aftermath, while Wallace and Kevin Garnett were fined.  The story was revisited on December 25, when Wallace grabbed Garnett's shorts and the two had to be broken up by referees and players alike. , However, the rivalry between the Nets and the Celtics appeared significantly cooled off by the June 2013 blockbuster trade that dealt Celtics stars Garnett and Paul Pierce to the Nets in exchange for Wallace, Humphries, and others. This move was billed as a merger of the two Atlantic Division teams.  Celtics announcer Sean Grande said \"It's almost as if you found a great home for these guys. You couldn't have found a better place. These guys will be in the New York market, they'll be on a competitive team, they'll stay on national TV. It's funny, because the enemy of my enemy is my friend. So with Celtics fans feeling the way they do about the Heat , feeling the way they do about the Knicks , the Nets are going to become almost the second [Boston] team now.\"  , The Knicks–Nets rivalry has historically been a geographical one, with the Knicks playing in Madison Square Garden in the New York City borough of Manhattan and the Nets playing in the New York City suburbs of Long Island and in New Jersey , and since 2012, at Barclays Center in the New York City borough of Brooklyn . Media outlets have noted the Knicks–Nets rivalry's similarity to those of other New York City teams, such as Major League Baseball 's Subway Series rivalry between the American League 's New York Yankees and the National League 's New York Mets and National Football League 's rivalry between the NFC East 's New York Giants and the AFC East 's New York Jets , the result of the boroughs' proximity through the New York City Subway . Historically, the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn competed via the Dodgers–Giants rivalry , when the two teams were known as the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants . Like the Knicks and Nets, the Giants and Dodgers played in Manhattan and Brooklyn, respectively, and were fierce divisional rivals.  The rivalry between the New York Islanders and New York Rangers of the National Hockey League will also have this distinction once the Islanders move to Barclays Center in 2015.  Due to the Knicks being located in Manhattan and the Nets being located in Brooklyn, some media outlets have dubbed this rivalry \"Clash of the Boroughs\".   , A rivalry with the Toronto Raptors had emerged in 2004, when then-Raptor Vince Carter had been traded to the then-New Jersey Nets.  However, the two teams would not meet in the playoffs until 2007 , when the Nets defeated the Raptors in the First Round series, 4–2, after a go-ahead shot by Richard Jefferson with 8 seconds left in Game 6 led to a 98–97 victory.  Seven years later , the two teams would meet once again in the First Round, where the series would end in Game 7, after a game-winning block by Paul Pierce , giving the Nets the 104–103 victory.  The series was also noted for controversy when Toronto Raptor's General Manager Masai Ujiri made derogatory remarks towards Brooklyn at a fan rally outside Maple Leaf Square before Game 1. Ujiri later apologized at halftime.  , The mascot of the New Jersey Nets was Sly the Silver Fox , who debuted on October 31, 1997 as part of the rebranding of the Nets for the 1997–98 season .  Prior to that, the Nets' mascot was an anthropomorphic dragon named Duncan the Dragon .  , The Nets introduced a new super hero mascot for their move to Brooklyn named BrooklyKnight (a play on the demonym Brooklynite) on November 3, 2012 – he was lowered from the ceiling of the Barclays Center amid sparks and fanfare and introduced by Nets PA announcer David Diamante: \"Here to defend Brooklyn, he's the BrooklyKnight.\" The mascot was co-created by Marvel Entertainment , a sister company to NBA broadcasters ABC and ESPN . A 32-page comic book titled BrooklyKnight #1 , written by Jason Aaron and drawn by Mike Deodato Jr. , was released by Marvel to commemorate the unveiling of the mascot.  After the Nets' second season in Brooklyn, the franchise decided to discontinue the BrooklyKnight mascot.  , On November 3, 2012, the Nets introduced a new team anthem titled \"Brooklyn: Something To Lean On\", written and recorded by Brooklyn-born musician John Forté .  The song is notable for its refrain, which features the \"Brooklyn\" chant that has been popular with fans in Barclays Center.  , The Nets' front office in 2013 included Mikhail Prokhorov (Principal Owner), Brett Yormark (CEO, Brooklyn Nets), Billy King (General Manager), and Jeff Gewirtz (Executive Vice President, Business Affairs & Chief Legal Officer).  , The original owner of the Nets franchise was trucking magnate Arthur J. Brown, who was the founder of the American Basketball Association team that was then known as the New Jersey Americans in 1967. The next year, Brown renamed the franchise to the New York Nets following a move to Long Island, and sold the team for $1.1 million to entrepreneur Roy Boe .  Due to financial losses suffered while the team was in Long Island, Boe moved the team back to New Jersey in 1977 and sold the team a year later to a group of seven local businessmen led by Alan N. Cohen and Joseph Taub, who became known as the \" Secaucus Seven\".  , After a lengthy ownership of the franchise and numerous attempts to improve the financial situation of the team, the \"Secaucus Seven\" finally sold the team in 1998 to a group of local real estate developers led by Raymond Chambers and Lewis Katz ,  who called themselves the \"Community Youth Organization\" (CYO) and wanted to move the team to Newark, New Jersey . The next year the group signed an agreement with New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner to form YankeeNets , a holding company that would own the two teams, and later also the New Jersey Devils , and increase leverage in future broadcast contracts by negotiating together. After receiving offers from numerous broadcast partners, including what was then their current rights holder Cablevision , YankeeNets decided to launch its own regional sports television called the YES Network . , YankeeNets would ultimately fail in its attempts to secure a deal with Newark to construct a new arena in the city. By that point in time, tensions between the management of the Yankees, Nets, and the Devils had cause a rift between them, and a decision was made to split the group up.  With their plan to move the Nets now dead, the CYO placed the team on sale. After a short bidding process, the group secured a deal with real estate developer Bruce Ratner to buy the team for $300 million, defeating a similar offer by Charles Kushner and Senator Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey. Ratner had purchased the team with the intent of moving it to a new arena in Brooklyn , which was to be a centerpiece of the large-scale Atlantic Yards development.  , On September 24, 2009, Mikhail Prokhorov , Russia's third-richest man according to Forbes , confirmed his intention to become majority owner of the Nets. Prokhorov sent an offer to the team owners requesting that the control shareholding of the basketball club be sold to his company, Onexim, for a symbolic price. In return, Prokhorov would fund a loan for the construction of a $700 million arena in Brooklyn and attract additional funds from Western banks. Prokhorov stated that he initiated the deal to help push Russian basketball to a new level of development.  On May 11, 2010, following approval from the other owners of the NBA, Prokhorov had become a principal owner of the Nets.  , The Nets' training center, and the headquarters for the team's basketball operations, have been located at the 65,000-square-foot PNY Center in East Rutherford, NJ, since 1998.  Prior to that, the team had practiced at the APA Recreation Center in North Bergen , NJ, sharing their lockers and practice courts with truck drivers who used the facility.  In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in November 2012, PNY Center suffered power outage and extensive water damage due to flooding, and for several months, the team used the smaller training spaces and practice courts inside the Barclays Center instead.  , On June 26, 2014, the Nets announced their intention to move their training center to the Industry City complex in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn. The new facility, to be known as the Hospital for Special Surgery Training Center (HSS Center), will be built on the roof of an empty warehouse in the complex, occupying 70,000 square feet of space in total. The renovation project will cost roughly $50 million.  , The Nets hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who isn't signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.  This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. , Bold denotes still active with team. Italics denotes still active but not with team. \"Name*\" includes points scored for the team while in the ABA. , Points scored (regular season) (as of the end of the 2014-15 season)  , Other Statistics (regular season) (as of the end of the 2014-15 season)  , Minutes Played , Rebounds , Assists , Steals , Blocks , *Not in the rafters. , *Played or coached for the franchise during its time in the ABA. , NBA Rookie of the Year , NBA Executive of the Year , ABA Most Valuable Player Award , ABA Playoffs Most Valuable Player , ABA Rookie of the Year Award , NBA All-Star Game , NBA All-Star Game head coaches , All-NBA First Team , All-NBA Second Team , All-NBA Third Team , NBA All-Defensive First Team , NBA All-Defensive Second Team , All-ABA Team First Team , All-ABA Team Second Team , ABA All-Defensive Team , NBA Rookie First Team , NBA Rookie Second Team , ABA All-Rookie Team , Starting in the 2011–12 season, the Springfield Armor had become the exclusive NBA Development League affiliate of the Nets. This made the Nets the second team to opt for a D-League \"hybrid affiliation\", the first being the Houston Rockets with the Rio Grande Valley Vipers . Springfield ownership had maintained control over business, marketing, and day-to-day operations; however, the Brooklyn Nets had control over coaching and player decisions. This hybrid model was well received by GMs and owners.  However, after three seasons, the Pistons had purchased the Armor from the Nets, moving and renaming the team as the Grand Rapids Drive .  , The television home of the Nets is currently the YES Network , which the team helped create while they were under the corporate umbrella of YankeeNets LLC , a merger of business operations between the Nets and the New York Yankees . After the dissolution of YankeeNets and Bruce Ratner's purchase of the team, YES signed a long-term deal to keep broadcasting Nets games. The sale to the Ratner group did not include the percentage of YES that was previously owned by the Nets, which remains with the pre-merger Nets owners. Prior to that, the Nets' TV home was Fox Sports Net New York and SportsChannel New York . , The team's local broadcast partner is WWOR-TV , and games have aired on WLNY in the past as well. , The current flagship radio station of the Nets is WFAN , which took over the radio rights to the Nets after losing their basketball contract with the Knicks (who moved to WEPN ). Prior to that, Nets games aired on WNEW , WMCA , WVNJ , WNBC , WQEW , and WOR . , In the club's early ABA years, some Sunday road games were televised in a package carried by WPIX-TV . The team's later ABA tenure featured more frequent road telecasts on their current broadcast partner, WWOR-TV. Known then as WOR-TV, it continued airing road games for a time once the team joined the NBA in 1976. , Ian Eagle has television duties for the Nets after the departure of Marv Albert in 2011. Eagle became the lead television voice for the team in 1995 after serving as the team's radio voice for one year, while Albert joined the Nets following his firing by MSG Network in 2005 after four decades as the lead voice of the New York Knicks . When Albert joined the broadcast team, he became the lead broadcaster with Eagle as his substitute; beginning in the 2009–10 season, due to Albert's advancing age and his other commitments, Eagle once again assumed the lead play-by-play spot. As of the 2011–12 season, Eagle is the sole lead announcer after Albert decided to move to CBS Sports for both NFL and NCAA basketball , in addition to his work on the NBA on TNT . Ryan Ruocco substitutes for Eagle during the latter's CBS NFL and NCAA commitments. , Joining Eagle in the booth for 2013 are former NBA player and ex-Net Donny Marshall and longtime Nets analyst Jim Spanarkel . Marshall replaced Mike Fratello as the lead analyst following the 2012–13 season and Spanarkel shares duties with him as he has in the past with other announcers. , WFAN is the Nets' current radio flagship, the station having assumed radio rights from WOR following the 2003–04 season. Chris Carrino and Tim Capstraw comprise the broadcast team, Carrino on play-by-play and Capstraw as the analyst. , Other broadcasters who have worked for the Nets include Howard David , Bob Papa , Bill Raftery , Kelly Tripucka , Albert King , Mike O'Koren, Spencer Ross , Mel Proctor , Joe Tait , John Sterling , Mike DiTomasso , WFAN update man John Minko and Mark Jackson . , Nets games have also aired on WNEW-AM and WQEW in the past. , During the club's ABA years, announcers included Marty Glickman , Marv Albert's brothers Al Albert and Steve Albert , baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Bob Gibson , Bob Goldsholl, as well as Sterling and DiTomasso. The latter two joined the club's move into the NBA. "
