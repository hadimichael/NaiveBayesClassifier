They are part of the Southwest Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Grizzlies play their home games at FedExForum . The team owner is Robert Pera . , The team was established as the Vancouver Grizzlies in Vancouver , British Columbia in 1995. They relocated to Memphis in 2001. The Grizzlies are the only team in the four major professional leagues based in Memphis. , , , The Vancouver Grizzlies were a Canadian professional basketball team based in Vancouver , British Columbia . They were part of the Midwest Division of the Western Conference of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The team was established in 1995, along with the Toronto Raptors , as part of the NBA's expansion into Canada. Following the 2000–01 season, the team relocated to Memphis, Tennessee , United States , and were renamed as the Memphis Grizzlies. The Grizzlies played their home games at General Motors Place for the entirety of their 6 seasons in Vancouver. , The Vancouver Grizzlies applied with the NBA to relocate to Memphis on March 26, 2001 and it was granted. As a result, the Grizzlies became the first major professional sports team from the \"big four\" major pro sports leagues to permanently play its home games in Memphis, as well as leaving the Toronto Raptors to be the only Canadian basketball team in the NBA. Memphis became the easternmost city in the Western Conference. In their first three seasons in Memphis, the Grizzlies played their home games at the Pyramid Arena . , In the 2001 NBA Draft , the Atlanta Hawks chose Pau Gasol as the 3rd overall pick, who was traded to the Grizzlies. Forward Shane Battier was selected with the 7th pick in the same draft by the Vancouver Grizzlies. They also acquired Jason Williams from the Sacramento Kings in exchange for Mike Bibby that same year. After the Grizzlies' first season in Memphis , Gasol won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award . The Grizzlies also drafted Shane Battier , who quickly became an unofficial spokesman for the team and a fan favorite. However, despite the strong draft class, general manager Billy Knight was let go. After Knight's departure and the season, the team hired former Los Angeles Laker and Hall of Famer Jerry West as general manager in 2002, who later received the 2003–04 NBA Executive of the Year Award .

During the 2002–03 season, Hubie Brown was hired to coach the Grizzlies. , Brown won the NBA Coach of the Year Award during the next season when the Grizzlies made the NBA playoffs for the first time in team history in 2004 as the sixth seed in the Western Conference in a drastic change from being perennially one of the worst teams in the NBA. They also won a then record 50 games under Gasol and Williams. In the playoffs they faced the San Antonio Spurs, who swept them out of the playoffs in four games. , However, Brown stepped down as head coach during the 2004–05 NBA season. At the time of his resignation, the Grizzlies had a losing record but West was able to hire TNT analyst and former coach Mike Fratello to replace Brown. The Grizzlies' record improved and the team advanced to the postseason for the second consecutive season. However, the Grizzlies were swept out in the first round again, this time by the Phoenix Suns . After the season, which ended with anger between Fratello and many of the players, namely Bonzi Wells and Jason Williams, the team had an active 2005 off-season in which they revamped the team and added veterans. While the Grizzlies lost Wells, Williams, Stromile Swift , and James Posey , they acquired Damon Stoudamire , Bobby Jackson , Hakim Warrick , and Eddie Jones . They made the playoffs for the third consecutive year as well. , With their record they had the fifth seed in the Western Conference playoffs and would face the Dallas Mavericks , who swept the Grizzlies in 4 games. , Following the 2006 NBA Draft , Jerry West traded Shane Battier to the Houston Rockets for their first round pick Rudy Gay and Stromile Swift .

Barone was the team's player personnel director and had never coached an NBA game though he had coached at the collegiate level for both Creighton and Texas A&M being named coach of the year in their conferences three times during his tenure. , The Grizzlies finished the 2006–07 season with a league-worst 22–60 record, and Jerry West announced his resignation from his position as the team's general manager shortly after the end of the regular season. The team also hired Marc Iavaroni , who was previously with the Phoenix Suns as an assistant coach, to be the team's new head coach. Despite the last-place finish, the Grizzlies, who held the best chance of landing the first pick, ended up with the fourth pick in the 2007 NBA draft , with which the Grizzlies selected Mike Conley, Jr. , On June 18, 2007, the Grizzlies named former Boston Celtics GM Chris Wallace as the team's General Manager and Vice President of Basketball Operations, replacing the retired West.

He was then waived by the Grizzlies.   Following Iverson's departure, the Grizzlies improved.
