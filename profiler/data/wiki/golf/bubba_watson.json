One of the few left-handed golfers on tour, he is a multiple major champion , having won the Masters Tournament in 2012 and 2014 .  In February 2015, Watson reached a career-high 2nd place in the Official World Golf Ranking . , Watson is among the longest drivers on the PGA Tour; in 2007 he had an average drive of 315.2 yards (288.2 m) and can hit a ball over 350 yards (320 m), capable of generating a ball speed up to 194 mph (312 km/h).   , , , Watson was born and raised in Bagdad, Florida , near Pensacola .

Watson played golf for Faulkner State Community College in nearby Baldwin County , Alabama , where he was a junior college All-American . He transferred to the University of Georgia , the defending NCAA champions , and played for the Bulldogs in 2000 and 2001. As a junior, Watson helped lead the Bulldogs to the SEC title in 2000. , Watson turned professional in 2003 and joined the Nationwide Tour where he played until 2005. He finished 21st on the Nationwide Tour's money list in 2005 , making him the last player to qualify for the following year's PGA Tour . As a rookie in 2006 , he earned $1,019,264 (90th overall) and led the PGA Tour in driving distance at 319.6 yards (292.2 m). His longest drive in professional competition was 442 yards (404 m) on the PGA Tour at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational . , Watson played well at the 2007 U.S. Open . He was in the final group on Saturday after shooting rounds of 70-71 (+1) at Oakmont Country Club near Pittsburgh . Watson was one stroke off the lead after 36 holes but then slipped, shooting 74 (+4) in both the third and fourth rounds; he finished in a tie for fifth. , Watson claimed his first PGA Tour win on June 27, 2010, in Cromwell, Connecticut , at the Travelers Championship on the second hole of a sudden-death playoff with Corey Pavin and Scott Verplank .  Watson tearfully dedicated the win to his parents, specifically his father who was battling cancer . , Watson was runner-up to Martin Kaymer at the PGA Championship at Whistling Straits , falling in the three-hole aggregate playoff that initially included Dustin Johnson , before he incurred a two-stroke penalty on the 72nd hole. Watson led the playoff after a birdie on the first hole, but Kaymer birdied the par-3 second hole to tie, effectively turning the playoff into sudden-death. Watson's second shot found the water hazard and Kaymer bested him by a stroke to win the major championship. , Watson had his own clothing line called \"Bubba Golf\" at the former Steve & Barry's . He was invited on The Ellen DeGeneres Show after he sent her a video of a golf trick shot he completed for her birthday. , On January 30, 2011 , Watson won his second PGA Tour event, the Farmers Insurance Open , finishing one stroke ahead of runner-up Phil Mickelson .  Watson picked up his second win of the 2011 season and third career PGA Tour title on May 1 when he defeated Webb Simpson at the second playoff hole at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans .  Both players birdied the first playoff hole, with Watson holing a 12-footer; he birdied the next hole to win the tournament. , In July 2011, Watson provoked controversy by criticizing the Alstom Open de France on the European Tour , in which he was playing under a sponsor's exemption. He indicated after his first round that he would not be playing any further events on the European Tour,  and complained after his second round about security and organization at the tournament.  , Watson took part in the Long Drive Contest for charity at the Hyundai Tournament of Champions alongside Dustin Johnson and Robert Garrigus . He finished in second place, with a longest drive of 370 yards (338 m) behind a drive of over 400 yards (366 m) by Jamie Sadlowski . , Watson began the year with three top-5 finishes in seven events, including finishing second at the WGC-Cadillac Championship .  , Watson's first major championship win came at the 2012 Masters Tournament . He began the final round at six-under-par, three strokes off the lead, held by Peter Hanson . On the back nine, Watson bogeyed the par-3 12th hole to return to even par for the round. He then recorded four consecutive birdies for a round of 68 (-4) and tied for the 72-hole lead with fourth-round playing partner Louis Oosthuizen at ten-under-par. In the sudden-death playoff, Oosthuizen and Watson both made par on the uphill 18th hole. On the next hole, the downhill 10th, both drove their tee shots towards the woods to the right of the hole. Oosthuizen's landed in the rough 220 yards (200 m) away, while Watson's ball landed deep in the woods on pine straw, 164 yards (150 m) from the pin without a clear shot to the green. Watson executed a miraculous recovery shot with 40 yards of hook on his 52-degree gap wedge and stopped the ball within fifteen feet of the hole. Oosthuizen's approach shot landed short of the green, but he chipped past the hole and narrowly missed his lengthy putt for par. Watson trickled his birdie putt a foot past the hole, took his time on the very short par putt, then made it for the emotional victory.   The win took him to a world ranking of four, a career-high at the time.  , Following his Masters win, Watson began to struggle. He missed the cut at the Memorial Tournament and the U.S. Open . A week after the U.S. Open, he finished tied for second at the Travelers Championship . A month later, he played The Open Championship , the third major of the year.

He finished the year with one win, six top-5 finishes, seven top-10 finishes and three missed cuts.  , Watson began the season playing the Hyundai Tournament of Champions , where he finished tied for fourth place, and reached the quarterfinals in the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship . In the subsequent World Golf Championship event, the WGC-Cadillac Championship , he began very strong with rounds of 66 and 69, but finished with rounds of 71 and 75 and tied for 18th place. , After finishing tied 14th place in the Arnold Palmer Invitational , he returned to the Masters Tournament as the defending champion. Never in contention in the tournament, he finished 50th after a final round of 77. Watson tied for 37th at The Players Championship . On the second major of the year, the U.S. Open , he finished with a solid 71 in the first round, just four shots off the lead, but a second round score of 76 left him out of contention, and he tied for 32nd. At the Travelers Championship he took the lead after a second round of 67, but in the final round, leading by one with three to play, he triple-bogeyed the par-3 16th and finished two shots back in 4th place. , Tying for 30th at the Greenbrier Classic , he then played in the third major of the year, The Open Championship . After two solids rounds of 70 and 73, he shot 77 in the third round, and tied for 32nd. , At the Waste Management Phoenix Open , Watson held the lead for most of the tournament, but he finished runner-up to Kevin Stadler . , Watson earned his fifth career PGA Tour victory—and his first since the 2012 Masters—at the 2014 Northern Trust Open . He shot back-to-back 64s over the weekend to defeat Dustin Johnson by two strokes.  The victory raised him to 14 in the Official World Golf Ranking. He followed that win with two more strong finishes—a ninth-place tie in the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship and a second-place tie in the WGC-Cadillac Championship .  Those performances elevated him from 14 to 12 in the world ranking.  , Watson won the 2014 Masters Tournament by three shots, with a score of −8.  He entered the final round tied for the lead with 20-year-old Masters rookie Jordan Spieth . Playing together in the final pairing, Spieth birdied the seventh hole for a two-stroke lead over Watson. However, the momentum turned on the par-5 eighth hole. Spieth had a birdie putt, but ended up three-putting for bogey while Watson birdied to pull into a first-place tie.  Then, on the ninth hole, Watson birdied again while Spieth bogeyed, and the four-shot swing over two holes gave Watson a lead that he never relinquished in a win over Spieth and Jonas Blixt .  With the win, Watson became the 17th player to win the Masters two or more times.  The win moved him again to number four in the Official World Golf Ranking.  , Watson was nicknamed by his father after the former professional football player Bubba Smith .  Watson is married to Angela P. \"Angie\" Watson, née Ball, a 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m) Canadian whom he met at Georgia while he was on the golf team and she was on the women's basketball team.   They were married in September 2004.  In 2009, Angie was diagnosed with an enlarged pituitary gland , which accounts for her height.  , On their first date, Angie told Bubba that she would be unable to conceive a child.
