The 16-under in relation to par beat Tiger Woods' 12 under at Pebble Beach Golf Links in 2000.    He became the youngest winner since Bobby Jones in 1923 . The victory lifted McIlroy's position in the Official World Golf Ranking to a then career high of number four.  , In preparation for the U.S. Open, McIlroy practised at Pine Valley Golf Club in New Jersey , rather than at Congressional, but did play two practice rounds at Congressional about a week before the start of the Open, after returning from a two-day trip to Haiti as an ambassador for UNICEF .   , On 17 June during the second round, McIlroy became the first player in the history of the tournament to reach a score of 13-under-par at any point in the tournament.

After 10 holes in the final match, McIlroy was 4 down to Mahan, but cut the deficit to 2 down through 16 holes. The 17th hole was halved with pars, securing the win for Mahan. There was anticipation surrounding the semi-final match between McIlroy and Westwood, as the winner would become the number one golfer in the world if they also won the final. McIlroy's runner-up finish moved him up to number two in the world while also putting him at the top of the Race to Dubai leaderboard. , The following week, McIlroy continued good form and won the Honda Classic in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida , and with it claimed the Number 1 spot in the world rankings.  He started the fourth round in first place at 11-under-par after rounds of 66-67-66, ahead of a chasing pack including Tiger Woods , Lee Westwood and Keegan Bradley .

Going into the back 9 on Sunday, he had a chance of winning his second title of 2012 in as many weeks due to the leaders faltering. However two late bogeys halted his chance and he settled for 3rd place, two strokes behind winner Justin Rose . , McIlroy lost his number one ranking on 18 March to Luke Donald after Donald won the Transitions Championship . McIlroy was one stroke off of the lead going into the weekend at The Masters but struggled in his last two rounds and finished in a tie for 40th.

After the runner-up finish, McIlroy would later miss the cut in his next three events, and fell again from number one ranking. , McIlroy won the 2012 PGA Championship by a record eight strokes, which was done with a birdie on the final hole.    The record stood since Jack Nicklaus won the 1980 PGA Championship by seven strokes.    McIlroy started the final round with a three stroke lead and shot a bogey free 66 to run away from the field.

With the win, he became the first European to win four PGA Tour events in a single season and the only person other than Tiger Woods to win four events in a season since 2005. , Following Europe's victory in the Ryder Cup, McIlroy turned his attention to winning the Race to Dubai. A second place at the BMW Masters was followed by a third place at the Barclays Singapore Open to wrap up the title with two events remaining. To finish off his season, he won the DP World Tour Championship, Dubai , making birdie on the last five holes to beat Justin Rose by two strokes.  He thus duplicated Luke Donald 's 2011 feat of winning both the PGA Tour and European Tour money titles in the same year. , McIlroy began 2013 with high aspirations, but mostly did not fare well in early tournaments. Struggling with the equipment change having signed a large endorsement deal with Nike in January, he withdrew from the Honda Classic in February, and finished in two over par and in a tie for 25th place at the 2013 Masters Tournament .  McIlroy won the 2013 Emirates Australian Open on the 72nd hole. He beat Australian Adam Scott by one stroke.  , In January, McIlroy was hit with a two-shot penalty for not taking proper and full relief after driving onto a spectator pathway in the Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship, his first event of the season. He was alerted to his mistake by Scottish caddie Dave Renwick after his round and, after signing for a 70 instead of a 68 to reflect the penalty, he told reporters: \"There are many stupid rules in golf and this is one of them.\" The two-shot penalty ultimately cost him dearly, as he lost the tournament by a single shot.  , In March, McIlroy lost in a four-man sudden-death playoff at the Honda Classic on the PGA Tour, despite leading the tournament through all four rounds until the back nine on Sunday. He shot a final round 74 (+4) and had a superb second shot to the par-five 18th in regulation play to qualify for the playoff, after missing the eagle putt for the win.

The following week, he won the PGA Championship at Valhalla for his fourth major, one shot ahead of runner-up Phil Mickelson .  After his victory Jack Nicklaus said: \"Rory is an unbelievable talent. I think Rory has an opportunity to win 15 or 20 majors or whatever he wants to do if he wants to keep playing. I love his swing, I love his rhythm, I love his moxie. He's got a little swagger there, it’s a little bit cocky but not offensive.\"  , McIlroy's second tournament of the year yielded victory as he won the European Tour's Omega Dubai Desert Classic for a second time.

You have individual goals and my goals are to win tournaments for myself.\"  European Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie responded by saying that the contest \"is not an exhibition and it never will be. It's a very unique, special event.\"  The following year, in 2010, McIlroy said that he regretted his earlier comments and said that the Ryder Cup is \"definitely not an exhibition\".  , In May 2011, McIlroy was criticised for skipping The Players Championship .

He also added that he would \"rather play when it's 80 degrees and sunny and not much wind\".  , On 28 July 2011, after being criticised on air by commentator Jay Townsend about McIlroy's questionable course management skills during the first round of the Irish Open , McIlroy wrote on Twitter telling Townsend to \"shut up\" and saying Townsend is a \"failed golfer\" and that \"his opinion meant nothing\".
