He currently resides in Fort Worth, Texas , United States. , , , Sabbatini was born in Durban , South Africa, and has Italian, Scottish and Irish ancestry.  He started playing golf at age 4, but concentrated on it from age 12. He was recruited by the University of Arizona , turned professional in 1998 and joined the PGA Tour in 1999. He was the youngest member of the tour that year. , During the first decade of the 2000s, Sabbatini had five PGA Tour wins; he finished 2006 placed 12th on the money list. In September 2007, he reached the top 10 of the Official World Golf Rankings for the first time,  with a high of 8th.   He spent over 20 weeks in the top-10 in 2007 and 2008.  , Sabbatini tied for second at the 2007 Masters Tournament  and the 2007 WGC-Bridgestone Invitational . He won the Par 3 Contest at the 2008 Masters Tournament .  , Sabbatini has represented South Africa in the World Cup five times and won the event with Trevor Immelman in 2003. , In his first Presidents Cup appearance in 2007, Sabbatini had a 0–3–1 record, as the International team was defeated by the United States team. , In May 2009 Sabbatini captured his fifth PGA Tour title by winning the HP Byron Nelson Championship by two strokes over Brian Davis . He broke the tournament record for scoring with a score of 269 (−19), beating the previous record of 270 (−18).  , In March 2011 Sabbatini won his sixth PGA Tour Title at The Honda Classic with a one stroke victory over South Korea's Y. E. Yang . Sabbatini entered the final round with a five stroke lead over the rest of the field, helped by a course record-equalling 64 on day two. He started his final round in solid fashion with an early birdie at the 3rd hole, however as the round progressed he made bogeys at the 9th and 14th, meaning that Yang was able to cut that lead to just one, with a spectacular tee shot on the par-three 15th that landed 18 inches past the pin. On the next hole though, Sabbatini holed a clutch birdie putt to tighten his grip on the title and played out the 17th and 18th in even-par to hold on for a one stroke victory. This win also secured him a place at the 2011 Masters Tournament . , In the final round of the 2005 Booz Allen Classic , apparently frustrated by the slow pace of play by his partner, Ben Crane , Sabbatini finished the 17th hole and walked over to the next tee, leaving Crane behind to complete the hole by himself. He received heavy criticism, and some sympathy, and later apologised for the incident.  , Sabbatini also made waves following the Wachovia Championship in May 2007 when, after leading the field by one stroke after day three and then giving up five strokes to Tiger Woods to lose the tournament on Sunday, he proclaimed that Woods was \"more beatable than ever.\"  In the final round of the 2007 Bridgestone Invitational , he had a fan removed who heckled him with questions about Tiger Woods.  Then, in December of the same year, more controversy was stirred when he withdrew from the Target World Challenge , an off-season event hosted by Tiger Woods, becoming the only player in history to withdraw from that event.  , In 2011, Sabbatini created more controversy when at the Northern Trust Open , after hitting his ball in the rough, a volunteer helped to locate the ball, but Sabbatini, thinking that the volunteer had moved his ball, yelled at him. He later apologised to avoid being penalised.  Later in 2011, at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans , Sabbatini got into a heated, profanity-laced argument with playing partner Sean O'Hair for undisclosed reasons. His penalty was also undisclosed because of the PGA Tour's policy. , PGA Tour playoff record (1–1) , Amateur , Professional "
