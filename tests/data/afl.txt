 The Australian Football League ( AFL ) is the highest-level professional competition in the sport of Australian rules football . Through the AFL Commission , the AFL also serves as the sport's governing body, and is responsible for controlling the Laws of the Game . The league was founded as the Victorian Football League (VFL) as a breakaway from the previous Victorian Football Association (VFA), with its inaugural season commencing in 1897. Originally comprising only teams based in the Australian state of Victoria, the competition's name was changed to the Australian Football League for the 1990 season, after expanding to other states throughout the 1980s. , The league currently consists of 18 teams spread over five of Australia's six states ( Tasmania being the exception). Matches have been played in all mainland states and territories of Australia , as well as in New Zealand . The AFL season currently consists of a pre-season competition (currently branded as the "NAB Challenge"), followed by a 23-round regular (or "home-and-away") season, which runs during the Australian winter (March to September). The top eight teams then play off in a four-round finals series , culminating in the AFL Grand Final , which is held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground each year. The winning team in the Grand Final is termed the " premiers ", and is awarded the premiership cup. The current premiers are Hawthorn . , The Victorian Football League was established in 1896 when six of the strongest clubs in Victoria – Collingwood, Essendon, Fitzroy, Geelong, Melbourne and South Melbourne – broke away from the established Victorian Football Association to establish the new league. The six clubs invited two more VFA clubs – Carlton and St Kilda – to join the league for its inaugural season in 1897. Among the notable initiatives established in the new league was an annual finals tournament, rather than awarding the premiership directly to the team with the best record through the season; and, the formal establishment of the modern scoring system, in which six points are scored for a goal, and one point is scored for a behind. , Although the Victorian Football League and the Victorian Football Association continued to compete for spectator interest for many years, the VFL quickly established itself as the premier competition in Victoria. In the early years Fitzroy and Collingwood were the dominant teams. Following the arrival of Jack Worrall as coach in 1903, Carlton began a dominating period, during which they won three successive flags from 1906 to 1908; although Worrall was the club secretary, he took on a player management and direction role which is today recognised as the first official coaching job in the league. Essendon won flags in 1911 and 1912, also under Jack Worrall's coaching. , In 1908, the league expanded to ten teams, with Richmond crossing from the VFA and University from the Metropolitan Football Association. University, after three promising seasons, finished last each year from 1911 until 1914, including losing 51 matches in a row; this was in part caused by its players' focus on their studies rather than football, particularly during examinations, and it was partly because the club operated on an amateur basis at a time when player payments were becoming common – and as a result, the club withdrew from the VFL at the end of 1914. University teams now compete in the Victorian Amateur Football Association .   , From 1907 until 1914, the VFL premier and the premier of the Adelaide-based South Australian Football League met in a playoff match for the Championship of Australia . Port Adelaide was the most successful club of the competition winning three titles during the period along with an earlier victory. , In 1919, the VFL established a seconds/reserves competition to run alongside the senior competition. In 1924 the VFL inaugurated the Brownlow Medal for the player who received the most votes from the umpires for the Best and Fairest player. Richmond won its first Premierships in 1920 and 1921 but Essendon – battlers since their 1912 flag – took over as the dominant team between 1922 and 1926. , In 1925, the VFL expanded from nine teams to twelve, with Footscray , Hawthorn and North Melbourne each crossing from the VFA. North Melbourne and Hawthorn remained very weak in the VFL for a very long period. North Melbourne did not win more than eight games in a season until 1944 and Hawthorn only once won more than seven until 1954. Between them, Hawthorn and North Melbourne finished in last place fifteen of the twenty-nine years from their admittance until 1953. Although North Melbourne would become the first of the 1925 expansion sides to reach a Grand Final in 1950 , initially it was Footscray that adapted to the VFL with the most ease of the three clubs, and by 1928 were well off the bottom of the ladder. , Between the years of 1927 and 1930, Collingwood became the first and so far, the only, team to win four successive Premierships. The club also finished the 1929 home-and-away season without losing a game, a feat yet to be repeated. This team became known as "the Machine" because of the organised and consistent way it played. With Premiership victories in 1935 and 1936, the Collingwood Football Club had already won 11 Premierships, four more than the next most successful club, Fitzroy (7). , In the 1930s, Richmond and South Melbourne rivaled Collingwood as the best team. Melbourne, which had won the Premiership in 1926 but fallen off sharply, developed a powerful attacking side that swept all before it between 1939 and 1941 to win three successive flags. Essendon, after a lean decade in the 1930s, enjoyed a dominant period with nine grand final appearances between 1941 and 1951. , In 1946, the VFL established an Under 19s grade of competition, to run alongside the seniors and reserves. In 1951, the McClelland Trophy was established as a prize for the best performing team across all three grades. In 1952, the VFL hosted 'National Day', when all six matches were played outside of Melbourne. Matches were played at the Sydney Cricket Ground, Brisbane Exhibition Ground , North Hobart Oval , Albury Sports Ground and Victorian country towns Yallourn and Euroa . , In 1959, the VFL planned the first purpose built mega-stadium, VFL Park (later known as Waverley Park), to give it some independence from the Melbourne Cricket Club , which managed the Melbourne Cricket Ground . VFL Park was planned to hold 155,000 spectators, which would have made it one of the largest stadiums in the world – although it would ultimately be built with a capacity of 78,000. Land for the stadium was purchased at Mulgrave, then farmland but predicted to be near the demographic centre of Melbourne's population. , Geelong was the stand out team at the beginning of the 1950s, winning the premiership in 1951 and then setting an enduring record of 23 consecutive wins starting in Round 12, 1952 and ending in Round 13, 1953. This streak included the 1952 premiership. Footscray became the first of the 1925 expansion teams to win the premiership in 1954. , Melbourne became a powerhouse during the 1950s and early 1960s under coach Norm Smith and star player Ron Barassi . The club contested seven consecutive grand finals from 1954 to 1960, winning five premierships, including three in a row from 1955 to 1957. , Television coverage began in 1957, with direct telecasts of the final quarter permitted. At first, several channels competed through broadcasting different games. However, when the VFL found that television was reducing crowds, it decided that no coverage was to be allowed for 1960. In 1961, replays (in Melbourne) were introduced although direct telecasts were rarely permitted in Melbourne (other States and Territories, however, enjoyed live telecasts every Saturday afternoon). , The VFL Premiership Trophy was first awarded in addition to a pennant flag in 1959; essentially the same trophy design has been in use since. , In the 1960s, television began to have a huge impact. Spectators hurried home from games to watch replays and many former players took up positions as commentators on pre-game preview programs and post-game review programs. There were also several attempts at variety programs featuring VFL players, who generally succeeded in demonstrating that their skills were limited to the football ground. , The VFL played the first of a series of exhibition matches in 1962 in an effort to lift the international profile of the league. , Hawthorn won its first premiership in 1961, beating Footscray. Melbourne extended its success from the 1950s by winning the premiership in 1964, but its success ended abruptly when Barassi was recruited by Carlton as captain-coach after the season, followed by Norm Smith being sacked during the 1965 season. Melbourne would not return to the finals for twenty-three years, and (as of 2014) has not yet won another premiership. , St Kilda, which had never won a VFL or VFA premiership in more than 93 years of competition, won its first and, to date, only premiership, in a famous Grand Final victory against Collingwood by one point. , With the number of players recruited from country leagues increasing, the wealthier clubs were gaining an advantage that metropolitan zoning and the Coulter law (salary cap) restricting player payments had prevented in the past. Country zoning was introduced in the late 1960s, and whilst it pushed Essendon and Geelong from the top of the ladder, it created severe inequality during the 1970s and 1980s. Between 1972 and 1987, only six of the league's twelve clubs – Carlton, Collingwood, Essendon, Hawthorn, North Melbourne and Richmond – played in Grand Finals; by comparison, nine different clubs had contested Grand Finals between 1961 and 1967. , The 1970 season saw the opening of VFL Park, with the inaugural match being played between Geelong and Fitzroy, on 18 April 1970. Construction work was carried out at the stadium as the 1970s progressed, culminating in the building of the now heritage listed Sir Kenneth Luke stand. The Queen of Australia , Elizabeth II was a guest at the game and officially opened the stadium to the public. The 1970 Grand Final between traditional rivals Carlton and Collingwood, arguably the league's most famous game, saw Carlton recover from a 44-point deficit at half-time to win the game by ten points, featured a famous spectacular mark by Alex Jesaulenko , and was witnessed by a record crowd of 121,696. , Carlton and Richmond won three premierships each between 1968–1974, facing each other in three Grand Finals. North Melbourne , after struggling for most of its time in the VFL, finally won its first premiership in 1975 , and contesting the Grand Final each year from 1974-1978, winning two ; three of those deciders were against fellow 1925 expansion team Hawthorn, who also won two premierships. Carlton won three premierships in four years from 1979–1982. , Among the notable rule changes made during the decade were: , The 1980s was a period of significant structural change in Australian football around the country. The VFL was the most popular and dominant of the state leagues around the country in terms of overall attendance, interest, and money, and began to look towards expanding its influence directly into other states. The VFL and its top clubs already had the buying power to recruit top players from interstate. As a result of this, rising cost pressures were driving some of Victoria's weaker clubs into dire financial situations. , But in spite of the increasing dominance of Victoria, the country's three top leagues – the VFL, South Australia's SANFL and Western Australia's WAFL , with teams from all three leagues competing in the Night Series , a competition run separate to the league competitions on weekday evenings. , South Melbourne became the first VFL club to relocate interstate, and the club moved to Sydney to become the Sydney Swans in 1982; under the private ownership of wealthy Dr Geoffrey Edelsten during the mid-1980s, Sydney became a successful team on-field. In 1986, the West Australian Football League and Queensland Australian Football League were awarded licences to join the VFL as expansion teams, leading to the establishment of the West Coast Eagles and Brisbane Bears , who both joined the league in 1987. These expansion team licences were awarded on payment of multi-million dollar fees which were not required of the existing VFL clubs. Interstate clubs dropped out of the Night Series , and by 1987 it consisted solely of VFL clubs; it was shifted to become the modern day pre-season competition in 1988. In 1989, financial troubles nearly forced Footscray and Fitzroy to merge, but a fundraising event from Footscray supporters stopped the proposed merger at the eleventh hour. , The 1980s first saw new regular timeslots for VFL matches. VFL matches had previously been played on Saturday afternoons, but Sydney began playing its home matches on Sunday afternoons, and North Melbourne pioneered playing matches on Friday night. These have since become regular timeslots for all teams. , In the late 1980s, the former zoning arrangements which had led to such inequality between the stronger and weaker clubs began to be phased out. The first National Draft was introduced in 1986, and a salary cap was introduced in 1987. Over the following decade, these changes helped to equalise the clubs, minimising the ability for the richer clubs to dominate the league. , In 1984, there was a revival of the International Rules representative series, which had first been played in the 1960s. The matches were played with a hybrid set of rules based on Australian rules football and Gaelic football . It also began to pave the way for Gaelic footballers to convert to Australian football; pioneered by Melbourne and known as the Irish experiment , Irish players Sean Wight and Jim Stynes began their successful VFL/AFL careers in the mid-1980s. Many Irish players have since played professional AFL football. , On-field, the 1980s were dominated by Hawthorn, Essendon and Carlton: Hawthorn contested seven consecutive Grand Finals for four premierships; Carlton contested four Grand Finals for three flags; and Essendon contested three consecutive Grand Finals, all against Hawthorn, winning two, and establishing a bitter rivalry. In the process, Carlton and Essendon both passed Collingwood in terms of number of premierships won; since 1982, Carlton has continuously been the team with most premierships won, holding the position jointly with Essendon for much of that time. The 1989 Grand Final between Hawthorn and Geelong is considered one of the finest Grand Finals, with many strong physical encounters, a joint Grand Final record nine goals by Geelong's Gary Ablett, Sr. , and Geelong coming back from a 36-point deficit at three quarter time to fall six points short of victory. , The league was officially renamed the Australian Football League in 1990 to reflect the new national perspective;  the VFA later took over the Victorian Football League name in 1996. Functionally, the AFL gave up control over its Victorian-based minor grades at the end of 1991 – clubs continued to field reserves teams in the independent Victorian State Football League , while an entirely new under-18s competition (the TAC Cup ) was established with new, zone-based clubs. Without minor grades, the McClelland Trophy was now awarded to the senior minor premiers. , Collingwood won the AFL Premiership in 1990, ending a 32-year premiership drought, which featured a string of near misses known as the Colliwobbles that had seen the club lose eight Grand Finals. , In 1990, the SANFL's most successful club, Port Adelaide , made a bid for an AFL licence. In response, the SANFL established a composite South Australian team called the Adelaide Crows , which was awarded the licence and joined the league in 1991 as the fourth interstate club. The same year saw the West Coast Eagles become the first interstate club reach the Grand Final, losing to Hawthorn; the Eagles would then win the premiership in 1992 and 1994. In 1994, the Fremantle Football Club was formed in Western Australia, and joined in the AFL in 1995, becoming the fifth interstate club. , In 1996, the VFL/AFL celebrated its centenary; the Australian Football Hall of Fame was established and the VFL/AFL Team of the Century was named. However, several Victorian clubs were in severe financial difficulties, most notably Fitzroy and Hawthorn. Hawthorn had proposed to merge with Melbourne to form the Melbourne Hawks , but the merger ultimately fell through and both teams continued as separate entities. For Fitzroy, however, the club was too weak to continue by itself; the club nearly merged with North Melbourne to form the Fitzroy-North Melbourne Kangaroos , but after the other clubs voted against it, the club merged with Brisbane to become the Brisbane Lions .  Fitzroy played its last match at the end of 1996.With the Brisbane-Fitzroy merger, Port Adelaide was awarded an AFL licence, and joined the league in 1997. The AFL rejected bids from Queensland club Southport Sharks and the Tasmanian government to enter teams. , Some of the rule changes of the decade included the introduction of a third field umpire in 1994, a blood rule in 1994, and the introduction of a third (1994) and fourth (1998) interchange player. The International Rules series against the Gaelic Athletic Association was revived again in 1998, and has become a semi-permanent fixture since. The finals series was expanded from five teams to six in 1991, and then to eight teams in 1994. , Through the 1990s, there was a significant trend of Melbourne-based teams abandoning the use of their small (20,000–30,000 capacity) suburban venues for home matches, in favour of the larger MCG and Waverley Park. The 1990s saw the last matches played at Windy Hill (Essendon), Moorabbin Oval (St Kilda), Western Oval (Footscray) and Victoria Park (Collingwood), and saw Princes Park abandoned by its long-term co-tenant Hawthorn. The transition to the use of only two venues in Melbourne was ultimately completed in 2005, when Carlton abandoned the use of Princes Park. , There was no dominant club in the latter part of the 1990s, although North Melbourne was the most successful, winning two premierships from three Grand Finals. Adelaide won two Grand Finals, and Carlton won one Grand Final from two appearances. , In 1999, the league sold Waverley Park stadium and used the funds in a joint venture to begin construction of a brand-new stadium situated at Melbourne's Docklands . Representative state football came to an end, with the last State of Origin match held in 1999. ,  , The AFL logo was again changed in 2000, with a new look intended to coincide with the new millennium. Rivals Collingwood and Carlton played a pre-season match known as the 'Millennium Match' on New Year's Eve 1999. The new Docklands Stadium hosted its first match in Round 1, 2000, between Essendon and Port Adelaide , with Essendon winning by 94 points;  it was the first AFL match to be played under a retractable roof. After Victorian State Football League ceased operation at the end of 1999, the Victorian-based AFL clubs established connections with the Victorian Football League (a rebranding of the former VFA), with clubs either fielding reserves teams in the VFL, or entering into affiliations with existing senior VFL clubs to serve as feeder teams . , The early 2000s were dominated by Essendon, Brisbane and Port Adelaide, who shared the five flags from 2000–2004. Essendon won three consecutive minor premierships between 1999 and 2001, but converted only the 2000 season into a premiership; Essendon's 2000 season set an enduring record, with a win-loss record of 24–1 across the home and away season and finals, the best ever recorded. Brisbane contested four consecutive Grand Finals, winning three of them in 2001–2003 and losing the other to Port Adelaide in 2004; the Power had won three consecutive minor premierships in 2002–2004, but could only capture the premiership in 2004 , doing so at the expense of the Lions, who were attempting to match Collingwood 's record of four premierships in a row set between 1927 and 1930.  The dominance of interstate clubs continued to six consecutive flags, with Sydney and West Coast facing each other in 2005 and 2006 Grand Finals for one flag each, with both matches decided by less than a goal. , The 2002 season saw the Carlton Football Club finish last, becoming the last of the twelve VFL clubs to win its first wooden spoon, before being heavily penalised for cheating the salary cap a few years earlier; the penalties impeded Carlton from rebuilding its playing list in the short term and saw them stay near the bottom of the ladder for the next six years. , A series of new rule changes were introduced for the 2006 season intended to speed up the game, allowing full-backs to kick in more quickly after a behind, and limiting the length of time that a player was allowed to hold the ball after a mark to eight seconds for a mark in general play, and 30 seconds for a set shot (known as the Lloyd rule).  , Several teams established a regular presence in other parts of Australasia during the 21st century, generally by playing between one and four home matches in the alternative location. Among the notable contracts include Hawthorn (Launceston), St Kilda (Launceston and Wellington),  North Melbourne (Gold Coast, Canberra and Hobart), Richmond (Cairns), Port Adelaide (Darwin) and the Western Bulldogs (Darwin and Cairns). , In the late 2000s, the AFL looked to establish a permanent presence on the Gold Coast , which was fast-developing as a major population centre. North Melbourne, who was in financial difficulty and had played a few home games on the Gold Coast in previous years, was offered significant subsidies to relocate to the Gold Coast, but the club declined. The AFL then began work to establish a club on the Gold Coast as a new expansion team; the Gold Coast Suns were established, and joined the AFL in 2011 as the 17th team. The Greater Western Sydney Giants , based in both Western Sydney and Canberra, were then established, and entered the league as the 18th team in 2012. , Early in 2008, a meeting held by the AFL discussed having two new teams enter the AFL competition.  In March 2008, the AFL won the support of the league's 16 club presidents to establish sides on the Gold Coast and in Western Sydney; both teams would enter the competition in 2011 and 2012 respectively. , The AFL has also considered a bid from the Tasmanian government for a licence for a Tasmanian team .  A third team based in Sydney has been suggested.  A third team based in Perth has been suggested.  On 25 April 2013 the Westpac Stadium in Wellington , New Zealand hosted the first ever Australian Football League game played for premiership points outside of Australia . The night game between St Kilda and Sydney was played in front of a crowd of 22,183 on Anzac Day to honour the Anzac bond between the two countries.   At the official pre-match function the Prime Minister of New Zealand John Key used the occasion to raise the prospect of a New Zealand-based AFL team, saying "Let's get real. We've got to get a New Zealand side in the AFL."  , In 2010, a licence was granted to the Greater Western Sydney Giants , a second Sydney-based team based at Homebush in Western Sydney. The team also plays some of its home games in Canberra , A.C.T. . Also in the 2010 season, the AFL experienced the third Grand Final draw in its history when St Kilda drew with Collingwood. The replay was staged 1 week later with Collingwood running out premiers. , In 2011 new club, the Gold Coast Suns entered the league  having been granted a licence in 2009. In the 2011 season Geelong returned to the Grand Final and defeated Collingwood. In 2012 the Greater Western Sydney Giants joined the league and played their first season finishing in last place. Sydney won their 5th premiership defeating Hawthorn, but Hawthorn would redeem themselves one year later by defeating Fremantle to win the 2013 title. This also marked Fremantle's first Grand Final since joining the competition in 1995. , The 2014 season marked Andrew Demetriou's last as CEO of the AFL. He announced his retirement from the position and stepped down in June 2014 being replaced by Gillon McLachlan. In 2014 Gillon McLachlan announced the AFL has an idea for a Tasmanian team to join the AFL, but it would not happen for at least 10 years. The 2014 season also saw Peta Searle become the first woman appointed as a development coach in the AFL when she joined St Kilda.  , , The AFL operates on a single table system, with no divisions, conferences nor promotion and relegation from other leagues. , The league was founded as the Victorian Football League (VFL) in 1897 , consisting of eight teams only based in the Australian state of Victoria . Over the next century, a series of expansions, a relocation, a merger and a club withdrawal saw the leagues teams expand to the 18 teams there are today. , The current 18 teams are based across 5 states of Australia. The majority (10) still remain in Victoria, while the states of New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia have two each. In 1990 the national nature of the competition resulted in the name change to the Australian Football League. Tasmania , Australian Capital Territory , and Northern Territory are the only states/mainland territories not to have AFL clubs. , Since the Australian Football League commenced in 1897 as the Victorian Football League, only one club has left the competition, the Melbourne University Football Club ; it last competed in 1914, and withdrew because, as a strictly amateur club, it became unable to remain competitive in a time when player payments were becoming common;   the club still competes to this day in the Victorian Amateur Football Association . Two other clubs, the Fitzroy Football Club (Fitzroy Lions) and the Brisbane Bears , merged in 1996 to form the Brisbane Lions . , Below are the venues to be used during the 2015 AFL season . , Canberra , ACT , Throughout the history of the VFL/AFL, there have been a total of 42 different grounds used, with 14 used during the 2014 season.  The largest capacity ground in use is the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), which has a capacity of over 100,000 people, and hosts the Grand Final each year.  The MCG is shared by five teams as a home ground, whilst the other grounds used as home venues by multiple teams are Docklands Stadium in Melbourne (five teams), Stadium Australia in Sydney (two teams), Adelaide Oval in Adelaide (two teams), and Subiaco Oval in Perth (two teams). , Prior to the expansion of the competition, most grounds were located in suburban Melbourne, with Princes Park , Victoria Park , the Junction Oval , Waverley Park , and the Lake Oval each having hosted over 700 games.  However, since the introduction of a national competition, each state and territory of Australia has hosted AFL games.  , On 25 April 2013 ( Anzac Day ), a match took place between St Kilda and Sydney at Westpac Stadium in Wellington , New Zealand, being the first AFL match played outside Australia for official premiership points.  At the end of 2013 a new five-year deal was announced that will see St Kilda play a match on Anzac Day at the stadium every year until 2018.  , AFL players are drawn from a number of sources; however, most players enter the league through the AFL draft , held at the end of each season. A small number of players have converted from other sports, or been recruited internationally. Prior to the nationalisation of the competition, a zoning system was in place. At the end of the season, the best 22 players and coach from across the competition are selected in the All-Australian team . , The AFL has tight controls over the player lists of each club. Currently, apart from the recently added expansion clubs who have some additional players, each team can have a senior list of 38 to 40 players plus 4 to 6 rookie players , to a total of 44 players  (following a reduction by two of the number of rookies in 2012) and up to three development rookies (international, alternate talent or New South Wales scholarship players).  Changes to playing lists are permitted only in the off-season: clubs can trade players during a " trade period " which follows each season and recruit new players through the three AFL drafts , the national draft, the pre-season draft and the rookie draft, which take place after the trade period. A mid-year draft was conducted between 1990 and 1993.  The national draft is the primary method of recruiting new players and has been used since 1986. The draft order is based on reverse-finishing position from the previous year, but selections can be traded. Free agency player movements have only been permitted since the 2012/13 offseason,  having been rejected by the AFL commission previously.  , A salary cap (known as the Total Player Payments or TPP) is also in place as part of the league's equalisation policy; this is A$9,130,000 for the 2013 season with a salary floor of $8,673,500 except for the Gold Coast , whose salary cap will be A$9,630,000 with a salary floor of $9,171,500, and Greater Western Sydney , whose salary cap is $9,987,000 with a floor of $9,530,500. As part of the AFL's enhanced equalisation policies, in 2014 the league announced an increase of the TPP for the 2015 and 2016 seasons. TPP increases an additional $150,000 per club in 2015 above previously contracted amounts, increasing from $9.92m to $10.07m in 2015 and $10.22m to $10.37m in 2016.  , The salary cap was set at A$1.25 million for 1987–1989 as per VFL agreement, with the salary floor set at 90% of the cap or $1.125 million; the salary floor was increased to 92.5% of the cap in 2001, and 95% of the cap for 2013 due to increased revenues. Both the salary cap and salary floor has increased substantially since the competition was rebranded as the AFL in 1990. , Salaries of draft selections are fixed for two years. Salaries for senior players are not normally released to the public, though the average AFL player salary at the conclusion of the 2012 season was $251,559  and the top few players can expect to earn up to and above $1,000,000 a year.  Upon successfully trading to the Sydney Swans in 2013, marquee player Lance Franklin signed a 9-year contract with the club, reportedly worth over $10 million and resulting in subsequent payments of $1.8 million annually in consecutive seasons.  The Total Player Earnings (TPE) – or total amount of revenue spent on reimbursement of AFL listed players – at the conclusion of the 2012 season was $173.7 million, up by 13 per cent from $153.7 million in 2011.  , The breaches of the salary cap and salary floor regulations outlined by the AFL are: exceeding the TPP; falling below the salary floor; not informing the AFL of payments; late or incorrect lodgement or loss of documents; or engaging in draft tampering. Penalties include fines of up to triple the amount involved ($10,000 for each document late or incorrect lodged or lost), forfeiture of draft picks and/or deduction of premiership points. The most significant breach of the salary cap was that of the Carlton Football Club in the early 2000s . , There were 801 players on AFL club senior, veteran, rookie and international lists in 2011, including players from every state and mainland territory of Australia.  , As of 2014, there are 68 players of Indigenous Australian descent on AFL club lists, comprising approximately 9% of the overall playing population.  , There were 12 players recruited from outside of Australia on AFL lists in 2011, including 10 from Ireland, all converts from Gaelic football drafted as part of the Irish Experiment . The other two players are Seamus McNamara ( Collingwood ) and Mike Pyke ( Sydney ), recruited from the United States and Canada respectively. , There were also another five overseas-born players who emigrated to Australia at an early age on AFL lists.  , An international rookie list and international scholarship list were introduced in 2006. The international rookie list includes up to two players between the ages of 15 and 23 who are not Australian citizens. These players may remain on this list for up to three years before they must be transferred to the senior or rookie list. For the first year, payments made to international-rookie-listed players fall outside the salary cap. The international scholarship list gives AFL clubs the option of recruiting up to eight players from outside Australia (other than Ireland). Irish players are required to either be placed on clubs' senior or rookie lists .  At the beginning of 2011 there were 14 international scholarship players.  , Of the 121 multicultural players, more than half have one parent from Anglophone countries, mainly the United Kingdom , Ireland and New Zealand .  , From 1988 until 2013, the AFL ran a pre-season competition that finished prior to the commencement of the premiership season, which served as both warm-up matches for the season and as a stand-alone competition. It was mostly contested as a four-week knock out tournament , but the format changed after the expansion of the league beyond sixteen clubs in 2011. The competition has frequently been used to trial rule changes. In 2014, the competition format was abandoned, and practice matches are now played under the sponsored name NAB Challenge . , The AFL home-and-away season at present lasts for 23 rounds, starting in late March and ending in early September. As of the 2013 AFL season , each team plays 22 matches, with one bye. Teams receive four premiership points for a win and two premiership points for a draw. Ladder finishing positions are based on the number of premiership points won, and "percentage" (calculated as the ratio of points scored to points conceded throughout the season) is used as a tie-breaker when teams finish with equal premiership points. At the end of the home-and-away season, the McClelland Trophy is awarded to the minor premiers . , Some rounds of the season are named as themed rounds, such as Rivalry Round (in which traditional rivals are matched up against each other), Women's Round and Heritage Round (where teams play in old style guernseys ). Some matches are also themed for special events. For example, each year Collingwood play Essendon in the annual ANZAC Day match at the MCG and the game will typically sell out regardless of the positions of the two teams on the ladder due to their strong rivalry and huge followings. Another annual match is the Queen's Birthday game between Melbourne and Collingwood. As of 2006, Richmond and Essendon play in the Dreamtime at the 'G match. There are separate trophies for the matches between several clubs and former rivalries such as the Lake Trophy between St Kilda and the Sydney Swans. , The top eight teams at the end of the AFL Premiership season compete in a four-week finals series throughout September, culminating in a grand final to determine the premiers. The grand final is traditionally played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on the afternoon of the last Saturday in September. , The winning team receives a silver premiership cup and a navy blue premiership flag – a new one of each is manufactured each year. The flag has been presented since the league began and is traditionally unfurled at the team's first home game of the following season. The trophy was first introduced in 1959 and is manufactured annually by Cash's International at their metalworks in Frankston, Victoria .  Additionally, each player in the grand final-winning team receives a premiership medallion. , The following major individual awards and accolades are presented each season: , Other independent best and fairest awards are presented by different football and media organisations. , To celebrate the 100th season of the AFL, the "AFL Team of the Century" was named in 1996. , There is currently no official state representation for AFL players despite the concept being well supported among fans and calls to re-introduce a State of Origin series.   , VFL players first represented the Victoria representative team in 1897 regardless of their state of origin. , Being the dominant league drawing many of the country's best players, the Victoria Australian rules football team (nicknamed the "Big V" and composed mostly of VFL players) dominated interstate matches until the introduction of State of Origin selection criteria by the Australian Football Council in 1977, after which Victoria's results with the other main Australian football states became more even. , The AFL Commission assumed control of interstate football in 1993 and co-ordinated an annual State of Origin series typically held during a mid-season bye round. However after the 1999 series, the AFL declared the concept of interstate football "on hold" citing club's unwillingness to release star players and a lack of public interest and shifted its focus of representative football to the International Rules Series where it draws a greater television revenue. , The last time AFL players played formal interstate football was in the 1999 State of Origin Series when Victoria inflicted a massive defeat on South Australia in wet conditions in front of a crowd of 26,063. Just 10 years earlier, the same match with a plethora of star players attracted a crowd of 91,960. , A once-off representative match, known as the AFL Hall of Fame Tribute Match was played in 2008 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the sport. The match was played between a team of players of Victorian origin and a team of players of interstate origin (the " Dream Team ") , Some past AFL players participate and help promote the E. J. Whitten Legends Game , however this event is not affiliated with or promoted by the AFL. , The International Rules Series is an annual competition played twice every three years between AFL listed players from Australia and Gaelic footballers from Ireland . The series is organised under the auspices of the AFL and the Gaelic Athletic Association . The game itself is a hybrid sport , consisting of rules from both Australian football and Gaelic football. The series provides the only outlet for AFL players to represent their nation. , The AFL Commission is responsible for the administration of the AFL. It was established in December 1985, and then granted almost unilateral administrative control over the league in 1993,  after the club parochialism and self-interest which came with the traditional club delegate based administrative structure threatened to undermine the competition. , The Commission's chairman is Mike Fitzpatrick , a former Subiaco and Carlton player, and the Chief Executive is Gillon McLachlan , who officially took over from Andrew Demetriou on the 4th June, 2014. , The Commission's composition remains almost exclusively Victorian based with one exception, Bob Hammond from South Australia. , In addition to administering the national competition, the AFL is heavily involved in promoting and developing the sport in Australia. It provides funds for local leagues and in conjunction with local clubs, administers the Auskick program for young boys and girls. , The AFL also plays a leading role in developing the game outside Australia, with projects to develop the game at junior level in other countries (e.g. South Africa) and by supporting affiliated competitions around the world (See Australian football around the world ). , The players of the AFL are represented by the AFL Players Association . , The AFL is the best-attended sporting league in Australia ,  and averaged 33,461 people per game over the 2013 season, giving AFL the 4th highest average attendance figures of any professional sport in the world.  According to market research, the AFL is the second-most-watched sporting event in Australia, behind cricket .  Currently, broadcast rights for the AFL are shared between the Seven Network ( free-to-air ), Foxtel and Austar ( pay TV ), and Telstra (internet). At the end of the 2013 season, a record 756,717 people were members of an AFL club.  , The following are the most recent season attendances: , AFL matches are currently broadcast in Australia by the free-to-air Seven Network , subscription television provider Foxtel , and digital content provider Telstra . The 5-year deal, announced in April 2011, covers the 2012-2016 (inclusive) seasons. Telstra won the rights to broadcast one live match per week via IP Television and on its Telstra Mobile service. The deal was confirmed when the Seven Network, Foxtel and Telstra agreed to pay A$1.253 billion to the Australian Football League to broadcast every match of every round and all of the Finals Series across their platforms.  As part of the agreement, Austar broadcasts Foxtel`s AFL coverage in the regional areas of Australia that are not part of Foxtel`s service area. Regional free-to-air broadcasters associated with the Seven Network – Prime7 , GWN7 , Seven Queensland , Southern Cross Television and WIN Television – all show Seven's coverage in their respective areas. , The Seven Network broadcasts four games from every round of the regular premiership season, as well as the AFL Finals Series and the AFL Grand Final . Foxtel broadcasts every match from every round, including simulcasts of all Seven Network games except for the Grand Final (which Seven shows exclusively live). Coverage is also available via Foxtel`s IP television service (Foxtel on T-Box). , The 1957 VFL season was the first broadcast after the commencement of television in Australia (introduced in 1956 to coincide with the Melbourne Olympic Games). During the late 1950s and 1960s, all Melbourne stations ( ABV2 , HSV7 , GTV9 and, after it commenced in 1965, ATV0/ATV10 ) broadcast some games. However, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the VFL was concerned that direct telecasts may affect attendances and stations were only permitted to telecast a delayed replay of the last quarter of games. In the 1980s, the Seven Network was given exclusive rights to VFL/AFL games. The only year Seven did not telecast games was 1987, when the rights were bought by Broadcom, which on-sold the rights to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). The exclusive rights were won back by Seven in 1988. , With the launch of subscription television in Australia, AFL match coverage commenced on cable television. Optus Vision bid for and won exclusive pay TV rights from 1996–2001, screening coverage on its own 24-hour AFL channel, branded Sports AFL in Brisbane Sydney and Melbourne (where available). The Sports AFL channel was later closed due to financial issues and relaunched in March 1999 as C7 Sport by the Seven Network with AFL match coverage also transferred to the new channel. C7 Sport became available in regional areas not in the Foxtel or Optus Vision licence area via Austar soon after the re-launch. The AFL coverage was not available through Foxtel at this time as the Seven Network and Foxtel disagreed on the cost of carrying the C7 channel. These issues regarding C7 and AFL broadcsting rights evolved into a court case between not just the Seven Network and News Limited , but Seven against the owners of the Nine Network and Network Ten in the years that followed. , In late 2000, the Seven Network's main rivals, the Kerry Packer led Nine Network , Network Ten and pay-TV's Foxtel set up a consortium which bid $500 million for the right to broadcast the 2002 – 2006 seasons inclusive. Seven had purchased a guaranteed right to make the last bid in 1995,  but decided not to outbid their rivals.  The games were split between the networks, with Nine screening Friday Night Football and two matches on Sunday, Ten screened a Saturday afternoon and a Saturday night match, with the remaining four matches shown on Foxtel. Foxtel set up its own version of a dedicated AFL-only channel, the Fox Footy Channel , which showed every game on replay during the week as well as many news, talkback and general interest shows related to Australian rules football.  , When the rights were offered again in January 2006 for the 2007 to 2011 seasons, Seven formed an alliance with Ten and used its guaranteed last bid rights to match Nine's offer of $780 million to win back the broadcast rights in what was the biggest sport telecasting deal in Australian history at the time. After lengthy negotiations, Foxtel agreed to be a broadcast partner and now showed four live matches each week, although no longer on a dedicated AFL channel.  Seven took back the Friday night match and only one game on Sunday, while Ten retained showing two matches on Saturdays. Foxtel showed two games on Saturday and two on Sunday, including a late afternoon or twilight game.  , Historically AFL broadcasts in other countries have varied. , In the 1980s, VFL matches were shown in the United States on ESPN for some time. In the early 1990s, Prime Network , an American regional sports network unrelated to the Australian regional television network , aired Seven's weekly highlight show as well as the Grand Final. Some other English speaking countries have shown the game, however it has been since 2008 that channels in other countries began televising matches. From 1998 to 2006 games were broadcast in the United States by the Fox Sports World network.  , In 2007, after the record domestic television rights deal, the AFL secured an additional bonus: greater international television rights and increase exposure to overseas markets, including a five-year deal with Setanta Sports and new deals with other overseas pay-TV networks. The deal ended early in 2009 when Setanta stopped broadcasting into Great Britain. ESPN again took up the contract.  , The following countries are ranked by the approximate extent of their current television coverage (and whether it is free to air): , The AFL has stated that it wishes to showcase the footballing code to other countries such as India , China and South Africa so as to create a global following thus creating more exposure for its sponsors in the increasing Asian and African markets.  On 17 October 2010, AFL clubs Melbourne Demons and Brisbane Lions played an exhibition game in front of almost 10,000 people at the Riverside Sports Center in Shanghai . [ citation needed ] This was the first professional AFL game to be played in China . , The AFL has garnered increased interest in Ireland due to the introduction of the International Rules series played between an AFL picked All Australian Team and Ireland. [ citation needed ] This paved the way for young Irish footballers to be rostered to AFL teams mainly due to the fact that salaries in the AFL are much larger than that of Gaelic Football although most Irish players fail to make the grade into 1st team football.  This also paved the way for extended news coverage and increased broadcasting in the UK and Ireland . [ citation needed ] , The first broadcast of a VFL game was by 3AR in 1923, the year that broadcasting officially commenced in Australia. The first commentator was Wallace (Jumbo) Shallard , a former Geelong player who went on to have a long and respected career in print and broadcast media. The VFL/AFL has been broadcast every year since then by the ABC and (since 1927) by various commercial stations. The saturation period was the early 1960s when seven of the eight extant radio stations ( 3AR , 3UZ , 3DB , 3KZ , 3AW , 3XY and 3AK ) broadcast VFL games each week, as well as broadcasts of Geelong games by local station 3GL . (At this time, the only alternative that radio listeners had to listening to the football on a Saturday afternoon were the classical music and fine arts programs that were broadcast by 3LO ). , Currently, the official radio broadcast partners of the AFL are: , The official internet/mobile broadcast partner of the AFL is Bigpond , part of Telstra . The AFL also provides exclusive broadband content including streaming video for international fans via its website. Bigpond also hosts the official websites of all the 17 AFL clubs excluding Essendon. , The service is also provided to international subscribers. Delayed video is available 12 hours or more after the game. , However, the website is frequently derided by users for its convoluted information architecture and bloated presentation.   , Since 2012, Telstra has broadcast live matches over its Next G mobile network for a pay-per-view or season fee.  , The following are the official naming sponsors of the VFL/AFL competition: , ¹ Note: In 2001 CUB and Coca-Cola were joint sponsors , The official print broadcast partner of the AFL is News Limited . The AFL Record is a match-day magazine published by the AFL and is read by around 225,000 people each week. , The AFL sells memberships that entitle subscribers to reserve seats for matches at Docklands Stadium and Melbourne Cricket Ground in Melbourne. AFL members also receive priority access to finals. Two levels of memberships are now offered, silver and full, with the main difference being that only full members have guaranteed access to Preliminary and Grand Final matches.  , The AFL runs a chain of stores that sell merchandise from all clubs. Merchandise is also available from other retailers. , A modern museum called the Hall of Fame and Sensation opened in Melbourne in 2003 to celebrate the culture of the AFL and to provide a venue for the Australian Football Hall of Fame . The museum, a licensed off-shoot of the AFL, was originally touted for the MCG, but the Hall of Fame failed to get support from the Melbourne Cricket Club. The new QV shopping centre on Swanston Street was then chosen as the location. However, controversy followed the appointment of an administrator as the museum began running at a loss. Many blamed high entry prices, which were subsequently reduced, and the museum remains open to the public. In early 2006 the name was changed to AFL World. It features various honour boards and memorabilia as well as a range of innovative interactive displays designed to immerse visitors in the experience of elite Aussie Rules. It was closed down in 2008. , The following is a list of all the video games from the AFL video game series: , The AFL is the subject of footy tipping and betting competitions around Australia run by individuals, syndicates, workplaces and professional bookmakers . In recent years national website based tipping competitions have started to replace the traditional, but more labour-intensive, office or pub run competitions. , Fantasy football competitions based on actual player statistics (number of kicks, marks, goals etc.) are also very popular on websites and in newspapers. , Lists: , Statistics and Results , Major AFL news Sites  The Adelaide Football Club , nicknamed "The Crows", is a professional Australian rules football club that competes in the Australian Football League (AFL).  The club is based in Adelaide , South Australia , playing its home matches at Adelaide Oval .  The club has its training and administration base at Football Park in West Lakes , where it previously played home matches between 1991 and 2013. The club song is "The Pride of South Australia", to the tune of the Marines' Hymn .  , The Crows were formed in 1990 as a composite team owned by the SANFL and played their first season in 1991 .   They won both the 1997 and 1998 Grand Finals and have appeared in twelve finals series in their 24-year history. As a tribute to the team's success over the years, the Crows have been informally nicknamed "the team for all South Australians ".  , The club is currently captained by Taylor Walker and coached by Phil Walsh , both new appointments for the 2015 season.   , , , Throughout the 1980s, the Victorian Football League (VFL) began to expand outside of Victoria, firstly by the relocation of a team into New South Wales ( Sydney Swans ) in 1982, and then the expansion into Western Australia ( West Coast Eagles ) and Queensland ( Brisbane Bears ) in 1987. However, the SANFL was against a South Australian team joining the VFL under the financial terms offered throughout the 1980s. To circumvent this, the VFL negotiated directly with both the Port Adelaide and Norwood Football Clubs during the late 1980s, but did not come to an agreement.  , After the VFL was renamed the AFL for the 1990 season, the SANFL clubs unanimously resolved, in May 1990, that a team would not be entered into the AFL until season 1993.  The AFL refused to accept this, and revised negotiations with individual clubs. Two months later, the Port Adelaide Football Club reached heads of agreement with the AFL to enter a team into its competition in season 1991. The other nine SANFL clubs reacted strongly and entered into litigation in an endeavour to halt Port's bid. , As the terms offered were more favourable than previously offered, talks were resumed. On 19 September 1990, the AFL approved the bid for a new South Australian club to enter to the league, rather than a single existing SANFL club.  2 , The Adelaide Crows played their first season in the AFL in 1991. Their inaugural coach was Graham Cornes  and their first captain was Chris McDermott .  , Adelaide's first AFL game was against Hawthorn on Friday 22 March at their then home ground, Football Park (later renamed AAMI Stadium). The Crows defeated the eventual premiers by a hefty 86-point margin, winning 24.11 (155) to 9.15 (69).  The Crows went on to finish in ninth place out of 15 teams on the AFL ladder, with 10 wins and 12 losses and a percentage of 89.44.  , Mark Mickan won the club's first Club Champion award (later named the Malcolm Blight Medal) for the club's best and fairest player throughout the season, with Tony McGuinness finishing runner-up.  Rod Jameson was the club's leading goalkicker with 49,  while Nigel Smart was named in the AFL All-Australian team .  , The Crows again finished in ninth place in 1992, with an 11-11 win-loss record and a percentage of 101.36.  , Chris McDermott won the Club Champion award from Tony McGuinness ,  while Scott Hodges led the club's goalscoring with 48 goals,  including a haul of 11 against Geelong in round 23.  McDermott, McGuinness and defender Ben Hart were all named in the 1992 All-Australian team.  , During the post-season trading period, Adelaide traded in future dual premiership player Matthew Robran from Hawthorn for pick 11 in the national draft , as well as receiving Sydney 's Stuart Wigney for pick 71.  , Adelaide finished fifth on the ladder after the home-and-away season in 1993, with 12 wins and 8 losses and a percentage of 117.83,  including a home record of 9 wins out of 10 at Football Park .  The Crows had to defeat Collingwood at home in the last match of the season to make the top six and thus qualify, and despite conceding six goals to one in the first quarter they did so by 24 points, 19.21 (135) to 17.9 (111).  , Under the McIntyre final six system in use, Adelaide travelled to play against fourth-placed Hawthorn at the MCG the next week, in the First Elimination Final. With Nigel Smart kicking four goals, Adelaide won 16.14 (110) to 13.17 (95).  Because sixth-placed West Coast had defeated third-placed North Melbourne , Adelaide progressed to the Second Semi Final against Carlton at Waverley Park , with a double-chance ensuring they would not be knocked out of the finals by a loss. The Crows lost to Carlton by 18 points, 13.8 (86) to 8.20 (68),  and thus had to play Essendon in the Preliminary Final, with the winner to play Carlton in the Grand Final. Whilst technically a Crows home game, the match was played at the MCG due to an agreement with the Melbourne Cricket Club that a match had to be played at the MCG during every week of the finals. Against Essendon, the Crows led by 42 points at half-time before collapsing to lose by 11: 17.9 (111) to 14.16 (100).  Adelaide player Mark Bickley later suggested that the players' poor performance during the second half may have been caused by the team's lack of concentration and resolve during the coach's half time address.  The loss ended the Crows' season, while Essendon then went on to defeat Carlton a week later and thus win the Premiership. , Tony McGuinness won the Club Champion award from Mark Bickley ,  while full-forward Tony Modra kicked a club record 129 goals for the season, including finals, to be the club's leading goalkicker.  Modra also was awarded the AFL Mark of the Year for his spectacular mark in round 8 against North Melbourne at Football Park. [ citation needed ] McGuinness, Modra, Greg Anderson , Ben Hart and Nigel Smart were all named in the All-Australian team for 1993.  The AFL Rising Star award was also first awarded in 1993, with Mark Ricciuto being nominated for his 28-disposal performance against Richmond in round 16.  , After the 1993 season, Adelaide traded in Hawthorn's Tony Hall and Collingwood's Brett Chalmers , in exchange for draft picks 17 and 34, respectively.  , Adelaide started the 1994 season by making the final of the pre-season knockout competition . In the competition, then known as the Foster's Cup , they played Essendon in the final and lost, 15.12 (102) to 9.14 (68).  , In 1994, Adelaide missed the finals for the third year out of four in the competition, finishing in 11th place with 9 wins and a draw from their 22 matches, and a percentage of 86.89.  Adelaide's draw against St Kilda at Waverley Park in round 14 remains their only draw in the AFL to date.  , Shaun Rehn was the club's Club Champion in 1994 with Tony McGuinness finishing runner-up.  Tony Modra kicked 70 goals to finish as the club's leading goalscorer,  while Rehn and Mark Ricciuto were both All-Australians,  and Matthew Kluzek and Sean Wellman achieved Rising Star nominations.  Following the season, coach Graham Cornes was sacked and replaced by Robert Shaw ,  while Tony McGuinness replaced Chris McDermott as captain.  , During the off-season, Adelaide secured future champion Andrew McLeod in a trade with new club Fremantle , in exchange for Chris Groom . They also traded for Collingwood 's Jason McCartney for draft picks 9 and 53, and West Coast 's Matthew Connell for pick 44.  The Crows also recruited future premiership players Peter Vardy (pick 7) and Tyson Edwards (pick 21) in the 1995 pre-season draft .  , In 1995, Adelaide again made the final of the pre-season competition, by this stage known as the Ansett Cup . They defeated Geelong , West Coast and Sydney before losing to North Melbourne in the final, 14.9 (93) to 8.15 (63).  , For the second successive season, Adelaide finished in 11th place on the AFL ladder, with a win-loss record of 9-13 and percentage of 80.08.  Matthew Connell won the Club Champion award from Andrew Jarman ,  while Tony Modra again led the Crows' goalscoring with 42 goals.  No Crows were selected in the 1995 All-Australian team.  Martin McKinnon and Andrew McLeod were both nominated for the Rising Star award.  , In the post-season trading period, the Crows secured Hawthorn premiership player Darren Jarman , brother of Andrew Jarman , in a complicated deal that saw them give up national draft pick 25 to Hawthorn and Sean Wellman to Essendon .   Adelaide also traded in Kym Koster ( Footscray ) for pick 9, Troy Bond ( Carlton ) for pick 63 and Peter Caven (Sydney) for Paul Rouvray ,  and drafted Kane Johnson (pick 27, national draft), Shane Ellen (pick 8, pre-season draft) and Simon Goodwin (pick 18, pre-season draft);  all would become premiership players for the club. , Adelaide started the 1996 season in good form, winning their first four matches and six of their first eight. However, they won just two more matches for the season: home matches against the Brisbane Bears and Fitzroy . They finished the season in 12th position, with 8 wins, 14 losses and a percentage of 95.96.  7 of these wins were at home; away from home they defeated only last-placed Fitzroy, in round 2.  , The Club Champion for 1996 was awarded to Matthew Liptak from Nigel Smart ,  while Darren Jarman was Adelaide's sole All-Australian representative.  No Crows were nominated for the 1996 Rising Star award.  For the fourth season in a row, Tony Modra topped Adelaide's goalkicking with 75.  Ben Hart was awarded the AFL Mark of the Year for his mark against St Kilda in Round 8. [ citation needed ] , Coach Robert Shaw was replaced at the end of the season by former Woodville and North Melbourne player Malcolm Blight .  Blight made an immediate impact upon arriving at the club, delisting captain Tony McGuinness and fan favourite Andrew Jarman in addition to retiring former captain Chris McDermott . [ citation needed ] Mark Bickley was appointed McGuinness' replacement as captain.  , During the off-season, Adelaide traded in Brett James ( Collingwood ) for Jonathon Ross ; Trent Ormond-Allen and Clay Sampson ( Melbourne ) for pick 83 and Nick Pesch ; Tim Cook , Aaron Keating and Nick Laidlaw ( Port Adelaide ) for Scott Hodges and David Brown ; and Barry Standfield ( Footscray ) for picks 32 and 47.  Notable draftees included future premiership players Andrew Eccles (pick 60, national draft), Chad Rintoul (pick 69, national draft) and Ben Marsh (pick 5, rookie draft).  , 1997 marked the entry of a second South Australian club, Port Adelaide . The lingering resentment from the circumstances surrounding Adelaide's entry to the competition created a healthy rivalry between the teams [ citation needed ] , and clashes between them became known as Showdowns . , Adelaide started the 1997 season by defeating the newly formed Brisbane Lions (created by the merging of the Brisbane Bears and Fitzroy ) but then lost three consecutive games, including an 11-point loss to Port Adelaide in the first Showdown in Round 4, 11.17 (83) to 11.6 (72). However, Adelaide rebounded to win 11 of their next 15 matches, including five in a row between rounds 7 and 11. After defeating Port Adelaide by 7 points in round 19, Adelaide were top of the ladder with three matches to play; however, they won just one of those three games and qualified for the finals in fourth place with a 13-9 record. , At the time the McIntyre Final Eight System was in use, meaning the Crows hosted fifth-placed West Coast in the First Elimination Final. In the first final ever to be played at Football Park , the Crows won 14.15 (99) to 9.12 (66). The next week, Adelaide hosted Geelong , who had come second but lost the previous week to North Melbourne , in the Second Semi Final, winning narrowly: 11.10 (76) to 9.14 (68). This set up an away Preliminary Final against the Western Bulldogs at the MCG . Despite losing Coleman Medallist Tony Modra , who had kicked 84 goals for the season, to an ACL injury in the first quarter and trailing by 31 points at half time, the Crows kicked four unanswered goals in the last quarter to record a two-point victory, 12.21 (93) to 13.13 (91), with Darren Jarman kicking a goal to put Adelaide in front with less than two minutes remaining. This allowed the Crows to qualify for their first AFL Grand Final, to be played against St Kilda at the MCG a week later. , St Kilda, chasing their second Premiership in VFL/AFL history, were warm favourites to win the Grand Final , having come first in the minor round and won both of their finals by margins of 46 and 31 points, against an Adelaide side without Tony Modra, Mark Ricciuto and goalsneak Peter Vardy due to injury. [ citation needed ] However, the Crows again overcame a half-time deficit, kicking 14 second-half goals to win by 31 points, 19.11 (125) to 13.16 (94). Darren Jarman kicked six goals, five of which came in the last quarter, whilst utility Shane Ellen kicked a career-best five and Troy Bond kicked four. Andrew McLeod , who gathered 31 possessions across half-back and in the midfield, won the Norm Smith Medal for the best player on-field in the Grand Final. , Andrew McLeod was the Crows' Club Champion in 1997, while Darren Jarman was runner-up. In addition to winning the Coleman Medal and being the club's leading goalkicker for the fifth straight season, Tony Modra was also awarded the AFL Mark of the Year for the second time, for his mark on the goal line over Mick Martyn against North Melbourne at Football Park in Round 12. Modra was also named at full-forward in the All-Australian team, while Mark Ricciuto was named on the interchange bench. Kane Johnson and Peter Vardy both achieved Rising Star nominations. , In the post-season trading period Adelaide received Nathan Bassett from Melbourne for Matthew Collins and Brent Williams , Mark Stevens from North Melbourne for Jason McCartney and Ian Downsborough from Port Adelaide for Brett Chalmers . The Crows drafted Lance Picioane with their first national draft pick at 17; he would play only 4 AFL games for the Crows and 77 in total. Other notable draftees included future premiership player James Thiessen at pick 33 and Ian Perrie at pick 49. Ben Marsh was also re-drafted as a rookie at pick 16. , For the second successive season, the Crows started slowly in 1998, winning just three of their first eight matches. From there they improved their win-loss record to 13-9, the same as the previous year. They did not seal their place in the top eight until the final round, when they defeated West Coast at Subiaco Oval by 25 points to clinch fifth place. Adelaide struggled throughout the season to win close matches; seven of their nine losses were by 13 points or less, compared to only three wins by corresponding margins. , The Crows travelled to face Melbourne at the MCG in the First Qualifying Final and were defeated easily, 17.13 (115) to 9.13 (67). However, as the highest-placed loser under the McIntyre Final Eight System they received a reprieve, and travelled to the SCG to play Sydney . With Peter Vardy kicking six goals, Adelaide won 14.10 (94) to 10.7 (67). This led them, for the second year in a row, to play the Western Bulldogs in a Preliminary Final at the MCG. In contrast to the thriller that took place the previous year, however, the Crows defeated the Bulldogs soundly, 24.17 (161) to 13.15 (93). Matthew Robran kicked six goals and Andrew McLeod , opposed to renowned tagger Tony Liberatore , booted seven. , Like the previous year, Adelaide went into the Grand Final as underdogs, playing against North Melbourne , who had won the Premiership in 1996 and had won eleven consecutive matches leading up to the Grand Final. North Melbourne led by 24 points at half-time, 6.15 (51) to 4.3 (27), with only their inaccurate goalkicking keeping Adelaide in the contest. However, as they had in the previous year, Adelaide dominated the second half to win by 35 points, 15.15 (105) to 8.22 (70). Darren Jarman kicked five goals, while Andrew McLeod won his second successive Norm Smith Medal, an unprecedented feat. , Mark Ricciuto won the Crows' Club Champion award in 1998, while Nigel Smart was runner-up. Ricciuto, Smart, Andrew McLeod and Shaun Rehn were all named in the All-Australian side, while Andrew Eccles was nominated for the AFL Rising Star award. Darren Jarman was Adelaide's leading goalkicker with 45. At the end of the season, Adelaide traded star forward Tony Modra to Fremantle , as well as Chad Rintoul to West Coast , for draft picks. In the national draft , Adelaide drafted future 100-game players Brett Burton (pick 16), Tyson Stenglein (pick 29) and Ken McGregor (pick 75). , The Crows made a good start to their premiership defence in 1999 with four wins in the first six rounds, before struggling for the rest of the season, winning only four more games. They eventually finished 13th with an 8-14 win-loss record, their lowest ever finish at the time, and the lowest finish by a reigning premier in VFL/AFL history [ citation needed ] . , Malcolm Blight resigned as coach at the end of the season, to be replaced by Gary Ayres , while popular defender (and inaugural leading goalkicker) Rod Jameson also played his final game in Adelaide's round 22 loss to the Kangaroos (newly renamed from North Melbourne). The Crows' Club Champion award, renamed the Malcolm Blight Medal in Blight's honour, was won by Ben Hart from Andrew McLeod . Hart was also Adelaide's only All-Australian representative. David Gallagher and Brett Burton both received AFL Rising Star nominations, while Darren Jarman led Adelaide's goalkicking for the second consecutive year with 58 goals. , In the off-season, Adelaide traded for Brisbane Lions ruckman Matthew Clarke , giving up picks 6 and 21, and the Kangaroos' Scott Welsh for pick 77, while trading Lance Picioane to Hawthorn for pick 79. Future stars Rhett Biglands (pick 36) and Robert Shirley (pick 67) were drafted in the 1999 national draft , and Michael Doughty was the club's first rookie selection at pick 4. , Adelaide lost their first five matches in 2000, placing them at the bottom of the AFL ladder at this stage. This continued after they had lost the last four games of the previous season; their nine-game losing streak overall remains a club record. Adelaide then won seven of the next nine matches, improving their win-loss record to 7-7 after round 14, at which point they moved into the top eight. However, the Crows finished poorly, eventually finishing 11th with a 9-13 record. At the end of the season, Mark Bickley stepped down as captain, and Mark Ricciuto took over. , Simon Goodwin won the Malcolm Blight Medal in 2000, with Andrew McLeod finishing runner-up. Scott Welsh led the club's goalscoring with 47. Goodwin, McLeod and Ricciuto were named in the All-Australian team, while Ian Perrie was nominated for the Rising Star award. The Crows traded away premiership ruckman Shaun Rehn to Hawthorn at the end of the season, receiving draft pick 12 which they on-traded to Port Adelaide for Matthew Bode . Adelaide also traded pick 23 for the Kangaroos ' Evan Hewitt . Indigenous 200-game defender Graham Johncock was drafted with Adelaide's final pick in the national draft , number 67 overall. , Adelaide showed inconsistent form in 2001; after losing their opening three matches, they won 12 of their next 18 to seal their first finals spot since 1998 with a round to spare. By defeating bottom-placed Fremantle , who had won just one match for the season, at Subiaco Oval in the final round, the Crows could have had a chance to host a final under the new top eight system implemented in 2000 , but they lost by 37 points and finished in eighth place with a 12-10 record. Adelaide won just six matches at home in 2001, an equal club worst at the time, but won a club best six matches outside of South Australia. , Adelaide played fifth-placed Carlton at the MCG in the First Elimination Final. They had defeated Carlton twice during the year, but Carlton turned the tables by eliminating Adelaide, 17.16 (118) to 6.14 (50). Their 68-point loss was their worst losing margin of the season, and Darren Jarman announced his retirement after the match. , In addition to finishing runner-up to Jason Akermanis in the 2001 Brownlow Medal , Andrew McLeod won the Malcolm Blight Medal from Mark Stevens , becoming the Medal's first dual winner. Darren Jarman kicked 40 goals to top the Crows' goalkicking, while McLeod and Simon Goodwin were named in the All-Australian team. Adelaide did not receive any Rising Star nominations in 2001. , The 2001 off-season was a busy one for the Crows. They traded away premiership-winning small forward Peter Vardy to Melbourne for pick 56, on-trading that pick to Fremantle for Daniel Schell . They also received young key forward Ryan Fitzgerald from Sydney for pick 28, who would play only eight games for Adelaide due to injury, but would later become a popular radio and television personality and a high-profile supporter of the club. Finally, the Crows received Carlton's Kris Massie and Ben Nelson in exchange for Andrew Eccles and David Gallagher . , With Adelaide's first pick in the 2001 national draft , they drafted 200-game player Brent Reilly at pick 12. They also used their rookie picks particularly well in this year: Nathan Bock (pick 25), Ben Rutten (pick 40) and Martin Mattner (pick 51) would all become renowned players at AFL level. Finally, in the pre-season draft, the Crows chose Trent Hentschel at pick 5. , Adelaide won their first three matches in 2002, and despite a mid-season slump of three losses in a row (Rounds 12-14) they finished the season in third place with a 15-7 win-loss record, both club bests at the time. The Crows won all 13 of their matches against teams that did not make the finals, but only two out of nine matches against fellow top eight teams: a 7-point triumph over reigning (and eventual) Premiers the Brisbane Lions in Round 10 and a 48-point victory over Essendon in Round 19, both at Football Park . , Under the AFL finals system , the Crows faced second-placed Brisbane at The Gabba in the Second Qualifying Final and lost by 71 points, 17.13 (115) to 5.14 (44). Due to finishing in the top four, Adelaide received a double chance and a "home" Semi Final against Melbourne , played at the MCG due to the MCC agreement . Adelaide led by 40 points at quarter time, before the Demons rallied, taking a 29-point lead late in the third quarter. However, the Crows responded with a final-quarter surge to win by 12 points, 20.10 (130) to 17.16 (118). The win gave them a Preliminary Final berth against Collingwood at the MCG. Adelaide led in the second quarter but Collingwood surged to win, 13.13 (91) to 9.9 (63), progressing to the Grand Final at Adelaide's expense. Collingwood would lose to Brisbane the following week in the first of successive Grand Finals to be contested by the two teams. , Ben Hart won his second Malcolm Blight Medal in 2002, with Tyson Edwards finishing runner-up. Brett Burton led the Crows' goalkickers with 51. Hart and Mark Ricciuto were both named as All-Australians, while for the second successive season, Adelaide had no Rising Star nominees. , In the off-season, Adelaide secured the services of champion centre half forward Wayne Carey in a trade with the Kangaroos . This was achieved by a three-way deal along with Richmond , where homesick midfielder Kane Johnson and several draft picks went to Richmond and Richmond's top two draft picks, 2 and 18, were traded to the Kangaroos. Adelaide also received Richmond defender Jason Torney as part of the deal. The Crows also traded for veteran Geelong small forward Ronnie Burns , giving up Ben Finnin in exchange. Robert Shirley was re-drafted by the club at pick 56 in the national draft , while Jason Porplyzia was drafted for the first time at pick 29 in the rookie draft. , Adelaide started 2003 by winning the pre-season competition for the first time in their history. They defeated Port Adelaide , West Coast and the Kangaroos before facing Collingwood in the final, which they won, 2.13.0.8 (104) to 1.9.1.7 (73). (An explanation of scoring is given on this page .) , Adelaide again made the finals in 2003, winning nine matches out of eleven between Rounds 9 and 19 to sit second on the ladder with a 13-6 record with three rounds to play. However, they lost all three of those matches to finish in sixth position. Eight of Adelaide's nine losses were by three goals or less, including a 5-point loss to Collingwood at the newly renamed AAMI Stadium in Round 7, where Chris Tarrant kicked the winning goal after the siren . , Adelaide faced seventh-placed West Coast at AAMI Stadium in the Second Elimination Final and won easily, 16.17 (113) to 8.9 (57). This set up an away Semi Final against the Brisbane Lions at The Gabba , which the Crows lost, 18.16 (124) to 12.10 (82): their greatest losing margin of the season. This game marked the final appearance for dual premiership captain Mark Bickley . Brisbane went on to defeat Sydney and then Collingwood to claim their third successive Premiership. , In 2003, Adelaide captain Mark Ricciuto became the first Crow to win the Brownlow Medal for the best and fairest player in the AFL in a three-way tie with Adam Goodes and Nathan Buckley .  He also won his second Malcolm Blight Medal from Tyson Edwards , and was Adelaide's sole All-Australian for the year. Graham Johncock led the club's goalkicking with 30, one ahead of Wayne Carey who booted 29. For the third year in a row, no Crows were nominated for the Rising Star award in 2003. At the end of the season, Adelaide traded for Sydney key position player Scott Stevens , trading away picks 29 and 45. Their most notable draftee in that year's national draft was mature-aged ruckman Ben Hudson , taken at pick 58. , Adelaide lost their first four matches in 2004, at which point they sat on the bottom of the AFL ladder. Victories over Richmond , Port Adelaide and Hawthorn lifted them off the bottom but they failed to win successive matches in the first half of the season. Wayne Carey suffered a serious neck injury in Adelaide's Round 12 loss to West Coast at Subiaco Oval , which left them with a 3-9 record. Carey announced his retirement soon afterwards, having played 28 games and kicked 56 goals for the club. Nigel Smart , the last remaining player from Adelaide's inaugural match against Hawthorn in 1991, also announced he would retire after the following week's match against Western Bulldogs at AAMI Stadium . The Crows won the match by 32 points, after which coach Gary Ayres was told his contract would not be renewed at the end of the season. Ayres elected to resign immediately, and assistant coach Neil Craig was appointed caretaker coach for the remainder of the season. , In Craig's first match as senior coach, Adelaide thrashed Melbourne , at the time second on the ladder, by 72 points at AAMI Stadium . The Crows lost their next three matches, including a club record 141-point loss to the Brisbane Lions at The Gabba , but rebounded to win three of their last five. Ultimately the Crows finished 12th on the ladder with an 8-14 record, including 4-5 under Craig, who was appointed Adelaide's senior coach from 2005. , Mark Ricciuto was the Malcolm Blight Medal winner for the second consecutive year, and his third overall, while Tyson Stenglein finished runner-up. Ricciuto was also the team's only All-Australian representative for the second year running, and became the first Crow to be named All-Australian captain. Brent Reilly became Adelaide's first Rising Star nominee since 2000, for his performance in Adelaide's home loss to Fremantle in Round 16.  Scott Welsh topped the club's goalkicking with 36. , During the off-season, Stenglein requested a trade to his home state, Western Australia , and was traded to West Coast for draft picks 12 and 28. Adelaide on-traded pick 12 to secure the services of young midfielder Scott Thompson from Melbourne .  In the national draft , Adelaide selected future captain Nathan van Berlo with their second pick at 24 overall, and also drafted Ivan Maric (pick 40) and Chris Knights (pick 56). , 2005 saw Adelaide have their best home and away season in the history of the club, finishing 17–5 and winning the club's first ever McClelland Trophy for finishing atop the ladder after the home-and-away season. The Crows had started promisingly after the disappointment of 2004 winning 4 of their first 6 matches, and gathered momentum as the season progressed, winning 10 matches in a row from rounds 13 to 22. The last of these was a stunning eight-point victory over hot premiership favourites West Coast at Subiaco Oval , in a match that saw them leapfrog the Eagles into top spot. , The Crows were brought crashing down to earth in their First Qualifying Final against fourth placed St Kilda at AAMI Stadium . In a tough, low-scoring contest Adelaide missed the leadership of captain Mark Ricciuto , suspended for striking Adam Selwood the previous week, and despite a late fightback they lost by eight points: 10.5 (65) to 8.9 (57). The loss set up a sudden death Semi Final against Port Adelaide , the reigning Premiers. The Crows regained Ricciuto, and in front of a crowd of 50,521 they defeated Port by a Showdown record margin of 83 points: 18.15 (123) to 5.10 (40). As a result, Adelaide faced a Preliminary Final match against West Coast at Subiaco, where they had won just three weeks before. In another tough game in windy conditions, West Coast broke away with five goals to one in a decisive third quarter, and again a final-quarter comeback was in vain as the Eagles ended Adelaide's season, 14.9 (93) to 11.11 (77). West Coast would then lose the Grand Final to Sydney the next week by just four points. Adelaide joined Essendon (1999) and Port Adelaide (2002 and 2003) as recent AFL minor premiers who had failed to make the Grand Final. , The Malcolm Blight Medallist for 2005 was Simon Goodwin , who won the award from Nathan Bassett , his second after having won it in 2000. For the second successive year, Scott Welsh led the goalscoring with 58 goals including finals. Ricciuto was All-Australian captain for the second year in a row, selected on a half-forward flank, while Ben Rutten was full-back and Goodwin was named on the interchange bench. No Crows were nominated for the Rising Star award. Adelaide traded Fergus Watts to St Kilda for pick 17 over the off-season. Notable players drafted in the 2006 national draft included future club champions Richard Douglas (pick 16) and Bernie Vince (pick 32), while Jason Porplyzia was drafted for the second time at pick 9 in the pre-season draft. , 2006 saw the Crows start the season in dominant fashion. Narrow losses to West Coast in round 2 and Richmond in round 8 - the latter noted for Richmond's controversial but successful "keepings-off" tactics - were the only blips in the radar as Adelaide stormed to a 14–2 win/loss record, with eight of those wins by 50 points or more. At this stage their percentage of 172.38 was the best since West Coast in 1991. However, the Crows faded to lose four of their next five games, starting with an unexpected 82-point thumping by West Coast at Subiaco Oval . The sudden lapse was attributed in some part to injuries to several key players: Mark Ricciuto , Andrew McLeod , Ben Hart , Brett Burton and leading goalkicker Trent Hentschel ; the last, after a breakout season, suffered a shocking knee injury against Port Adelaide in round 21 that would keep him out of the game for the next two seasons and curtail the rest of his career. , Adelaide did finish the home-and-away season on a positive note, winning their final game against Melbourne by 58 points and finishing the minor round in second place behind West Coast, with 16 wins and 6 losses. They thus entered the Second Qualifying Final at home against third-placed Fremantle , who had won their past nine games including a defeat of the Crows in Adelaide in round 19. There was to be no repeat however, as in blustery conditions with a strong breeze favouring Fremantle in the first quarter, Adelaide held the Dockers in check before running away with the game in the last quarter with the help of the wind, winning 10.16 (76) to 7.4 (46). Adelaide thus earned a week's rest before a Preliminary Final re-match against West Coast, this time to be played at AAMI Stadium . The Crows regained McLeod and Burton and started well, leading by 22 points at half-time, despite losing ruckman Rhett Biglands to a serious knee injury in the first quarter. However, a brilliant second-half performance by Ben Cousins saw West Coast come back to take the lead in the last quarter and hold on to win, 11.19 (85) to 11.9 (75), a bitter end to a year that had promised so much. For the second consecutive year, West Coast would face Sydney in a thrilling Grand Final: this time they won, by one point. , Simon Goodwin won his third Malcolm Blight Medal, and second in a row, while Tyson Edwards was runner-up. Goodwin, McLeod and Nathan Bassett were all named in the All-Australian team, while Ricciuto was the leading goalkicker with 44 goals. Again, Adelaide had no Rising Star nominees. Hart, who had become the Crows' first ever player to play 300 AFL games in round 2, was delisted at the end of the season. Draftees included Kurt Tippett at pick 32 in the national draft and David Mackay at pick 48. , The Crows showed patchy, inconsistent form throughout 2007, with previously successful coach Neil Craig criticised at times for his strict, inflexible game plan. The season had started with a shock home loss to Essendon , before Adelaide won six of their next eight games to sit in third place after round 9. This was followed by a steady slide, with just two wins in the next eight games causing Adelaide to fall to twelfth with five rounds remaining. An 8-point come-from-behind victory over eventual runners-up Port Adelaide proved the breakout; despite falling to dominant Geelong the next week, Adelaide then won their last three home-and-away matches, including a last-round win over top four contenders Collingwood at the Telstra Dome to secure eighth place and an away Elimination Final against Hawthorn , who they had defeated by 71 points during the season. In a high-scoring match, Adelaide led by 31 points in the second quarter but were reeled in by the Hawks and Lance Franklin . In a heartstopping finish, Franklin kicked his seventh goal from beyond 50 metres with only seconds left, giving Hawthorn victory, 15.15 (105) to 15.12 (102), and ending Adelaide's season. , Andrew McLeod won his third Malcolm Blight Medal in 2007, with Simon Goodwin finishing runner-up. McLeod was also Adelaide's only All-Australian representative, and was named captain. Scott Welsh was the Crows' leading goalscorer for the fourth time, kicking 49 for the season. The Crows had no Rising Star nominees, meaning they had had only one nomination since 2000 ( Brent Reilly in 2004). , The off-season saw plenty of change to the Crows' squad. Captain Mark Ricciuto retired due to persistent injuries, with Goodwin succeeding him as skipper, while Welsh walked out on the club and was subsequently drafted by the Western Bulldogs in the pre-season draft. Jason Torney , Ian Perrie and Matthew Bode were among those delisted by the club. In the trade period, Martin Mattner was traded to Sydney for pick 28, which was on-traded to Port Adelaide for midfielder Brad Symes ; John Meesen was traded to Melbourne for pick 37, later traded to North Melbourne for Brad Moran ; and Ben Hudson went to the Bulldogs along with pick 43 for picks 30 and 38. Adelaide was successful in the 2007 national draft , drafting Patrick Dangerfield with pick 10, Andy Otten with pick 27 and New South Wales scholarship player Taylor Walker with their final pick, 75. , Adelaide started the 2008 season in promising form, and at the halfway mark they sat in fourth place on the table with an 8-3 win-loss record, led by a strong defensive unit of Ben Rutten , Nathan Bassett and Nathan Bock . However, a tiring midfield and injuries to key forwards Brett Burton and Jason Porplyzia resulted in a mid-season slide similar to the previous year, with the Crows falling out of the top eight after five consecutive losses. Again, though, Adelaide finished strongly with five wins in their last six home-and-away matches, including a shock round 22 victory over the third-placed Western Bulldogs which temporarily lifted the Crows into fourth position. A 108-point win by St Kilda over Essendon the next day saw the Saints overtake Adelaide on percentage; the Crows fell to fifth, costing them a double-chance and sending them into a sudden death Elimination Final against eighth-placed Collingwood at AAMI Stadium . This proved costly as, despite a six-goal performance from Scott Stevens , Collingwood dominated after half-time to win, 19.11 (125) to 14.10 (94). , Bock won the Malcolm Blight Medal in 2008 from Simon Goodwin , and was Adelaide's sole All-Australian representative at centre half back. Burton was Adelaide's leading goalkicker, with 34 goals in only 13 matches, and Kurt Tippett because Adelaide's first Rising Star nominee in four years with his four-goal performance against Melbourne in round 8.  Nathan Bassett and Ken McGregor both retired at the end of the 2008 season, as well as Rhett Biglands who due to injury had not played since the 2006 Preliminary Final. Kris Massie was among those delisted by the club. , In the 2008 national draft , Adelaide drafted key position player Phil Davis with their first pick, number 10 overall. Other notable acquisitions included future club champion Rory Sloane at pick 44, and Ricky Henderson at pick 10 in the rookie draft. , After an indifferent start to the 2009 season, Adelaide hit form through the middle of the year, winning seven consecutive games between rounds 9 and 15. The catalyst was again their stingy defence, which held Melbourne (round 5) and Carlton (round 9) goalless to half-time, conceded just 3.6 (24) in their round 12 match against North Melbourne and restricted Fremantle to just 1.7 (13) in round 15 - the lowest score by a side in any VFL/AFL match since 1961. Losses to premiership contenders St Kilda , Geelong and Collingwood late in the season damaged Adelaide's top four hopes, and despite winning their last three matches they finished the season in fifth place for the second year running, with a 14–8 record. , Essendon visited AAMI Stadium in the first week of the finals for the First Elimination Final. After a close first quarter Adelaide dominated the match, winning 26.10 (166) to 10.10 (70) - their biggest ever finals win and third win in a row by more than 70 points. The win put the Crows into the First Semi Final against Collingwood at the MCG . Adelaide continued their good form and led by 24 points at half-time before the Magpies responded to take the lead at three quarter time. In a thrilling final quarter, the lead changed several times before, for the second time in three years, Adelaide were sunk by a goal in the dying seconds: Jack Anthony converted a free kick from 40 metres on a slight angle, giving Collingwood a five-point win: 12.11 (83) to 11.12 (78). , Bernie Vince won the Malcolm Blight Medal in 2009 from leading goalkicker Jason Porplyzia . Sharpshooter Porplyzia kicked 57 goals for the season, with only 15 behinds. Simon Goodwin was named on a half back flank in the All Australian team. Young stars Patrick Dangerfield , Andy Otten and Taylor Walker were all nominated for the 2009 Rising Star award,    with Otten finishing runner-up in the award to the Brisbane Lions ' Daniel Rich . Veteran forward Brett Burton , who returned to the side late in the season having torn his ACL the previous year, took the Mark of the Year in round 22 against Carlton .  , Adelaide drafted Daniel Talia (pick 13) and Jack Gunston (pick 29) with their first two selections in the national draft . They also picked up Matthew Wright (pick 33) and Matthew Jaensch (pick 46) in the rookie draft. Tagger Robert Shirley was delisted at the end of the season. , Adelaide had a disastrous start to the 2010 season, losing their first six matches of the home and away season. This saw Adelaide second-last on the ladder only percentage above Richmond , and overtook their start of five losses in 2000 as the worst start to a season in the clubs history. The sharp decline from their Semi Final appearance in 2009 came due to a combination of poor form and injury troubles; no fewer than six players made their AFL debut in the first nine rounds of the season. Adelaide's form improved as the season wore on, and they won four successive games finishing with a round 16 win over reigning Premiers and league leaders Geelong . This would turn out to be the final career games of club stalwarts Andrew McLeod and Simon Goodwin .   The Crows won just two of their last six games but continued their good form in pushing top four sides the Western Bulldogs and Collingwood to close margins and upsetting third-placed St Kilda in the final round. They finished 11th with nine wins and 13 losses, marking the first time under Neil Craig that the team did not make the finals. , The Malcolm Blight Medallist for 2010 was Richard Douglas , with Scott Thompson finishing runner-up. Kurt Tippett was Adelaide's leading goalscorer with 46 goals. No Crows made the All-Australian team, but Phil Davis was nominated for the Rising Star award.  Besides McLeod and Goodwin, fellow stars Brett Burton , Tyson Edwards and Trent Hentschel all announced their retirements during the season,  while Nathan Bock announced he was leaving the club to join new side Gold Coast .  , In the trading period, Adelaide traded for maligned Richmond player Richard Tambling , giving up their compensation first-round pick for losing Bock and also pick 51,  and for young Carlton ruckman Sam Jacobs , trading picks 34 and 67. They also traded Jonathon Griffin to Fremantle , receiving pick 61 in return. At the national draft , they selected Brodie Smith with their first pick, number 14 overall. Prior to the 2011 season, Nathan van Berlo was named Goodwin's successor as captain of Adelaide.  , Without their retired stars, a young Adelaide side endured the worst season in their history in 2011. After upsetting a highly touted Hawthorn side in round 1 (in a re-match of the club's inaugural match 20 years earlier), the Crows lost 12 of their next 15 matches, including nine by margins of at least five goals. After a 103-point loss to fading champions St Kilda , the club's longest-serving coach Neil Craig stepped down, handing the reins to assistant coach and former premiership captain Mark Bickley as caretaker for the remainder of the season.  Under Bickley the club won three of their next four games, but lost their final two to Richmond and West Coast , finishing in 14th place with 7 wins and 15 losses, both club worsts. , Scott Thompson won the Malcolm Blight Medal for 2011, with new skipper Nathan van Berlo finishing runner-up. Emerging forward Taylor Walker led the goalkicking with 32 goals in 13 games. No Crows were named in the All-Australian side or received Rising Star nominations in 2011. Scott Stevens retired during the season due to complications from multiple concussions, while Brad Moran also retired at the end of the season, and Phil Davis announced his defection to new club Greater Western Sydney .  , Adelaide was active on the trade table in the 2011 off-season. Promising forward Jack Gunston requested a trade to Hawthorn, and got his wish via an exchange of draft picks: picks 53 and 71 also went to the Hawks, while Adelaide received picks 24, 46 and 64.  Pick 24 was on-traded to Gold Coast for picks 27, 31 and 68; pick 31 was then on-traded to Essendon for rookie forward Josh Jenkins and pick 41, while pick 68 was traded along with pick 35 and Tony Armstrong for Sydney 's Lewis Johnston .  In other deals, Adelaide traded pick 10 and its first-round compensation pick for Davis to Greater Western Sydney for Luke Brown and pick 2 in the 17-year-old mini-draft,  and also traded out ruckman Ivan Maric to Richmond for pick 37, which was on-traded to St Kilda for Tom Lynch .  , With their mini-draft pick, Adelaide selected 17-year-old star Brad Crouch , who would not be eligible to play until 2013. Adelaide selected Sam Kerridge with their only top-40 pick in the national draft , pick 27, and drafted Rory Laird with pick 5 in the rookie draft. , Also in the off-season, the Adelaide board undertook a search for Craig's replacement as senior coach. Candidates for the role included Bickley, West Coast assistant coach Scott Burns and Geelong assistant Brenton Sanderson . Sanderson, a 200-game player and former best and fairest for Geelong who had played six games for the Crows at the start of his career, was hired for the role.  , Under new coach Brenton Sanderson , Adelaide made an immediate impression the 2012 NAB Cup , defeating Carlton and Port Adelaide in a three-team lightning round-robin match and Brisbane Lions and Collingwood in full-length matches. They faced West Coast in the final at AAMI Stadium on 17 March, and won 2.10.17 (95) to 2.5.13 (61), with Bernie Vince winning the Michael Tuck Medal for best on ground. Adelaide continued their impressive form in the home-and-away season, performing consistently and never losing consecutive matches. They eventually finished second with 17 wins and 5 losses, equalling the club's best home-and-away record set in 2005 and only missing out on the minor premiership to Hawthorn by percentage. , The Crows hosted Sydney at AAMI Stadium in the Second Qualifying Final. Despite having more forward-50 entries Adelaide converted poorly and were comfortably beaten, 11.5 (71) to 5.12 (42). This sent them into a sudden-death Semi Final against Fremantle . Fremantle started well and led by 29 points early in the second quarter, but the Crows responded with Taylor Walker kicking five goals to seal a narrow win, 12.9 (81) to 11.5 (71). As a result, Adelaide faced minor premiers Hawthorn at the MCG in the First Preliminary Final. Hawthorn led for most of the match and despite Adelaide taking the lead with five minutes remaining, the Hawks responded to win the match by five points: 13.19 (97) to 14.8 (92). Hawthorn would go on to lose the Grand Final to Sydney by ten points the next week. , Scott Thompson won his second consecutive Malcolm Blight Medal in 2012, with fellow midfielder Patrick Dangerfield finishing runner-up. Thompson and Dangerfield both were named in the All-Australian team for that year, while Walker was the club's leading goalscorer for the second year running; his 63 goals were the most by a Crow since Tony Modra in 1997. Young key defender Daniel Talia became Adelaide's first ever Rising Star, having been nominated for his round 12 shutdown of St Kilda star Nick Riewoldt , while Sam Shaw was also nominated for the award.   , At the end of the season Brad Symes was delisted and Chris Knights left as an unrestricted free agent to go to Richmond .  During the trading period, Adelaide received ruckman Angus Graham from Richmond along with pick 54 in exchange for pick 42. , Also during the trading period, key forward Kurt Tippett requested a trade to Sydney, but this was denied when it emerged that Adelaide had offered money to Tippett outside of their salary cap (up to $200,000) and agreed to trade him to the club of his choice within his previous contract, signed at the end of 2009. As a result, the club was charged with eleven counts relating to salary cap regulation breaches and tampering with the draft.  Prior to the AFL Commission hearing, Adelaide voluntarily forfeited their first two draft picks of the 2012 national draft , picks 20 and 54.  At the hearing on 30 November 2014, the Crows were found guilty and fined $300,000, as well as losing their first and second round draft picks at the 2013 national draft . The Crows' CEO, Stephen Trigg, was fined $50,000 and banned from any club role for six months, while the general manager of football operations Phil Harper was suspended for two months and his predecessor John Reid was banned for 12 months. Tippett, who was drafted by Sydney in the pre-season draft with no compensation for Adelaide, was fined $50,000 and suspended for eleven matches.  Tippett's own manager's accreditation was also revoked by the AFL Players' Association for a period of one year.  , Without its first two draft picks, Adelaide's first pick in the 2012 draft was pick 62, which they used to select Sam Siggins . Kyle Hartigan was drafted with the club's first rookie draft pick, number 14. , The Crows suffered under the weight of expectations in an inconsistent 2013 season. Early in the season, key forward Taylor Walker injured his ACL , requiring a full reconstruction and a 12-month rehabilitation period.  Walker's injury and Kurt Tippett 's departure left the club without a proven key forward, and they struggled to regularly kick winning scores. Despite finishing the season promisingly with big victories over Melbourne and West Coast , Adelaide finished one win outside the top eight, in 11th place with ten wins and twelve losses. Their round 22 win over Melbourne was their final game at AAMI Stadium as the next year they would move to the remodelled, CBD-located Adelaide Oval . , During this year there was continual development of the Crows' young squad. Emerging midfielder Rory Sloane won the Malcolm Blight Medal from Richard Douglas , while Patrick Dangerfield was an All-Australian for the second year running. Tom Lynch led the club's goalscoring with 33 in 17 matches, including 10 goals in Adelaide's round 7 win over Greater Western Sydney ; he became only the third player in Crows history to kick ten or more goals in a match.  Sam Kerridge , Brad Crouch , Rory Laird and Luke Brown all received Rising Star nominations, the most Crows nominated in any season to date.     Graham Johncock retired mid-season,  while end-of-season delistings included Richard Tambling . , Having lost their first two draft picks due to the Tippett controversy the previous year, the Crows recruited aggressively over the off-season, securing veteran key forward James Podsiadly from Geelong in exchange for pick 64 and goalsneak Eddie Betts as a free agent from Carlton .   The club also traded out former club champion Bernie Vince to Melbourne for pick 23 in the national draft .  They used this pick to draft Matt Crouch , the younger brother of Brad, while Indigenous small forward Charlie Cameron was Adelaide's first rookie draft pick at 10. , The Crows sustained several injuries in the lead-up to the 2014 season. The most serious involved its captain, Nathan van Berlo , who ruptured his Achilles tendon during training.  This sidelined him for the entire season, with Patrick Dangerfield and Rory Sloane acting as co-captains in his absence.  Prior to the commencement of the regular season, strategy and innovation coach Dean Bailey died from lung cancer at the age of 47.  , Adelaide lost their first three matches of the season, including heavy defeats to Port Adelaide and Sydney in their first two matches at Adelaide Oval . They won the next three, setting the tone for another inconsistent season. The move to Adelaide Oval paid dividends with a league-best average home crowd of 48,046, but performances on the field were poor as the club lost six out of twelve games at the venue. This ultimately proved costly as, for the second year running, the Crows narrowly missed the finals, this time finishing tenth with 11 wins and 11 losses. , Daniel Talia won the Malcolm Blight Medal in 2014 from Rory Sloane . Talia was also named at full-back in the All-Australian team, along with Brodie Smith on a half back flank. Eddie Betts led the goalscoring in his first year at Adelaide with a career-best 51 goals. Matt Crouch was nominated for the Rising Star award for his 28-possession effort against Greater Western Sydney in round 5. Long-time players Ben Rutten and Jason Porplyzia retired at the end of the 2014 season, with key defender Rutten kicking a goal – only the ninth of his career – with his final kick, in round 23 against St Kilda .   , Adelaide did not take part in the 2014 trading period until the final minutes, when they obtained Kyle Cheney and Luke Lowden from Hawthorn amidst an exchange of draft picks (receiving 43, 47 and 59 in exchange for 31, 50 and 68).  They then on-traded pick 47 along with their own pick 10 for Geelong 's picks 14 and 35.  In the draft they selected Jake Lever with their first pick at 14. , Shortly after the finish of the home-and-away season, on 17 September 2014, Brenton Sanderson was sacked as coach, with the club citing different perspectives on the team.  Three weeks later, Port Adelaide assistant coach Phil Walsh was appointed as his replacement.  On 14 January 2015, Taylor Walker was appointed the new captain of the Crows, replacing van Berlo ahead of widely tipped candidates Sloane and Dangerfield.  , Adelaide started the season with a 77-point win over reigning preliminary finalists North Melbourne , and won their first three games, sitting on top of the ladder at the end of each round. , On May 26, the AFL launched an inquiry into Eddie Betts ' signing with Adelaide after the 2013 season. This came after outgoing Carlton coach Mick Malthouse claimed to have been told by current Carlton and former Adelaide CEO Steven Trigg that Adelaide had illegally signed Betts 18 months prior to him departing Carlton.  The club categorically denied the claim, as did Carlton and Betts' manager.  Adelaide and Betts were subsequently cleared of any wrongdoing in the affair.  , Adelaide currently has two guernsey designs which are used in different matches throughout the season. , The home guernsey features navy blue, red and gold hoops. It is worn at all matches designated as home games for the club as well as in selected away games and generally at all finals. There have been only three finals matches where it has not been used - against West Coast at Subiaco Oval in 2005 and twice against Hawthorn at Telstra Dome and MCG in 2007 and 2012 respectively. It has had minor variations through its history since debuting with the club in 1991, including adding a white outline to the numbers in 1996, and removing of yellow cuffs and addition of blue strips down the sides (due to manufacturers template design) in 2006. In 2009 the yellow cuffs and full hoops returned. In 2010 the hoops were cut off again at the sides vertically replaced with dark blue. This jumper is worn with navy shorts at all home games, and usually with white shorts in away games. , The clash guernsey is a predominately white based design, worn in away games where their standard home guernsey may cause a clash of colours with the home team. It features groups of crow silhouettes in the club colours of navy blue, red and gold. It was dubbed by the club as the "murder of crows" design,  and was first used in 2013. , In previous seasons, the Crows have had variations of alternate guernseys. , The club briefly used an alternate design in the pre-season competition. It was still in the club colours, but featured the club logo prominently on the front and continuing over onto the back. , The away guernsey was originally intended for use in all matches designated as away games, except finals. The design had changed several times over the years since it was first used in 1999. From 2006 the red was removed from the top of the guernsey, moving it closer to the home guernsey. Its usage had waned since the introduction of the "clash" guernsey, to the point where it was only used twice in 2007, against the Western Bulldogs in round 2 and Collingwood in round 22. In a few away matches that year, the club also continued to use the traditional "home" guernsey, something which had rarely been done since the away strip was introduced. In response to this, a new away guernsey was introduced in 2008 featuring more red and yellow with a flying crow on the front – similar in design to the mid-90s pre-season jumper. , The clash guernsey was first introduced for season 2006 and was radically different from the "home" and "away" designs at the time. It was worn at all away games where the AFL deemed there to be a clash with the home team's gunersey design. Those clubs officially on the "clash list" included Carlton , Essendon , Fremantle , Melbourne and Richmond . Despite this, the AFL forced the club to wear it against other teams, such as St. Kilda and Hawthorn in 2007, Brisbane Lions (2008, 2009) and West Coast in 2008. The first clash Guernsey was red, and was worn from 2006-2009. The club first adopted a white clash Guernsey in 2010. It featured the club logo on the front with stylised curves in club colours on the front and back with navy stripes down the sides. It is worn with white shorts and the socks worn differ slightly from those with the home guernsey. , In 2006, the club made history becoming the first club in VFL/AFL history to have more than 50,000 members. They broke that record in 2007, signing up 50,146 members after only round one of the season. The club failed to continue this record run and subsequently signed 48,720 members in 2008. The club has enjoyed a long-standing partnership with the Toyota Camry brand since its inception, leading the club to be known in promotional materials as the "Camry Crows". , Two-time Grand Slam tennis champion Lleyton Hewitt has been the club's number one ticket holder since December 2002.  Federal politician Kate Ellis is the number 1 female ticket holder and Greg Champion , a musician and radio broadcaster, is the Melbourne number 1 ticket holder.  Australian golfer Adam Scott is also an honorary member of the club.  , – ¹ as at 12 June 2014 ^ Average home crowd excludes home final matches. , , , , While some sides named their "Team of the Century" to coincide with the AFL centenary celebrations in 1996, Adelaide only joined the league in 1991, and so later on named their "Team of the Decade", covering the period from 1991 to 2000. As well as earning selection in the team, Mark Ricciuto was named 'Player of the Decade' and Mark Bickley 'Team Man of the Decade.'  , , *Gary Ayres was told that his contract would not be extended when it expired after the 2004 season, and he decided to quit immediately. Assistant Coach Neil Craig took over from round 14 as a caretaker coach and was appointed Senior Coach for 2005 and beyond. , Head coach , Assistant coaches , , See List of Adelaide Football Club players , The Adelaide Crows entered a reserves team in the local South Australian National Football League in 2014 under a 15-year commitment.  The team is made up of AFL senior listed players and SANFL top up players.  The Brisbane Lions is an Australian rules football club which plays in the Australian Football League (AFL). The club is based in Brisbane , Queensland. The club was formed in 1996 from the merger of the Fitzroy Lions and the Brisbane Bears . Along with Geelong and Hawthorn , it is the equal-most successful AFL club of the 21st century, having appeared in four consecutive AFL Grand Finals from 2001 to 2004 and winning three premierships (2001, 2002 and 2003). , The club is based at The Gabba . The team is captained by Tom Rockliff and is coached by Justin Leppitsch . , , , In 1996, the ten-year-old Brisbane Bears had enjoyed their best season to date, losing a preliminary final to the eventual premiers, North Melbourne . However, the club was on extremely shaky financial ground and did not have many opportunities to generate revenue. , In contrast, the Fitzroy Lions , a foundation club of the VFL/AFL, had been among the bottom teams of the league for the better part of the last four decades. They had finished in last place for two successive seasons, although they contained a number of promising young players. The club was in serious trouble off the field as well. It had not had a permanent home since 1966 and had been on the verge of folding as early as 1986. , By the start of the 1996 season, Fitzroy was almost at the end of its financial tether. The club's directors agreed in principle to merge with North Melbourne as the "North-Fitzroy Kangaroos". However, that proposal was rejected 15–1 by the AFL Commission, reportedly out of concern that a merged all-Victorian club would be too powerful. Instead, Fitzroy was placed into administration, and its administrator accepted an offer to merge with Brisbane. The merged team would be based in Brisbane, and Bears coach John Northey would become coach of the merged club. However, it adopted a logo and guernsey based largely on those of Fitzroy. , The Brisbane Lions were officially launched on 1 November 1996, joining the national competition in 1997. , In their first year as a combined club the Lions made the finals, finishing in eighth position after being defeated by the St Kilda Football Club in a qualifying final. The following year, however, they finished in last position, despite boasting a talented playing list. Accordingly, Northey was sacked as coach with eight rounds remaining in the season. During the off-season the club hired Leigh Matthews , who in 1990 had delivered Collingwood its first premiership since 1958. , Matthews, who was voted "Player of the Century" in 2000, played his entire career with Hawthorn and brought many of the Hawthorn disciplines to the Lions. Within a season the Lions rose from the bottom of the ladder to fourth, before losing to the eventual premiers, the Kangaroos, in a preliminary final. , As the Brisbane Lions, the club won its first AFL premiership in the 2001 AFL Grand Final , defeating Essendon 15.18 (108) to 12.10 (82).  Lions utility player Shaun Hart won the Norm Smith Medal as best on ground in the Grand Final .  :521 On the morning after winning the flag, the club took the premiership cup to the Brunswick Street Oval in Fitzroy, the original home of the Fitzroy Football Club . It was an important way of connecting with Melbourne-based Lions fans, many of whom had previously supported Fitzroy, and of winning over disaffected Fitzroy fans who had not started supporting the Brisbane Lions post-merger by honouring the history of the club. The premiership cup then made its historic first trip to Brisbane, a traditionally rugby league -focused city. , In the same year, Brisbane Lion (and former Bear) midfielder Jason Akermanis won the league's highest individual honour, the Brownlow Medal .  :508  , In 2002, the Lions won back-to-back premierships when they again defeated Collingwood 9.12 (66) to 10.15 (75) in the 2002 AFL Grand Final in cold and wet conditions at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Early in the contest the Lions lost both ruckman Beau McDonald and utility player Martin Pike (who had already had nine possessions in the first quarter) to injury and had to complete the match with a limited bench. Despite not scoring a goal in the first quarter, the undermanned Lions overcame a spirited Collingwood in the closest grand final in 15 years. Controversy surrounded the awarding of the Norm Smith medal for best player in the grand final to Collingwood captain Nathan Buckley. The voting panel cast its votes 20 minutes before the conclusion of the match. However, Lions captain Michael Voss was dominant in the final quarter to lead his team to victory and many speculated that, had voting taken place at the final siren, Voss may have won the award over Buckley.  The voting procedure was changed for subsequent grand finals. , In the same year, Brisbane Lions midfielder Simon Black won the Brownlow Medal for best and fairest player of the 2002 season.  :508 , In 2002 former Brisbane lawyer Michael Bowers became chief executive officer as part of a move to turn around the club's problematic finances.  :51 , In 2003, the Brisbane Lions became the first grand finalist in VFL/AFL history to have three Brownlow Medallists in its line-up, the three being 1996 winner Michael Voss,  :508 2001 winner Jason Akermanis and 2002 winner Simon Black. , With a number of players under an injury cloud – and having lost to Collingwood in a qualifying final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground three weeks previously – the Lions went into the game as underdogs. However, they sealed their place in history as an AFL dynasty by thrashing the Magpies in cool but sunny conditions. At one stage in the final quarter the Lions led by almost 80 points before relaxing when the match was well and truly won, allowing Collingwood to score the last four goals. The final score of 20.14 (134) to 12.12 (84)  :860 saw the club become only the fourth in VFL/AFL history to win three consecutive premierships and the first since the creation of the AFL. Simon Black claimed the Norm Smith Medal with a dominant 39 possession match, the most possessions ever gathered by a player in a grand final.  , The 2004 season saw Brisbane remain in the top portion of the ladder for most of the season. In round 22, they set the VFL/AFL record for having the most experienced team in history. The 22-man Brisbane Lions squad had collectively played 3,718 senior career games,  and had collectively scored 3,373 senior career goals. Only four of the 22 players had not played over 100 AFL games; Jonathan Brown (89 games), Robert Copeland (73 games), Dylan McLaren (25 games) and Richard Hadley (23 games).  , Reaching the finals in second position, Brisbane controversially had to travel to Melbourne to play against Geelong in the preliminary final, due to a contract between the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) and the Australian Football League (AFL) guaranteeing one preliminary final would be played each year at the MCG.  Port Adelaide had finished on top of the ladder and hosted the other preliminary final in Adelaide. Despite this setback, Brisbane beat Geelong and reached the AFL Grand Final for the fourth consecutive year. Their opponents, Port Adelaide, playing in their first ever grand final, were too good on the day and recorded a 40-point win.  , The Lions opened the 2005 AFL season with a 23-point win over St Kilda , but the game was overshadowed by an incident involving the Saints' captain Nick Riewoldt and Brisbane defenders Mal Michael and Chris Scott . Riewoldt injured his shoulder attempting a mark, but after he stayed on the field and refused medical attention, Michael and Scott both bumped into him. Riewoldt then left the ground, and was alter diagnosed with a broken collarbone.  The Brisbane players were later cleared of any wrongdoing,  although making unnecessary contact to an injured player would become illegal in the years to come.  , The team fell away badly towards the end, losing many games by very large margins. This culminated in a record 139-point defeat by St Kilda in the final round.  They finished a disappointing eleventh – out of the Finals for only the second time in the club's history. When able to field its strongest line-up, the Lions produced some strong performance reminiscent of its triple Premiership days. However, injuries to Justin Leppitsch , Jonathan Brown , Nigel Lappin , and the retirements of Premiership players such as Marcus Ashcroft , Alastair Lynch , Martin Pike , Shaun Hart and Craig McRae had taken its toll and the club played more first year players than any other side in the competition. , The Lions began the 2006 season optimistically, but injuries again plagued the club, whose players recorded an AFL record total of 200 matches lost to injury for the season. , Justin Leppitsch was forced to retire through injury and with season ending injuries to prominent players Nigel Lappin , Chris Scott , Ashley McGrath , Richard Hadley , Anthony Corrie and key ruckman Jamie Charman . Coach Leigh Matthews was forced to debut an unprecedented number of youngsters and rookies and due to this, the club experienced inconsistent results. While many of the new youngsters displayed great promise, and continued to attack the ball and tackle opponents in typical Brisbane Lions spirit, it became evident during the final few matches that the young Lions were clearly into rebuilding mode. With AFL Rising Star nominations to Michael Rischitelli , Cheynee Stiller and Matthew Moody , and the emergence of rookie Jason Roe among others, the future looks promising, but the realists also know that the rebuilding phase will take a few years. , Despite the young team losing more home games than ever before, and reducing the Gabba's status as a fortress that intimidated opposition teams, the Lions still produced average crowds the equal of the NRL Premiership team Brisbane Broncos . , Justin Leppitsch and Brad Scott announced their retirements during the season. A controversial and high-profile feud between the club and Jason Akermanis divided supporters of the club and received massive publicity, resulting in Akermanis being stood down for the last seven matches of the season by his senior playing peer group, who felt that his loyalty to the club and playing group was compromised. , After the 2006 home and away season it was revealed that major sponsor AAPT would not be renewing their sponsorship . It was announced shortly after that Vodafone had signed a sponsorship deal with the club worth A$5.4 million over three years. , The Brisbane Lions team of the decade fullback Mal Michael announced his retirement from football on 5 October 2006 due to lack of motivation and desire to pursue other non-football related activities. While at the Lions he was one of the premier fullbacks in the AFL and was somewhat unlucky not to receive an All-Australian honour and was a pivotal figure at the Brisbane Lions, playing a significant role in each of the grand finals contested. In highly controversial circumstances, a contract loophole enabled Michael to sign with the Essendon Bombers and continue his career there. , The captain, Michael Voss , also announced his retirement from football on 6 October 2006 due to the stress placed on his body from years of football and a chronic knee injury. He was the co-captain of the team from 1997 to 2000 with Alastair Lynch before leading the side for the remainder of his career, including the historic three straight premierships. In his final season of football, Voss still played 21 out of a possible 22 games, missing one game through knee soreness which turned out to be the same knee which led to his retirement. , At the completion of the 2006 season Chris Johnson remained as the last ever representative of the Fitzroy Football Club to be playing senior AFL football. , The Brisbane Lions finished runner up in the 2007 NAB Cup and then went on to create history by being the first team in the history of the AFL to have five co-captains. They started the season with a convincing 25-point win over Hawthorn , 9.15.(69) to 6.8.(44) and a massive win, after tributes to former captain, Michael Voss , against the St Kilda Football Club , with a 52-point margin. , On 12 May 2007, the Lions marked Leigh Matthews' 200th game in charge of the team against the Crows . , One week later, on 19 May 2007, against Mal Michael's new team, the Essendon Bombers, the Lions began confidently but eventually succumbed to their biggest loss in season 2007 by a margin of 64 points. The Lions lost to Collingwood by 33 points at the Gabba in Round 9 and drew with Richmond at Docklands Stadium with the final scores 10.13 (73) apiece. , On 7 June 2007 Lions co-captain Simon Black and former Lions captain Michael Voss were charged for an assault that allegedly took place on the eve of the 2006 AFL Grand Final.  Against Jason Akermanis 's new side, the Western Bulldogs , in Round 11, the Lions yet again began confidently, kicking the first two goals of the game before being overrun. The Lions failed to score a goal in the second quarter but came back in the last to reduce the margin to 23 points, holding the Bulldogs goalless in the final term. Akermanis kicked two consecutive goals in the first quarter to take the margin out to 15 and 21 points respectively. , At a rainy Kardinia Park two weeks later, the Lions failed to score a goal in the first half and never looked like coming back, going down to their second biggest loss of the season so far. On 30 June 2007, Brisbane faced Port Adelaide and led by seven points at quarter time before being overrun in the second, the Power kicking seven goals to two to lead by 19 points at half-time. At three-quarter time, the Lions were down by 28 points and 40 points a few minutes early into the final term before they fought back to level the scores at 105-all courtesy of a Jonathan Brown goal from a free kick. A minute later a 50-metre penalty gifted Port Adelaide's Brett Ebert a goal and managed to hold on for a seven-point win. , On 22 July 2007 the Lions faced a struggling Carlton Blues side who were on the back of a 62-point thrashing to Sydney the previous week. Brisbane kicked 8.5–0.3 in the last quarter, the final margin being 117 points, Brisbane's biggest ever win over Carlton, bettering their 103-point loss to Carlton in Round 10, 1987. Also, gun forward Jonathan Brown became the first player in Brisbane Lions/ Brisbane Bears history to kick 10 goals in a match, beating Brad Hardie ( 1989 ) and Daniel Bradshaw ( 2005 ) who both kicked nine goals. This resulted in the sacking of the opposition coach after a run of poor results.In Round 17, the Lions celebrated their return to the Melbourne Cricket Ground with a 93-point defeat of Collingwood . Jared Brennan played one of the best games in his 54 game career, scoring seven goals and five behinds. , Rhan Hooper received a three match ban for striking Hawthorn's Rick Ladson , Joel Macdonald and Troy Selwood missed the must-win clash against Sydney . Brisbane started off well with Richard Hadley booting the first goal of the game but poor kicking and too many turnovers saw them trail by 10 points at quarter-time before Jonathan Brown evened the scores at 24-all at half-time. The Lions failed to score a goal in the third time-scoring 0.3 to the Swans' 3.5. However, they jumped straight out of the blocks in the first 3 minutes, with Jonathan Brown putting the Lions in front with his second for the night. But with less than four minutes remaining, Brett Kirk thought he'd won the game for Sydney only for Jonathan Brown to kick a 55-metre goal just before the full-time siren to secure a 9.9 (63) to 8.15 (63) draw. , The Lions failed to make the finals for a third successive year and lost Chris Johnson and Chris Scott to retirement. Youngster Cameron Wood was traded to Collingwood in exchange for Pick 14, which the Lions gave to Melbourne for Travis Johnstone . On the last day of the 2007 trade week , Richard Hadley was traded to Carlton for pick No. 52. , The Lions began the 2008 NAB Cup shakily, losing to Essendon by 27 points. The 2008 home and away campaign started with a game against the West Coast Eagles at Subiaco Oval , in which the Lions lost by 16 points. In their second match at home at the Gabba, the Lions wrestled with an in form Collingwood and eventually triumphed by two points. Jed Adcock scored the winning goal for the Lions. After a 17-point loss to the Sydney Swans the next week (Rivalry Round), the Lions managed a record breaking comeback against Port Adelaide after turning around a 47-point deficit half way through the third quarter, to come out winners by 20 points by the final siren. The Lions were then defeated by Hawthorn by 12 points followed by a sound victory over Melbourne by 52 points. They suffered another defeat to Geelong by 27 points followed by the Lions' first consecutive wins for the season with wins over Carlton by 33 points and St Kilda by 46 points. This was followed up by wins over North by 31 points and Fremantle by 22 points. The winning streak would eventually be snapped by a defeat from the Bulldogs by 63 points. The team struggled for the rest of the season and missed out on the finals with a 10–12 record, losing 3 games despite having at least 5 more scoring shots in each of those games. Coach Leigh Matthews resigned at the end of the season after 10 seasons and 3 premierships with the club. , The Lions made a good start in the 2009 NAB Cup under new senior coach Michael Voss by registering a 9-point win over St Kilda . However this was followed by a series of losses in the pre-season to Essendon , Melbourne and Richmond . The Lions then began the Premiership season well with wins against recent premiers the West Coast Eagles and hoodoo rivals, the Sydney Swans . However, the Lions lost their strong form against Carlton with a loss of 19 points. The Lions went on to make the finals for the first time since 2004; in their elimination final against Carlton at the Gabba they trailed by as much as five goals midway through the final quarter but came back and won by seven points. Their season ended abruptly with a 51-point loss to the Western Bulldogs the following week at the MCG. , The 2009/2010 off-season was dominated by the arrival of Brendan Fevola from Carlton, and the hype was focused on Fevola and Jonathan Brown in the sense that the Lions could capitalise on their strong 2009 season. Indeed, the Lions won their first four matches of the 2010 season to be top of the ladder after four rounds, but they would only win three more games after that to crash to a lowly finish by season's end. One of those wins however, was against eventual premiers Collingwood . , The Lions' 2010/2011 off-season was disrupted by the sacking of Fevola after just one season at the Lions, following repeated off-field indiscretions which included getting drunk in the Brisbane streets during New Year's Eve celebrations. On the field, the Lions won only four games for the year, but only one against any Victorian team, and that was North Melbourne , in Round 9. Despite their worst season since 1998, coach Michael Voss was granted a contract extension after the board recommended that Voss was the best man to take the club forward into the future. Leading into season 2012, only two players from the triple-premiership winning team of 2001–2003 will remain: Simon Black and Jonathan Brown . , In the first round, Brisbane defeated Melbourne by 45 points at the MCG. It showed promising signs for the future, with good performances from Jared Polec , Niall McKeever , Matthew Leuenberger , Todd Banfield , Rohan Bewick and Rising Star nominee Claye Beams . Older players, such as Simon Black , Daniel Merrett , Ashley McGrath , Jed Adcock and new recruit Ben Hudson also performed well. Only one change was made for round two, Jesse O'Brien was included for Sam Sheldon . The Lions suffered their greatest ever loss at the Gabba in Round 2, losing to Carlton by 91 points, with Black breaking his wrist. The following week, the Lions were beaten at the hands of Fremantle by 29 points, with the Lions recording a record low 20 inside 50's for the match since Champion Data began recording these statistics.  Round 4 then saw the Lions claim their second QClash trophy in QClash3 by a monstrous 65 points, which saw Jonathan Brown boot his 500th goal for his career. Tom Rockliff was awarded the Marcus Ashcroft Medal for his 37 possession performance. The Lions then lost against Geelong in round 5 in Black's 300th game. The Lions didn't kick a goal in the match until the 20-minute mark of the third quarter. , The 2013 season started well for Brisbane, defeating Carlton in the final of the NAB Cup , with Daniel Rich winning the Michael Tuck Medal for best on ground and Aaron Cornelius showing some good form. However, things began to decline from then, with losses to the Western Bulldogs and Adelaide . However, in the 5th QClash match against Gold Coast , the Lions won by two points, with Jonathan Brown winning the Marcus Ashcroft Medal. Injuries were beginning to take a toll, with young players Claye Beams and Jared Polec suffering severe injuries. In Round 13, Brisbane defeated second-placed Geelong , coming from 52 points down late in the third quarter to win by 5 points due to an Ash McGrath goal after the siren in his 200th match. , On 13 August 2013, coach Michael Voss was told that his contract would not be renewed.     , On 25 August 2013, former premiership player of the Lions, Justin Leppitsch, was confirmed to be the senior coach of the Lions for the next 3 seasons starting in 2014 , On 18 October 2013, Brisbane Lions legend Simon Black announced his retirement. , With the retirement of Ashley McGrath in August 2014, no active players remain from any of the club's triple-premiership winning sides.  , Crowds and memberships for the Brisbane Lions grew dramatically during the four seasons in which they made the AFL Grand Final. Since then, with the team being less successful, attendances have declined, but have remained stable over the past three seasons. In 2009 the Lions found it so difficult to sell corporate boxes that they resorted to doing so on a game-by-game basis.  2011 saw the Brisbane Lions suffer their worst ever drop in support, as memberships decreased by 28%.The 2015 season has seen the membership rise to 25,109, a decent figure but still an 18% decrease from the club's peak membership of 30,941 in 2004. Consequently, the Brisbane Lions have the third lowest membership in the AFL.  , 1 following finals matches , The three types of guernsey are: , The Lion's Mascot Manor representative and club mascot is Bernie "Gabba" Vegas, a caricature of a lion dressed in Brisbane Lions jumper, sunglasses, wide lapels and flares, designed to resemble Elvis Presley . , The club's team song, The Pride of Brisbane Town is based on the Fitzroy club song, and is sung to the music of " La Marseillaise ", the French national anthem:  , We are the pride of Brisbane town, we wear maroon, blue and gold, we will always fight for victory, like Fitzroy and Bears of old, all for one, and one for all, we will answer to the call, go Lions, Brisbane Lions, we'll kick the winning score, you'll hear our mighty roar! , Premierships , Grand Finalists , Coaches , Captains , Biggest home crowds , As of 4 November 2014: , Head coach , Assistant coaches , , The Brisbane Lions have entered a reserves team in the North East Australian Football League (NEAFL) competition since 2011. The club had previously entered a reserves team in the local Queensland Australian Football League in 1998, known as the Lion Cubs but became the Suncoast Lions Football Club in 2004 and were based on the Sunshine Coast . They would win their first premiership in 2001 when they defeated the Southport Sharks in the QAFL Grand Final. A stand-alone Brisbane Lions reserves team was created in 2011 and began playing in the Northern Conference of the North East Australian Football League . In 2012, the Lions won the Northern Conference and overall NEAFL premierships, a feat which was repeated in 2013. The Lions reserves trains and plays at the senior team's secondary training venue Giffin Park in Coorparoo, a four-minute drive from the Gabba.  The Collingwood Football Club , nicknamed The Magpies or less formally The Pies , is an Australian rules football club which plays in the Australian Football League (AFL). Formed in 1892, the club was named after the inner-Melbourne suburb of Collingwood , and was originally based at Victoria Park in Abbotsford; the club is now based in the nearby Melbourne Sports and Entertainment Precinct in Melbourne , playing its home games at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and with its training and administrative base at Olympic Park Oval and the Westpac Centre . , Collingwood is the most supported club in the AFL,   and has consistently attracted much higher than average crowds to its home games than other clubs in the league,   and had a league record of 71,516 members in the 2011 season. This spike in membership registration can mainly be attributed to the winning of the 2010 AFL Premiership.  This record was again broken in 2013, with club reaching a new high of 80,000 members. Collingwood is regarded as one of Australia's most popular clubs, being the highest attended and most viewed professional sports club in the nation.  , Collingwood's home guernsey consists of black and white stripes, matching the colours of an Australian magpie . Throughout its history, the club has developed rivalries with cross-town Melbourne based clubs Carlton , Richmond and Essendon . , Historically one of the most successful clubs in the league, Collingwood has won 15 VFL/AFL premierships, the third-most of any team. Collingwood has played in a record 43 grand finals (including replays), winning 15, drawing two and losing 26 (also a record). , The club also currently fields a seconds team in the Victorian Football League . , , , The Collingwood Football Club was established on 12 February 1892.   ,  Collingwood played its first game in the Victorian Football Association (VFA) against Carlton on 7 May 1892.  The club won the VFA Premiership in 1896. , In 1897, Collingwood, along with fellow VFA clubs Fitzroy , Melbourne , St Kilda , Carlton , Essendon , South Melbourne and Geelong split from the VFA and formed the Victorian Football League (VFL). Collingwood won its first premiership in 1902 , defeating Essendon by 33 points. , Collingwood was the most successful club of the 1920s and 1930s, appearing in 13 out of a possible 20 Grand Finals during the period. Collingwood were premiers six times during this time, including four consecutive premierships between 1927 and 1930 , a VFL/AFL record, and two consecutive premierships in 1935 and 1936 . The club's coach during this period was Jock McHale , who served as coach from 1912 to 1949. Collingwood also had three Brownlow Medallists during the period, with Syd Coventry winning in 1927 , Albert Collier in 1929 and Harry Collier in 1930 , In the 1950s, rival club Melbourne enjoyed an era of unprecedented success, winning five premierships in six years (the last coming in 1960, and having been runner up in 1954). Collingwood lost two Grand Finals to Melbourne in this decade, but bounced back to win premierships in 1953 and 1958. Collingwood's 1958 premiership is much cherished by the club as it prevented Melbourne from equalling Collingwood's record four premierships in a row. , The 1958 premiership was however to be Collingwood's last for 32 years, as the club was to suffer a string of Grand Final defeats in coming decades. , A string of eight Grand Final losses, often by narrow margins, between 1960 and 1981 gave rise to a perception that the club was prone to "choking", a phenomenon wittily dubbed "Colliwobbles".    Whether this perception is accurate remains a subject of debate;  however, the club's record in recent years has been much improved, having won two and drawn one of its last six Grand Finals. Lou Richards ceremoniously buried the Colliwobbles at Victoria Park after the club's 1990 premiership.   , The 1990 premiership team, coached by Leigh Matthews and captained by Tony Shaw , had a one-sided grand final win against Essendon , the Magpies recording a 48-point victory and ending a 32-year premiership drought which included eight grand final losses and one draw. , After this, however, the club lapsed into a state of decline; their status as a potential powerhouse at the beginning of the decade was reduced with each passing season and the club ultimately received a second wooden spoon in 1999. Within a few years, with a change of coach, playing list and club president, Collingwood reached and lost consecutive grand finals in a close contest in 2002 and a "blow out" in 2003, both to the Brisbane Lions . , Following those Grand Final losses, Collingwood struggled for the next two years, finishing 13th in 2004 and second-last in 2005; the latter meant Collingwood was eligible for a priority pick which the club used to recruit Dale Thomas . Collingwood made a return to the finals in 2006, but were defeated by the Western Bulldogs by 41 points. The 2007 season saw them finish sixth on the ladder at season's conclusion, and in the finals they knocked out the grand finalists of the past two years, Sydney , in the elimination final and then West Coast in an overtime thriller at Subiaco Oval in the semi-final. Having earned a preliminary final against Geelong , the Pies challenged the eventual premiers, only to fall short by five points. , Collingwood finished eighth in 2008 and were assigned an away final against Adelaide at AAMI Stadium . After at one point trailing in the match, the Pies went on to end Adelaide's season and earn a semi-final meeting against St Kilda . Having defeated the Saints in both their regular season meetings, the Pies lost convincingly, ending their 2008 season. The 2009 season saw Collingwood finish inside the top-four for the first time since 2003, but in the qualifying final were beaten by minor premiers St Kilda convincingly. Having won a second chance, the Pies struggled against Adelaide for the second year in a row before John Anthony kicked the match-winning goal with a minute left to send them into another preliminary final meeting with Geelong. But the season ended abruptly for the Magpies, with an 86-point loss to the Cats. , In 2010, Collingwood finished as minor premiers, and after wins in the qualifying and preliminary finals, reached the first Grand Final against St Kilda . The match finished as a draw, forcing the first Grand Final Replay in 33 years. Collingwood won the replay by 56 points. The club won a second consecutive minor premiership in 2011, and qualified for the Grand Final after a three point victory against Hawthorn in the preliminary final. However, Collingwood was then beaten by Geelong by 38 points in the decider, after trailing by seven points at three-quarter time. Star midfielder Dane Swan won the 2011 Brownlow medal with a record 34 votes. , In 2012, Collingwood once again finished in the top-four but in their first final they were convincingly defeated by Hawthorn forcing them to play in the next week against West Coast . They started their game against the Eagles trailing but after half-time they powered through to win by 13 points. The next week they were beaten by eventual premiers Sydney at ANZ Stadium , the first time the Swans had defeated the Magpies since 2005. The 2013 season was a mixed one for Collingwood, losing to Gold Coast and suffering a fifth consecutive loss to Hawthorn in Round 21, before being unceremoniously knocked out of the finals series by Port Adelaide at the MCG in the first week. Coach Nathan Buckley delisted several high profile older players at the end of the season, including Alan Didak , Darren Jolly and Heath Shaw .  , Teams of the Collingwood Football Club have, throughout the club's history, worn guernseys of black and white vertical stripes. The all white jumper, with the three black vertical stripes is the iconic strip that the club is most associated with. The current incarnation of the guernsey is mostly black, with white stripes on the front and lower half of the back, and white numbers. The main clash guernsey is the reverse of this: mostly white, with black stripes and black numbers, worn in away matches against clubs with a predominantly dark guernsey such as Fremantle Football Club and Port Adelaide Football Club . A secondary clash guernsey, introduced in 2011 and used only in matches against North Melbourne , is black with only two white stripes on each side instead of three. , Traditionally, Collingwood has worn a mostly white guernsey with black stripes. The club switched to the mostly black guernsey with white stripes in 2001.  , "Good Old Collingwood Forever" is the team song of the Collingwood Football Club. It is sung to the tune of " Goodbye, Dolly Gray ", a popular Boer War and First World War song. , The current version of the song played at the ground was recorded in 1972 by the Fable Singers.  , Carlton is considered to be the club's most bitter arch-rival (for full details see Carlton–Collingwood AFL rivalry ), with Richmond and Essendon close behind.  The old rivalry with Melbourne has faded in recent decades because Melbourne have not enjoyed on-field success at the same time; this rivalry also remains strong however and is an annual event on the Queens Birthday public holiday. Collingwood's two opponents in the themed Rivalry Rounds staged to date have been Carlton (2005–2006, 2009) and Richmond (2007–2008). In recent times, rivalries have been sparked with the new interstate clubs, including Port Adelaide , and the Brisbane Lions . , The rivalry between Collingwood and Melbourne was at its peak between 1955 and 1964, when the two played off in the grand final on five occasions. This included the 1958 Grand Final where Collingwood’s victory prevented Melbourne from equalling Collingwood’s record of four premierships in succession (1927—1930). , Collingwood's rivalry with Essendon has become more significant since 1995, when the first ANZAC Day clash took place. After the 2015 match, Collingwood have won this contest 12 times and Essendon 8 times, with the first match being drawn. , The rivalry with Port Adelaide stems from the Power being known as the Magpies in their local SANFL competition before switching to the Power when entering the League in 1997. Feelings were heightened when Port midfielder Kane Cornes 'flipped the bird' at Nick Davis following the Power's five point victory over the Magpies at AAMI Stadium in Round 9, 2002, only moments after Anthony Rocca had missed the opportunity to tie the scores. Jarrod Molloy and Brodie Holland remonstrated with Cornes after the match, with a feeling of hostility lingering after the two sides had left the field. Collingwood unexpectedly beat the Power in the Qualifying Final that season, also at AAMI stadium. Collingwood again defeated Port Adelaide in the 2003 Preliminary Final at the MCG. This added to the ‘choking’ phenomenon directed at the Power. The off-field battle over Port's desire to wear its black and white "prison bar" guernsey has been a major talking point, especially between 2002 and 2007, which added to the rivalry. A resolution was reached in favour of Collingwood. , The first signs of a Collingwood/Brisbane rivalry originated in 1999, when Brisbane comprehensively beat the Magpies in the last ever AFL match at Victoria Park . In Round 8 2002 Collingwood beat Brisbane by three points in a tense match in front of 46,279 people at Colonial Stadium . This victory over the reigning premier took the Magpies to equal top of the league table (2nd on percentage) with Brisbane. The rivalry grew with the 2002 Grand Final when Brisbane beat Collingwood by nine points. The rivalry grew again in 2003 when the two clubs clashed on four occasions. The Lions defeated the Magpies at The Gabba in Round 4 before thrashing them in Heritage Round— Round 19 at the MCG. Collingwood then defeated Brisbane in the Qualifying Final with Alan Didak ensuring victory late in the final quarter, with two goals from the boundary line. The rivalry peaked in the 2003 Grand Final with Brisbane easily defeating Collingwood to win the premiership.  In the 2004 AFL Grand Final , Brisbane, playing against Port Adelaide, had the chance to equal Collingwood's record of four premierships in a row. This caused many Collingwood fans to temporarily ignore the Port Adelaide rivalry and hope for a Power victory. Former Collingwood captain Mark Williams coached Port Adelaide to a comprehensive victory, fittingly preserving Collingwood's record as well as winning Port's first premiership. The rivalry cooled in the period following Brisbane's loss in the 2004 Grand Final due a sustained period of success at Collingwood and a string of poor seasons at Brisbane, however Dayne Beams recent defection to the Lions has seemingly reignited the rivalry.   , Games between Collingwood and Geelong have become highly anticipated since 2007. In Round 15 Geelong beat Collingwood by 16 points in a high-quality match. In the Preliminary final Collingwood surprised many when they came within 5 points of the eventual premiers. In 2008 Collingwood thrashed Geelong by 86 points—20.14 (134)- 7.6 (48) causing Geelong’s only loss of the year. In 2009, the sides again met in the preliminary final, but despite high hopes the Cats, who would again win the premiership, won by 73 points in front of another massive crowd of 87,258.  In 2010, the two sides emerged as the favourites for the flag and twice met in front of blockbuster crowds at the MCG when they were placed 1st and 2nd on the ladder—with the results evenly split. They again met in a Preliminary final, this time a resounding win to Collingwood by 41 points. In 2011, both teams were undefeated going into their round eight 'blockbuster' at the 'G. Geelong won by three points, after a controversial advantage was not paid to Magpie Scott Pendlebury in the dying minutes. Pendlebury kicked a goal and would have put the Pies in front, but the free kick was contentiously called back and Geelong managed to whisk the ball away. In the round 24 match, Geelong thumped the Magpies by a record margin of 96 points, which was also Collingwood's biggest ever loss at the MCG. The 2011 Grand Final against the Cats concluded with a 38-point loss for the Pies. , Collingwood supporters are often stereotyped as 'bogans', poorly educated and described as being toothless, among other things.  This has caused the supporters of many clubs, especially Melbourne-based ones, to have a disliking for the club,   in addition to the above more specific rivalries, however it could be argued these supporters are continuing the sectarian hatreds that characterised Australian society during Collingwood's main period of success in the 1920s and 30's.  Collingwood supporters have also been involved in many of the most highly publicised incidents of racial vilification in the history of the AFL. A report published by the Australian Human Rights Commission found that racial vilification was prevalent in all crowds and was not confined to any one AFL venue, but also singled out Collingwood's home ground of Victoria Park as the worst for racial abuse of Aboriginal players in the past.  Collingwood spectators' racial taunting of indigenous players Nicky Winmar and Adam Goodes are seen as landmarks in the history of racism in the AFL,  and Michael Long's report of vilification by Collingwood ruckman Damian Monkhorst lead directly to the establishment of the AFL's racial vilification regulations.  Eddie McGuire has been credited with reforming the club culture and harshly dealing with racist remarks by supporters.  ]] , In 2011 Collingwood reached 70,000 members for the first time creating a new AFL record, beating the previous AFL record of 58,249 set by Collingwood in 2010,.   , The club's membership base leads to large crowd pulling power which has caused the AFL to be accused of favouring Collingwood when scheduling to maximise the league's attendance figures.    However the AFL states that this is due to other clubs requesting home games at the MCG against Collingwood. , Collingwood was one of the last clubs to abandon its traditional stadium, the famous inner-city Victoria Park . Collingwood now plays home games at the MCG . It now also has its headquarters situated in the former Glasshouse Entertainment Centre . This building is also shared with the Victorian Institute of Sport (VIS). Due to a sponsorship deal, this facility is known as 'The Westpac Centre'. , Collingwood continues to be financially viable through the loyal support of its huge following and numerous sponsors. After finishing 2nd in 2002 and 2003 the team fell to 13th and 15th (out of 16) in 2004 and 2005 respectively. This trend has plagued the club since the glory days of pre-World War II VFL football. Since 1958, the club has won only two VFL/AFL Premiership (the inaugural AFL Premiership in 1990, and in 2010). Despite this, the club still has won more individual games, more finals and made more grand final appearances than any other club. , On 9 March 2007, former Collingwood and Fitzroy defender Gary Pert was appointed the Magpies' CEO, seven weeks after Greg Swann departed for Carlton. In accepting the key Magpie post, Pert quit as a club director and as managing director of Channel 9 in Melbourne. In a press conference, it was stated that Collingwood has budgeted to turn over about $50 million this year. McGuire hopes the new administration will soon double that figure. "A finance administration review has come up with how we are going to turn Collingwood in to its next phase of its life", McGuire said. "What do we do to make ourselves go from a $45 million a year turnover business to a $100 million turnover business? "They sound like big figures but in 1999 we turned over $13 million, so that is where we are heading as a football club." , The club made an operating profit of $5.23 million for the 2013 season, revenue increased from $2.6 million to more than $75 million.  , The Collingwood guernsey is the most valuable sports sponsorship in Australia.  Collingwood has different guernsey sponsors for home and away matches, generating an estimated $6.3 million worth of media exposure for the primary sponsor and $5.7 million for the secondary sponsor. These sponsorships are ranked first and second in Australia.  High profile sponsors include Emirates , Holden , CGU Insurance and Westpac . , Seniors , Premierships: , Premierships , , Played: 2,452 Won: 1493 Drawn: 26 Lost: 933 (Last updated - End of Round 11, 2015 Season) , Collingwood announced its team of the century on 14 June 1997, celebrating 100 years since the beginning of the VFL . Gavin Brown was added as the fourth interchange player in 2002, when the team was named in 1997 only three interchange players were permitted on a team.  , , This list comprises every captain of the club. This list does not include deputy captains filling in due to an injury to the named captain, but does include captains named after a player retires or steps down during the season. , Head coach , Assistant coaches , , The VFL/AFL operated a reserves competition from 1919–1991, and a de facto AFL reserves competition was run by the Victorian State Football League from 1992–1999. Collingwood fielded a reserves team in both of these competitions, allowing players who were not selected for the senior team to play for Collingwood in the lower grade. After the AFL reserves competition was disbanded at the end of 1999, the club fielded its reserves team in the new Victorian Football League during the 2000 season . , In 2001, Collingwood reserves team was dissolved and the club entered into an affiliation with the VFL's Williamstown Football Club , such that Williamstown served as a feeder team and reserves players for Collingwood played senior football for Williamstown. Collingwood ended its affiliation with Williamstown after the 2007 season. The reserves team was re-established, and has competed in the VFL since 2008.  , The reserves team currently plays at Victoria Park, and uses the AFL team's clash guernsey as its primary guernsey. The Collingwood VFL team is composed of both reserves players from the club's primary and rookie AFL lists, and a separately maintained list of players eligible only for VFL matches. , Instituted in 1981, retrospective awards were dated back to 1955; prior to that, the League awarded the Leading Goalkicker Medal , Leading Goal Kicker Medal Winners , ^ Awarded retrospectively in 2011  The Fremantle Football Club , nicknamed The Dockers , is an Australian rules football team that plays in the Australian Football League (AFL). The club is based in the port city of Fremantle at the mouth of the Swan River in Western Australia. In 1995 it became the second team from Western Australia to be admitted to the national Australian rules football competition, honouring the rich footballing tradition and history associated with Fremantle. , Matthew Pavlich has been club captain since the beginning of the 2007 season .  High profile players since the club's inception include Pavlich, the league's tallest ever player Aaron Sandilands , former captains Peter Bell and Shaun McManus , former number one draft pick Clive Waterhouse , winners of the AFL Rising Star award Paul Hasleby and Rhys Palmer , Jeff Farmer , Luke McPharlin , Nathan Fyfe and Hayden Ballantyne . , The club is coached by Ross Lyon following the sacking of Mark Harvey at the end of the 2011 AFL home and away season.  Fremantle has not won a premiership during its time in the AFL. Their most successful season to date was the 2013 season in which they finished runner up after losing in their first grand final appearance. , , , The AFL announced on 14 December 1993 that a new team, to be based in Fremantle, would enter the league in 1995. The names "Fremantle Football Club", "Fremantle Dockers" and the club colours of purple, red, green and white were announced on 12 July 1994. The decision to base the new club in Fremantle was primarily due to the long association of Australian rules football in Fremantle. However it was not represented in a national club competition until 1995, eight years after the first expansion of the then Victorian Football League into Western Australia in 1987 with the creation of the West Coast Eagles .Their first training session was held on 31 October 1994 at Fremantle Oval . , The first Australian rules match played in Western Australia occurred in Fremantle in 1881.  The harbour city quickly became a stronghold of the code, with Fremantle-based teams winning 24 of the first 34 WAFL premierships.  For over 100 years it has been represented by two strong clubs in the West Australian Football League : East Fremantle and South Fremantle . , The largest attendance at a football match in Western Australia was 52,781 at Subiaco Oval for the 1979 WAFL Grand Final between East Fremantle and South Fremantle. , East Fremantle had success against South Australian and Victorian opponents. During the 1909 post season, East Fremantle toured South Australia and played Port Adelaide, defeating the local side 12.13 (85) to 8.16 (64).  During the 1965 post season, East Fremantle played Victorian premiers Melbourne and defeated the Demons by four points 11.14 (80) to 10.16 (76).  , Champion players to have forged careers playing for Fremantle clubs include, among many others, Steve Marsh , Jack Sheedy , John Todd , George Doig , William Truscott and Bernie Naylor . , East Fremantle legend George Doig . , South Fremantle legend Bernie Naylor . , Statue of John Gerovich 's ( SF ) mark over Ray French ( EF ) , A view over Fremantle Oval and the surrounding buildings (c. 1910). , Marking contest from a Fremantle Derby between South Fremantle and East Fremantle (c. 1910) , Shortly after the club was launched in 1994, Levi Strauss & Co. , which produces the Dockers brand of clothing, challenged the club's right to use the name "Fremantle Dockers", specifically on clothing.  As a result, the club and AFL discontinued the official use of the "Dockers" nickname in 1997. However, the team was still known unofficially as "The Dockers", both inside and outside the club, including in their official team song " Freo Way to Go " and the official club magazine "Docker" .  In October 2010, the strong association that members and fans have with the "Dockers" nickname led the club to form a new arrangement with Levi Strauss & Co which allows the club to officially use the nickname "Dockers" everywhere including on clothing and other brand elements.  This name change was made in conjunction with changes to the club logo and playing strip.  , The team endured some tough years near the bottom of the premiership ladder, until they finished fifth after the home and away rounds in 2003 and made the finals for the first time. The elimination final against eighth placed Essendon at Subiaco Oval was then the club's biggest ever game, but ended in disappointment for the home team, with the finals experience of Essendon proving too strong for the young team. They then missed making the finals in the following two seasons, finishing both years with 11 wins, 11 loses and only 1 game outside the top 8. , After an average first half to the 2006 AFL season , Fremantle finished the year with a club record nine straight wins to earn themselves 3rd position at the end of the home and away season, a club record 15 wins in a year and a double chance for their September finals campaign. In the qualifying final against Adelaide at AAMI Stadium , the Dockers led for the first three quarters before being overrun by the Crows. The following week (15 September) saw the club win its first finals game in the semi-final against Melbourne at Subiaco Oval. The club subsequently earned a trip to Sydney to play in its first ever preliminary-final the following Friday night (22 September) at ANZ Stadium against the Sydney Swans , where they lost by 35 points. , In 2007, following Chris Connolly's resignation midway through the season, Mark Harvey , a three-time premiership player with Essendon , was appointed caretaker coach for the club. During his seven matches for 2007, Harvey coached the Dockers to four wins and three losses.  The club came 11th that year, and Harvey was appointed full-time coach at the end of the season. The following year saw the club slump to 14th.  , In Round 15, 2009, Fremantle achieved the lowest score in its history and of the 2000s, scoring only 1.7 (13) to the Adelaide Crows' 19.16 (130).  It was held to just one point in the first half and the only goal scored came in the third quarter. Earlier that year, in Round 4, they scored their lowest ever score in Melbourne, 4.4.(28),  against eventual runners-up St Kilda . , After finishing 6th in the 2010 regular season, the team booked their first finals appearance since 2006 and third ever home final. The team played Hawthorn at Subiaco Oval and despite being considered underdogs, went on to win by 30 points. The win came from strong performances from Luke McPharlin and Adam McPhee who limited the impact of Lance Franklin and Luke Hodge, respectively.  The team's second ever win in a finals match qualified them for a semifinal to be played against the Geelong Cats at the MCG the following week. In a one-sided contest, Geelong won easily by 69 points.  , The 2011 season saw Fremantle lose just once in the first six rounds (against Geelong ), before injury struck to several players, none more important than premier ruckman Aaron Sandilands . The Dockers ended up finishing 11th on the ladder after losing their last 7 games of the season, with the injury list growing longer each week. Key players Matthew Pavlich, David Mundy, Nathan Fyfe, Luke McPharlin (late withdrawal), Hayden Ballantyne, Adam McPhee, Nick Lower (suspended) and Matthew de Boer all missed the final game of the season against the Western Bulldogs, which was Mark Harvey's last game as senior coach of Fremantle. , Fremantle made it into the 2012 finals after finishing the regular season in 7th position and had to play the reigning premiers, Geelong , at the MCG in an elimination final. Despite being considered the underdog in the game, Fremantle managed a 16-point victory over Geelong . This win marked Fremantle's first finals win away. Fremantle subsequently lost to Adelaide in their next final, which was played at AAMI Stadium in Adelaide. , In the 2013 season, Fremantle surpassed its 2006 performance, finishing the regular season with 16 wins, 5 losses and in third position. In the qualifying finals Fremantle had to play second placed Geelong at Simonds Stadium on 7 September. After a relatively close game where the two teams exchanged the lead multiple times, Fremantle eventually overcame Geelong and ended up winning the game by 15 points. In doing so, Fremantle hosted a preliminary final for the first time in its history, in which they defeated the reigning premiers, the Sydney Swans , by 25 points. However, in their first Grand Final , the fairytale came to an end as the Dockers were defeated by Hawthorn by a margin of 15 points. , 2014 saw the club reach the finals for the third successive year, but despite earning a double chance by finishing fourth, were knocked out after losses to Sydney away and Port Adelaide at home. Nathan Fyfe was awarded the Leigh Matthews Trophy when he was voted League's most valuable player by the other AFL players.  , Fremantle were one of the least successful clubs in the league, with an overall win percentage of 44.7% as of the end of the 2014 season.  Since 2010, however, the club has played in the finals series in four of the five seasons, highlighted in reaching the AFL Grand Final for the first time in 2013 . , Fremantle played in its first drawn match in Round 8, 2013 against the Sydney Swans .  In 2006 against St Kilda at Aurora Stadium in Launceston, Tasmania they did play in a controversial Round 5 match that initially ended in a draw. However, the AFL overturned the draw result the following Wednesday after the match, due to an off-field error made by the timekeepers not sounding the siren for long enough, and declared Fremantle as one-point winners.  This was the first time a game result had been later overturned since 1900.  , Fremantle's biggest rivalry is with the other Western Australian team, the West Coast Eagles , who they play twice each year in the home and away season , in the fiercely contested " Western Derby " matches (Derby is pronounced / ˈ d ɜr b i / in Western Australia). West Coast were victorious in the first nine games, before Fremantle won in round 16, 1999. Since 2006, when the Dockers won both derbies in a season for the first time, Fremantle has been the more successful team, winning nine of the twelve games, including seven in a row between 2007 and 2010. The term derby is named after the Fremantle Derby games between East and South Fremantle in the West Australian Football League , which for almost 100 years have been considered some of the most important games in the local league.  The 1979 WANFL Grand Final still holds the Subiaco Oval football attendance record of 52,781.  , The Dockers and the St Kilda Football Club have seen a number of controversial events between them, most notably the AFL siren controversy at York Park in 2006. The match was set into a state of confusion with Fremantle leading by one point when the siren (which had not been very loud all game) was not heard by the umpires who then allowed St Kilda tagger Steven Baker to score a point after time had elapsed and, as a result, the match ended in a draw. The outcome of the game was taken to the AFL Commission and it was decided during the week that as the siren had gone Fremantle were judged to be the winners, disallowing Baker's point. , During the 2011 off-season, Fremantle controversially sacked coach Mark Harvey and replaced him with St Kilda's coach Ross Lyon in equally controversial circumstances. The move was met with much criticism towards Fremantle's president, Steve Harris, and CEO, Steve Rosich, claiming that they had "backstabbed" Harvey. Lyon was also met with widespread criticism and was accused of backstabbing St Kilda by many Saints supporters as the club was made aware that Fremantle had approached Lyon during St Kilda's lead-up to its finals campaign. Such is the large interest in the future contests between Fremantle and St Kilda for this reason, the AFL provided the two clubs a Friday night prime-time blockbuster game in Round 4 of the 2012 AFL season at Etihad Stadium . , Fremantle Football Club has its training and administration facilities at Fremantle Oval . , The team's home games are played at Subiaco Oval . Between 1995 and 2000 they also played home games at the WACA Ground . , Head coach , Assistant coaches , , The club is owned by the West Australian Football Commission (WAFC). Since 2003, a Board of Directors controls the operation of the club, on behalf of the WAFC. Prior to this, a two-tier arrangement was in place, with a Board of Management between the Board of Directors and the Commission. The initial club chief executive officer was David Hatt , who had come from a hockey background, and the inaugural club chairman was Ross Kelly , who had played for West Perth . It was a deliberate act by the commission to avoid having administrators from either East Fremantle or South Fremantle in key roles, as they wanted the club to be bigger than just representing Fremantle.  , Kelly resigned at the end of 1998, replaced by Ross McLean . Whilst he presided over some key financial decisions, including the building of the club's administrative and training centre at Fremantle Oval and the deferment of the licence fee to the AFL, it was Fremantle's lowest point onfield, culminating in a two-win season in 2001 which saw the coach Damien Drum be sacked mid-year. McLean resigned following an inadvertent breach of the salary cap .  , In early 2001 Hatt accepted a government job and Cameron Schwab was appointed. After weathering the fallout from the disastrous 2001 season, Schwab and the new chairman, local West Australian retailing businessman Rick Hart , set about rebuilding the club. A former recruiting manager, Schwab focused on building up the on-field performance by recruiting high profile players in Trent Croad , Peter Bell and Jeff Farmer , as well as coach Chris Connolly and with Hart then focused on enhancing the corporate and financial standing of the club.  The club membership grew every year from 2002 until 2008  and the final license payment was made to the AFL in 2005. , Schwab chose to return to Melbourne in 2008 and was replaced as CEO by Steve Rosich , who had previously worked for the West Coast Eagles . A year later Hart resigned as president and Steve Harris , who runs the The Brand Agency and had produced advertising for Fremantle since 2002, took over at the end of 2009. Harris had been on the board since November 2008, the first club chairman or president to have previously served on the board.  The club has developed into one of the wealthiest clubs in the league and their surprise recruitment of Ross Lyon to replace Mark Harvey as coach at the end of the 2011 is seen as an example of their ruthless drive for sustained success.  , The Doig Medal is the Fremantle Football Club's annual fairest and best award. Currently, the Fremantle coaching staff give every player votes on a 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 basis after every match, including Finals Series matches. Top votes are awarded for what is regarded as an elite performance. At the end of the year the votes are tallied and the Doig Medal Night is held to announce the winner. Variations on the voting system have been used in past years. The awards ceremony has been held at the Fremantle Passenger Terminal (1995), Challenge Stadium (1998–1999), Fremantle Oval (2000–2001), the Grand Ballroom at Burswood Entertainment Complex (2002–2005, 2008–current) and the Perth Convention Exhibition Centre (2006–2007). , The Beacon Award is presented to the club's best first year player. Mature aged recruits Michael Barlow , Tendai Mzungu and Lee Spurr have won in recent years, despite being significantly older than most first year players. , For most of Fremantle's history, players have played for various West Australian Football League (WAFL) teams when not selected to play for the Fremantle AFL team. Players recruited from the WAFL have remained with their original club, and players recruited from interstate have been allocated to teams via a draft system. Starting from the 2014 season, the Peel Thunder Football Club will serve as the host club for the Fremantle Dockers, an arrangement which will see Fremantle's reserves players playing in the WAFL for Peel Thunder Football Club . An attempt to field a standalone Fremantle reserves side in the WAFL was rejected by the other WAFL clubs.  A similar host club system was used in 1999 when South Fremantle was the aligned club but was cancelled after a single season. , Until 2011 the Fremantle Football Club used the anchor symbol as the basis for all of their guernseys . The home guernsey was purple, with a white anchor on the front separating the chest area into two panels, which were coloured red and green to represent the traditional maritime port and starboard colours. The away or clash guernsey was all white with a purple anchor. Since the end of the 2010 home and away season the home jumper is purple with 3 white chevrons and the away jumper is white with 3 purple chevrons.  , One game each year is designated as the Purple Haze game, where an all-purple jumper with a white anchor is worn. This game is used to raise money for the Starlight Children's Foundation . After the guernsey re-design to a predominately purple home jumper, Fremantle wore the starlight foundation logo, a yellow star, above the highest chevron for their Purple Haze game. , Since 2003, the AFL has marketed one round each year as the Heritage Round . Until 2006 Fremantle wore a white guernsey with 3 red chevrons, to emulate the jumper worn by the original Fremantle Football Club in 1885. However in 2007, the selected round had Fremantle playing Sydney, who also wear red and white. An alternative blue and white striped design was used, based on the jumper worn by the East Fremantle Football Club in their 1979 WAFL Grand Final win over the South Fremantle Football Club . This Fremantle Derby still holds the record for the highest attendance at a football game of any code in Western Australia, with 52,781 attending at Subiaco Oval .  , In September 2008, newly appointed CEO Steve Rosich confirmed that the Fremantle Football Club would undergo a thorough review of all areas, including the club's team name, song, guernsey, and logo in a bid to boost its marketability.  However he later confirmed that the purple colour will be maintained as it had become synonymous with Fremantle.  , The official song of the club is Freo Way to Go . The Fremantle Dockers' club song that was used from 1995 until 2011 was called Freo Heave Ho and was written in the mid-1990s by Ken Walther and unlike many of the other Australian rules team songs, it is played to a contemporary rock tune but is based on a traditional Igor Stravinsky arrangement of a Russian folk song, Song of the Volga Boatmen ,  but most of the song was an original composition by Walther. After the 2011 season, the Volga Boatmen section was dropped, leaving only the part written by Walther. , The song is regarded with a great deal of derision from many opposition supporters   and equally fierce loyalty from many fans. At the end of the 2010 season, there was speculation that the song would be changed at the same time as the jumper and logo was changed, but only a review of the song was announced.   , In October 2011, the official website of the Dockers released four options for members to vote on to be the club song in 2012 and beyond. One of the songs titled " Freo Freo " was written by Australian indie-rock group and the Dockers' number one ticket holder Eskimo Joe .  , Despite a relative lack of on-field success, Fremantle has recorded membership figures above average for the league. The club in 2005 had the fastest growing membership in the AFL competition with home crowds growing at a similar rate. The club's recent membership slogans have emphasised the passion of Fremantle fans for their team. , The Fremantle Football Hall of Legends was inaugurated by Fremantle Football Club in 1995, in recognition of the new AFL team’s links with its home city’s football heritage. The inductees are nominated by the two clubs from the Fremantle area in the WAFL: East Fremantle and South Fremantle . In time, players who represented Fremantle in the AFL will join their predecessors in this prestigious Hall. , It is traditional for each club to recognise a prominent supporter as the No. 1 Ticketholder. Fremantle originally chose to award this to the sitting member for the federal seat of Fremantle. This was roundly criticised as the member may or may not be a supporter of the club and unnecessarily linked politics with sport.  The policy was soon changed to select a well-known Fremantle identity for a two-year period. , On 23 April 2010 Eskimo Joe were announced as the number one ticketholder for the Fremantle Football Club, replacing golfer Nick O'Hern .  The band's drummer and guitarist, Joel Quartermain , hinted that they might write a new theme song for the club, saying that , We'll give it a crack. We're back here this winter writing our new record so, while we're at it, we may as well knock off a new theme song. , Other high profile fans include psychedelic rock band Tame Impala , a former Premier of Western Australia, Alan Carpenter ,  a former Federal Minister of Defence, Stephen Smith ,  Tim Minchin , author Tim Winton  and journalists and television presenters Dixie Marshall , Simon Reeve ,  American tennis player John Isner  and Matt Price , who wrote a book on Fremantle, Way to Go . , Since 2003, the Fremantle Football Club has had the Governors of Western Australia as its patron . , Vice-patrons  The Gold Coast Football Club , nicknamed The Suns , is an Australian rules football club based on the Gold Coast , which began playing in the Australian Football League (AFL) competition for the first time in 2011. The club played its first game as a part of the AFL in the pre-season NAB Cup competition in February 2011 before beginning the season proper in April 2011. , The club is the product of a sole consortium, formerly known as "GC17", tendering against established criteria for a licence to be the 17th club in the AFL competition. On 31 March 2009 the club was granted a provisional licence to join the AFL competition  and the AFL proposed that the new club would enter the national competition in the 2011 season.  The following year, during a press conference on 22 July, the club announced its new nickname, logo, club song and three new home, away and clash guernseys. , , , In January 2008, it was reported that the AFL officially registered the name Gold Coast Football Club Ltd with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).  The registration was effective from 24 December 2007.  In March 2008, the AFL won the support of the league's 16 club presidents to establish a side on the Gold Coast and an 18th side in Western Sydney. , AFL CEO Andrew Demetriou announced in early 2008 that the club could debut in the Queensland State League in 2009 as it recruits players and prepares for its debut season in the AFL.  Amongst the first players targeted by the Gold Coast were current St Kilda captain and Gold Coast junior Nick Riewoldt ,  Hawthorn forward and 2008 Coleman Medallist Lance Franklin  and Adelaide forward Kurt Tippett .  They did not end up getting any of them. , In June 2008 it was announced that the new team would play in the TAC Cup in 2009  and then in the VFL in 2010. , Guy McKenna was appointed coach in August 2008.  In early 2009, the Host Plus superannuation fund was named as the club's major sponsor.  On 15 May 2009, it was announced that highly respected Essendon administrator Travis Auld would be the CEO of "GC17".   Former Brisbane Lions Shaun Hart and Gold Coaster Marcus Ashcroft were also appointed to the coaching panel. On 1 October 2009, the club announced it had signed Guy McKenna as head coach until 2012.  , In early 2009, the Queensland Government announced that it would contribute sufficient funds allowing the redevelopment of Gold Coast Stadium. The capacity of the new stadium will be 25,000 and is scheduled to be complete in May 2011. All home matches other than the games versus Brisbane Lions will be played at the new Gold Coast Stadium. They have also been confirmed to play their first AFL game at The Gabba in Round 2 against Carlton after a bye in Round 1.  Their first game at the new stadium will be against Geelong in round 10, 2011. Also amongst the blockbuster games at home for the Suns in 2011 are both 2010 AFL Grand Finalists Collingwood and St Kilda (both of whom the Suns will only play once) and Geelong . , The club's junior squad competed in the 2009 TAC Cup under 18 competition winning a number of games, eventually finishing in 5th place. They defeated the Northern Knights in the elimination final but then lost their semi final to the Geelong Falcons . These are the results and fixture for the 2009 season:   , , In November 2009 the team signed twelve 17 year olds around the country to compete in the VFL year through the under age access rules. These players included Luke Russell ( Burnie ), Maverick Weller ( Burnie ), Taylor Hine ( Calder ), Josh Toy ( Calder ), Matt Shaw ( Dandenong ), Piers Flanagan ( Geelong ), Hayden Jolly ( Glenelg ), Alex Keath ( Murray ), Jack Hutchins ( Sandringham ), Tom Nicholls ( Sandringham ), Brandon Matera ( South Fremantle ), Trent McKenzie ( Western Jets ). , The Gold Coast was also given permission (by the AFL) to play David Swallow in 2010, despite not being the correct age. The deal that was struck with the AFL stated that Swallow would still need to go through the 2010 AFL Draft to officially join the team, while the other under age recruits contracts would run through 2011. , These are the results and fixture for the 2010 season, in which the club competed in the VFL .  , , , Gold Coast had a bye in Round 1, and played its first AFL game debuted in Round 2 on 2 April 2011 against Carlton at the Gabba in front of a crowd of 27,914. The first five goals were scored by Carlton, before Charlie Dixon scored the first ever goal for the Gold Coast Suns. Carlton went on to win by 119 points. Gold Cost won its first game in Round 5 on 23 April 2011, defeating Port Adelaide at AAMI Stadium . Gold Coast trailed by 40 points late in the third quarter, before coming back to win by three points, after Port Adelaide's Justin Westhoff missed a set shot after the siren.  Michael Rischitelli was the best on ground. , Gold Coast won two more matches for the season, winning the inaugural QClash against Brisbane Lions in Round 7 by eight points, and defeating Richmond by 15 points in Round 17 in the first AFL match ever played at Cazaly's Stadium in Cairns . However, the Suns also suffered several more very heavy defeats during the year, including a 139-point loss to Essendon in Round 6 – in which Essendon scored a record 15.4 (94) in the first quarter – and a 150 point loss against Geelong in Round 20. The Suns went on to win the wooden spoon . , Gold Coast endured a poor pre-season in 2012 which included a 13-point loss to fellow AFL newcomers Greater Western Sydney . Their solitary win in that time was a narrow win over Melbourne in the triangular round of the 2012 NAB Cup . , The home-and-away season did not begin well for the Suns either, losing their first fourteen matches in succession to be the only winless team after Round 15 of the 2012 AFL season . Among the losses included losses by more than ninety points to Collingwood and St Kilda (twice), seven-point losses to Fremantle and North Melbourne at home and a 27-point loss to the newest AFL franchise, Greater Western Sydney . Their fourteen losses to start the season was the worst by any team since Fremantle lost its first 17 matches of the 2001 season . Their horror start to the season ended in round 16 with a narrow 2 point win against Richmond. They had a lead of up to 36 points halfway through the second quarter, which then shrank to 24 points after 2 quick goals before half time from Richmond. Richmond then had a six to two goal quarter, snatching the lead back. The lead then went to 18 points Richmond's way before Gold Coast snatched it back to just 4. With 5 seconds left, a kick from the right forward pocket in Gold Coast's 50 was marked by Karmichael Hunt. After the siren sounded he kicked the goal to make Gold Coast 2 point winners.  , The Suns then won two more matches for the season, a 30-point win against Greater Western Sydney in Round 20 and a 12-point upset win over Carlton in Round 22, both at home. The team finished 17th at the end of the season, only above Greater Western Sydney on the AFL ladder. , In November 2012 the club announced their "20-ONE-3" plan that targets a premiership and 20,000 members by the conclusion of the 2015 AFL season, although this was criticised as being overly ambitious.  , In the 2013 AFL season to date Gold Coast have made a much improved effort, highlighted by victories over seasoned opponents in Collingwood, St Kilda , the Western Bulldogs and North Melbourne . Their improvement on the past two seasons has been so stark that they were considered possibilities of securing an unlikely finals berth up until the final round after Essendon lost all their premiership points.  The Suns finished with 8 wins for the season and ended the season placed 14th on the ladder. Captain Gary Ablett won his second Brownlow Medal , the first such medalist to play for Gold Coast. , Despite losing veterans Jared Brennan and Campbell Brown ahead of the 2014 season , some experts predicted Gold Coast to "give the top 8 (finals) a nudge",  though the general consensus was that the Suns would likely finish around 13th.  , Gold Coast began the season promisingly, recording an 18 point victory over Richmond before a difficult road trip to Perth in Round 2 to meet 2013 Grand Finalists Fremantle. Despite a huge loss to Hawthorn at home, the Suns excelled in the first half of the season, entering Round 11 with a 7-2 record following impressive wins on the road against Melbourne, North Melbourne (who had defeated minor premiers Sydney three weeks earlier), and St Kilda. , After captain Gary Ablett was injured in a win over Collingwood in round 16, the club went on to lose the next two matches, including one in the QClash against Brisbane. In round 19, the club recorded its inaugural win without their captain, defeating St Kilda. The club went on to lose the remaining matches of the season, finishing in 12th. Inaugural coach Guy McKenna was sacked at season's end, leaving the club after 88 games in charge and winning just over 25% of them.  , Gold Coast began playing at Carrara Stadium in their foundation year of 2009. Although the ground had existed since 1987, the Gold Coast Football Club's establishment in late 2008 prompted the club to use the stadium as their home ground during the 2009 TAC Cup . The ground opened in 1987 and was used by the Brisbane Bears for the first six years of existence and was later used by the North Melbourne Kangaroos and several professional Rugby League teams. , The insufficient and outdated facilities at Carrara Stadium led to the Australian Football League investigating several stadium options for the Gold Coast's inaugural AFL season in 2011. A new $172 million stadium in Helensvale was a strongly considered option.   The AFL eventually brokered a deal with the Gold Coast City Council and the Queensland Government to redevelop Carrara Stadium. The $144.2 million upgrade would increase the stadium capacity to 25,000. , Construction for the redevelopment of Carrara Stadium began in December 2009 and the Gold Coast was required to find a new home ground for the 2010 VFL season . The team shared their games among local grounds Fankhauser Reserve , H & A Oval and Cooke-Murphy Oval . The redevelopment ran into the 2011 AFL season and the Gold Coast were again required to find a temporary home ground. The Suns elected to use the Gabba for their first three home games of the 2011 season. , The redeveloped Carrara Stadium (commercially known as Metricon Stadium) was officially opened on 22 May 2011 by Queensland Premier Anna Bligh . Six days later the Gold Coast Suns hosted their first home match at the redeveloped Carrara Stadium against the Geelong Cats in front of a sell out crowd. Two months later, the Suns attracted the largest crowd ever at the Carrara Stadium in a game against Collingwood that attracted an attendance of 23,302, a record broken in round 16 of 2014 when 24,032 attended also against Collingwood. , The stadium will once again be upgraded in 2018 to a seating capacity of 40,000 as part of the Gold Coast's successful bid to host the 2018 Commonwealth Games . , The three types of guernseys are: , The Suns' Mascot Manor representative and club mascot is Sunny Ray. , The team song is Suns of the Gold Coast Sky .   , A three-man committee of former Brisbane Lions chairman Graham Downie, Southport Sharks director Alan Mackenzie and lawyer and community leader John Witheriff established the club's administration.  As part of the AFL bid criteria, the GC17 consortium required a commitment from 20,000 locals to become football club members, a $5 million net asset base and 111 sponsors (at least one major, 10 secondary level and 100 tertiary) by mid-October 2008.  , In the leadup to the 2009 AFL Draft , the AFL allowed the Gold Coast to recruit 12 players born between January and April 1992, with all other AFL clubs being restricted to players born in 1991 or earlier. , Karmichael Hunt , a former professional rugby league player with the Brisbane Broncos and rugby union side Biarritz Olympique in France's Top 14 , was signed to swap codes to play for the Gold Coast from 2010.  , Gary Ablett, Jr. , dual premiership player with Geelong and winner of the 2009 Brownlow Medal , signed a deal reportedly worth $9.6 million over five years to captain the Gold Coast during their starting years.  , Other significant signings to the current junior team that played in the VFL included Stanis Susuve (a member of Papua New Guinea 's International Cup winning team ) and Brandon Matera (whose father Wally Matera and uncles Peter and Phil all played senior AFL football with the West Coast Eagles).  , At the end of 2010 season, the club had been given the following concessions:  , Head coach , Assistant coaches , , The Gold Coast Suns have fielded a reserves team beneath the AFL team in the North East Australian Football League (NEAFL) competition since 2011. The reserves team has been reasonably competitive, qualifying for finals on two out of four occasions, notwithstanding a disastrous 2014 campaign which saw the team fail to win a match all season. , TAC Cup , AFL , NEAFL (Reserves) , All-Australian team , Leigh Matthews Trophy , Brownlow Medal , Ron Evans Medal , Suns TV is a television program hosted by Jessica Skarratt that is carried by the Seven Network and is shown thirty minutes prior to Gold Coast Suns games in Queensland. The program features highlights as well as interviews with players and coaches in the lead up to the match being played that week.  The Greater Western Sydney Giants , nicknamed the GWS Giants or just Giants , is an Australian rules football club which plays in the Australian Football League (AFL). Representing the Greater Western Sydney area and Canberra,   the club is based at the Tom Wills Oval in Sydney Olympic Park .   The team's primary home ground is Sydney Showground Stadium at Sydney Olympic Park . Four games a year are played at Manuka Oval in Canberra as part of a deal with the government of the Australian Capital Territory . A reserve team , the UWS Giants , participates in the North East Australian Football League (NEAFL), as part of a partnership between the club and the University of Western Sydney .  The commercial club entity itself is a 100% wholly owned subsidiary of the AFL Commission . , , , The idea of an AFL team from western Sydney originated from the AFL's plans in 1999 to make the North Melbourne Football Club (known then simply as the Kangaroos) Sydney's second team. Following the momentum of the relocated Swans Grand Final appearance, the AFL had backed the move for North Melbourne, a club which had then previously gained market exposure by defeating the Swans in their first re-location Grand Final appearance. However the venture was unsuccessful and after several games a season North Melbourne never managed to draw crowds of over 15,000 at the Sydney Cricket Ground before finally leaving the market and experimenting with Canberra and later the Gold Coast . [ citation needed ] , The AFL's interest in the Western Sydney market appeared to be rekindled after the Sydney Swans' second, more successful Grand Final appearance in 2005 , which started grassroots interest in the game in the highly populous region. [ citation needed ] In 2006, the AFL introduced the NSW Scholarships scheme, primarily aimed at juniors in West Sydney market to foster home grown talent and produce AFL players, a region which despite its large and growing population, had produced few professional Australian Footballers. [ citation needed ] The AFL was buoyed when it gained the support of then NSW premier Morris Iemma in late 2006, and the league became a partner in the Blacktown sporting facility in Rooty Hill, New South Wales . The facility was announced as the new home base for its team out of western Sydney in 2007; it announced that it had planned to grant its 18th licence in mid to late 2008. In January 2008, the AFL officially registered the business name Western Sydney Football Club Ltd with ASIC .   , In March 2008, it was revealed by the media that the AFL had considered a radical proposal to launch an Irish-dominated team in Sydney's western suburbs, which would perform before an international audience under the "Celtic" brand name. The "Sydney Celtics" plan was first put to AFL chief executive Andrew Demetriou in early 2007 by Gaelic Players Association executive Donal O'Neill. It was said that the proposal originated at the International Rules series in Ireland in late 2006 when O'Neill put forward a plan to purchase an AFL licence in Sydney. However, the idea never materialised and the AFL has since stated that this was never a serious option.   , In March 2008, the AFL won the support of the league's 16 club presidents to establish an eighteenth side in Western Sydney.  The Western Sydney working party devising player rules and draft concessions for the second Sydney team met on 22 July 2008. , During 2008, the AFL Commission , whose agenda was to make a final decision on the Western Sydney Football Club, delayed it on multiple occasions. During the same year, in November, the AFL announced a A$ 100 million venture for a boutique stadium at the Sydney Showground , in the city's west.  , After a third meeting in Sydney in November, the AFL cited the Economic crisis of 2008 as being a key factor in the delays. While the AFL reiterated its stance on the Western Sydney licence, the commission admitted that the delay in the decision was due to financial remodeling of the bid in response to the crisis, and conceded that the debut of the team in the AFL may eventuate one or more seasons later than initially suggested. The expansion licence drew increasing media skepticism and public criticism, particularly in the light of a poor finals attendance in Sydney,  declining Sydney Swans attendances and memberships, the economic crisis and the Tasmanian AFL Bid which had gained significant momentum and public support during 2008. An Australian Senate enquiry into the Tasmanian AFL Bid concluded that Sydney had "insurmountable cultural barriers" to the establishment of a second AFL team.  , In May 2009, AIS/AFL Academy coach Alan McConnell was appointed as the club's high performance manager. McConnell was the first full-time appointment for GWS and his new role commenced on 1 July 2009. Kevin Sheedy was appointed inaugural coach in November 2009, signing a three-year contract.  His role commenced on 2 February 2010. His first senior assistant coach was former premiership coach of Port Adelaide, Mark Williams.  Williams left the role at the conclusion of 2012, in order to become a development coach  at the Richmond Tigers. , In November 2010 Skoda Australia was announced as the team's first major sponsor, signing a three-year contract which included naming rights to the team's home ground at the Sydney Showground.  SpotJobs became a sponsor in March 2015. They will feature on the back of the Giants’ playing jerseys for home matches in Sydney and Canberra and on the front of the jerseys for all the team’s away games.  , On October 4, 2012, Greater Western Sydney confirmed Leon Cameron as its new senior assistant coach for next year. , Greater Western Sydney were provided with similar recruitment entitlements to the Gold Coast who had entered the AFL the year before the Giants. Key differences included that their access to an uncontracted player from each other AFL club was able to be acted on in either 2011 or 2012. The club was also allocated the ability to trade up to four selections in a "mini-draft" of players born between January and April 1994, that would otherwise not be eligible to be drafted until the 2012 AFL Draft . They also were given the first selection in each round of the 2011 AFL Draft as well as selections 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 15 in the first round of the draft.  , The 2011 Trade Week saw the Giants take part in nine trades, involving two selections in the mini-draft as well trading away players who had previously nominated for the draft in return for additional early draft selections in the 2011 AFL Draft , that resulted in them holding the first five draft selections and 11 of the first 14.  , During the 2011 season, there was much speculation about which uncontracted players would sign with the Giants. In August 2011, Adelaide defender Phil Davis became the first player to announce that he would sign with the new club.  During 2011, four more AFL listed players announced they would be playing for the Giants in 2012 - Bulldogs midfielders Callan Ward and Sam Reid , Fremantle midfielder Rhys Palmer and Melbourne midfielder Tom Scully . , Former Melbourne Captain James McDonald , Brisbane veteran Luke Power and Port Adelaide ruckman Dean Brogan and midfielder Chad Cornes came out of retirement to play for the Giants in 2012.  McDonald and Power took on roles as playing Assistant Coaches. , Greater Western Sydney also recruited Israel Folau , a former rugby league player, from the Brisbane Broncos . , Before entering the AFL, the club played in the TAC Cup in 2010 and North East Australian Football League in 2011, as well as the 2011 and 2012 AFL pre-season tournaments , and the 2011 Foxtel Cup .   , The club played its first game in the Australian Football League on 24 March 2012 at ANZ Stadium in the inaugural Sydney Derby against the Sydney Swans which they lost by 63 points. On 12 May 2012 the club recorded its first win, defeating the Gold Coast Suns in a Round 7 match by 13.16 (94) to 9.13 (67). The only other victory of the team's inaugural season was a 34 point win over Port Adelaide. Greater Western Sydney's percentage of 46.17 was the lowest by any club since St Kilda, in 1955 , had a percentage of 45.4 and, before that, Melbourne in 1919 with 43.0. , The Giants had numerous big losses, including five by over 100 points, beating the previous record of four set by Fitzroy in their final season , the Brisbane Bears in 1991 , St Kilda in 1985 and Footscray in 1982 . They lost four other games by over 80 points and finished with a percentage of 46.17. In doing so they earned the lowest percentage of any team since the AFL began seasons under its new name in 1990. , In their second season , Greater Western Sydney fared even worse than in their debut season. The Giants lost their first seventeen games, an ignominy suffered only by Fremantle in 2001 , St. Kilda in 1910 and seven teams who finished with an 0-18 record . The most recent of these VFL/AFL teams who lost all eighteen games was Fitzroy in 1964 . Greater Western Sydney's combined percentage for their first two seasons is in fact the lowest by any club since St. Kilda in 1901 and 1902 . Furthermore in a repeat to their 2012 AFL season, the Giants lost 5 games by 100 points or more. , In Round 19, they avoided becoming the eighth team to ever go through a season winless, winning their first game of the year against Melbourne to snap a 21 game losing streak. Leading into the final round of the home and away season, Jeremy Cameron kicked 62 goals this season and was equal third in the race for the Coleman Medal , two goals behind the leader, Jarryd Roughead . , At the end of the season, head coach Kevin Sheedy stood aside in place of Leon Cameron , who had been assistant to Sheedy in 2013.  On Thursday 19 December 2013, it was announced that Sheedy had been appointed to the club's board. Club Chairman, Tony Shepherd, highlighted Sheedy's importance when he said, "In many ways Kevin Sheedy is the father of the Giants. He's been here from the start and has helped build the Giants."   , Greater Western Sydney started their third season impressively winning two of their first three games, including beating their much-fancied cross-town rivals, the Sydney Swans 15.9 99 to 9.13 67 in their first round encounter at Spotless Stadium .  On 13 May 2014, Greater Western Sydney midfielder Toby Greene was charged with a number of offences including assault with a dangerous weapon and intentionally causing serious injury over an alleged assault in a Melbourne licensed venue the previous night.  , Before the start of the 2015 AFL Season, the Giants managed to sign Ryan Griffen in addition to re-signing Jeremy Cameron . , On 16 November 2010, Greater Western Sydney announced their club guernseys and their nickname of the "Giants".  , The team colours are orange, charcoal and white, with the club unveiling two prospective home jumpers for fans to be decided on for the inaugural 2012 season. One was orange with a large, stylised charcoal "G" in the centre and charcoal side panels on the sides, with the other featuring an orange yoke in the top half and a white "G" wrapped around charcoal colours in the bottom half. The colour of the team's shorts is charcoal and their socks are orange with charcoal fold-downs. During the 2011 season a clash guernsey was unveiled. The jumper has a light grey background with a charcoal rendition of the home jumper's G on the chest. This was altered in the 2012 season for a white jumper with charcoal collar and cuffs, charcoal "G" symbol in the centre and orange and charcoal stylised shoulder pads. , The clash guernsey changed in 2014, to a white top with an G that was slightly smaller than the home jumper. Included on the guernsey was also a large diagonal section of charcoal from the players left cuff down towards the centre of the bottom hem. This is repeated on the back, with the orange "G" being replaced with an orange line next to the charcoal section. The guernsey featured charcoal cuffs, numbers and collar.  , The team motto is Think Big. Live Big. Play Big. Their mascot G-Man was unveiled on 18 February 2012 before the team took the ground for their first NAB Cup match of 2012. , The team song There's A Big Big Sound was first unveiled to the foundation members and 2012 members on 16 February 2012 via a phone call, the following day the team song was released to the public. The song was written and produced by award-winning Australian artist Harry Angus of Australian band The Cat Empire .  , The Giants' training ground is located at Sydney Olympic Park , and was named Tom Wills Oval in 2013 in honour of Australian football pioneer Tom Wills , who was born in New South Wales and has family connections to Western Sydney.  , The Giants are expected to play four games a year at Manuka Oval (three regular season, one preseason) for the first 10 years after signing a deal with the ACT Government worth $23 million. A Canberra logo will be incorporated on its guernsey, with a separate Canberra guernsey being used for games at Manuka. The Giants also played in a special Guernsey as part of the centenary of Canberra celebrations, stating that the team is "part of the Canberra community".  GWS-ACT Academy is also intended to be created, with the territory also gaining representation on the club's board.   , The inaugural co-captains of the club were Phil Davis , Luke Power and Callan Ward . Both Davis and Ward were retained as captains in 2013, whilst Tom Scully was added to the leadership group as a Vice-Captain. , Head coach , Assistant coaches , Ins , Outs , W-L-D , W-L-D , W-L-D  The Melbourne Football Club , nicknamed the Demons , is an Australian rules football club, playing in the Australian Football League (AFL). It is named after and based in the city of Melbourne , Victoria , and plays its home games at the Melbourne Cricket Ground . , Melbourne is the world's oldest professional club of any football code. The club's origins can be traced to an 1858 letter in which Tom Wills , captain of the Victoria cricket team , calls for the formation of a "foot-ball club" with the need of a "code of laws". An informal Melbourne team played that winter and was officially formed in May 1859 when Wills and three other members codified "The Rules of the Melbourne Football Club" —the basis of Australian rules football. The club was a dominant force in the earliest Australian rules football competition, the Challenge Cup , and was also a foundation member of the Victorian Football Association (VFA) in 1877 and the Victorian Football League (VFL) in 1897, which later became the national Australian Football League (AFL). Melbourne has won 12 VFL/AFL premierships, the latest in 1964 . , The club celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2008 by naming 150 Heroes , as well creating a birthday logo which appears on its official guernsey. , The football club has been a sporting section of the Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC) since 2009, having previously been associated with the MCC between 1889 and 1980.  , , , The seeds of the Melbourne Football Club were established in 1858 with meetings involving influential cricketer Tom Wills , Scotch College headmaster Thomas H. Smith and Melbourne Cricket Club member and publican Jerry Bryant, a personal friend of Wills. A letter Wills wrote that year was the catalyst in the push to establish football teams with a " code of laws ". Melbourne, as an entity, was founded in 1858, however, did not begin playing until the following year, and had a link to the Melbourne Cricket Club through some of its players playing for the cricket club. , On 14 May 1859, the Melbourne Football Club was founded. During a couple of meetings held on 17 and 21 May,  the first set of rules for the game of Australian rules football were written. Those in attendance included Tom Wills , William Hammersley , J. B. Thompson and Thomas H. Smith . , The first mention of a football game played by the club is between Melbourne and South Yarra in July 1859, with Hammersley as inaugural captain.  , In 1861, Melbourne participated in the Caledonian Society's Games, but lost the trophy to the Melbourne University Football Club . The club pushed for its rules to be the accepted rules, however many of the early suburban matches were played under compromised rules decided between the captains of the competing clubs. , Although some Melbourne players and officials were associated with the cricket club, the football club was not initially allowed to use the Melbourne Cricket Ground , so it used a nearby field at Yarra Park as its home ground instead. , By 1866 several other clubs had also adopted an updated version of Melbourne's rules (which were drafted by H.C.A. Harrison ). , During the 1870s, Melbourne fielded teams in the Seven Twenties and South Yarra Cup competitions. , After a visit to England by one of the club's officials, the colours of red and green were officially adopted by the club. Shortly following, the club began wearing a predominately red strip and became informally known by supporters as the "Redlegs". , The name "Redlegs" was coined after a Melbourne official returned from a trip to England with one set of red and another of blue woollen socks. Melbourne wore the red set while the blue set were, allegedly, given to the Carlton Football Club . This may be the source of Carlton's nickname, 'The Blueboys'. , In 1877, the club became a foundation member of the Victorian Football Association (VFA). During the same year the club took part in the first interstate football match involving a South Australian side, Victorian , defeating the home side 1-0.  During this time, the club was known as the " Fuchsias ". Melbourne never won a VFA premiership, although they were consistently one of the stronger teams in the competition, finishing runner-up four times, to Carlton in 1877 (the inaugural year of the VFA), to Geelong in 1878 and twice to Essendon in 1893 and 1894. , In 1889, the MFC was reincorporated into the MCC, and for many years the two organisations remained unhappily linked. The MFC's close association with the MCC allowed it to claim the MCG as its home ground and gave it access to a wealthy membership base, but Melbourne's reputation as an "establishment" club was not always an advantage. MCC members have the automatic right to attend all events at the ground, including MFC football games. This meant many potential members had a reduced incentive to join the football club, and Melbourne's membership remained one of the lowest in the competition. , In 1897, the MFC was part of the breakaway Victorian Football League , and has been a part of the competition ever since. The team became known as the "Redlegs". This nickname is still used by some members and supporter groups within the club. , In 1900 Melbourne won its first VFL premiership, defeating Fitzroy . Melbourne's greatest player of these early years of the VFL was Ivor Warne-Smith , who in 1926 won the club's first Brownlow Medal , the League's annual award for the fairest and best player. In that year Melbourne won its second flag. Warne-Smith went on to win a second Brownlow in 1928. , Frank 'Checker' Hughes became Melbourne's coach in 1933, and under his leadership the club entered a golden age. He was the driving force behind changing the club's nickname from the Fuchsias to the Demons.  , In 1939, 1940 and 1941 Melbourne won its third, fourth and fifth flags. In 1946 Don Cordner became the second Demon to win the Brownlow. In 1947 Fred Fanning kicked a record 18 goals in the last game of the season. The following season Melbourne played the first ever drawn Grand Final, against Essendon , and went on to win the premiership the following week. , Norm Smith became Melbourne's coach in 1952, and the following season Ron Barassi played his first game. These two were to take Melbourne to new heights in the coming years. The Demons made the Grand Final in 1954, losing to Footscray , won the flag in 1955, 1956 and 1957, lost to Collingwood in 1958, and then won again in 1959 and 1960 with Smith as Coach and Barassi as Captain. , 1964 Melbourne won its 12th flag , defeating Collingwood, at the end of the season, Barassi left the club to become captain-coach of Carlton . The following season Norm Smith was sacked after a dispute with the club. Although he was soon reinstated, things were never the same again for the Demons. The club appeared in Grand Finals from 1954–1960 and every Finals' Series from 1954–1964. , After the 1954 Grand Final loss to Footscray, no team was able to score 100 points against the club until Collingwood in round 5 1963. The next team was Geelong with 110 in round 1 1964. The 1965 season started with eight wins but only two wins from the next 10 games saw the end of the era. They would have to wait until 1987 for Melbourne to make the finals again. , Poor recruiting zones and management meant that Melbourne, under coaches John Beckwith (1968–70), Ian Ridley (1971–73), Bob Skilton (1974–77), Dennis Jones (1978) and Carl Ditterich (1979–80), languished at the bottom of the League ladder throughout the 1970s. However, in 1971 the club started the season at the top and maintained that position until it lost to Collingwood in round 6. Melbourne was still in second place at the start of the second half of the season but within five weeks was out of the top four and finished with only two more wins and a draw. , In 1976, Melbourne missed what looked to be an almost certain finals appearance. In the final round they only needed to beat bottom side Collingwood and Footscray one place ahead needed to beat top side Carlton. They beat Collingwood at Victoria Park but an unexpected drawn game between Footscray and Carlton saw them miss fifth position. Had Footscray lost the game, Melbourne's superior percentage would have led them to a fifth spot finish. , Melbourne collected Wooden spoons in 1974 and 1978. , In 1980, the MFC finally legally separated from the MCC, becoming a public company, in an effort to attract more members and improve the club's finances. The season produced one less win than 1979 (five) but the club finished higher – ninth. It became evident that drastic action was needed for a club that had missed 16 finals series in a row the return of former star Ron Barassi was seen as the cure. When Barassi left in 1965 it was felt that he would eventually return and his arrival caused much excitement and an expectation of immediate success. , In 1981, under the chairmanship of Sir Billy Snedden , Barassi returned to Melbourne as coach and immediately appointed Robert Flower as captain. In Barassi's first year the team finished last, but this was attributed to working out who the willing players were and the club won some powerful victories in the next three seasons. There was a distinct revival during the middle of the 1984 season. The club had lost 6 of its first 7 games but won its next 6, two by large margins. After a powerful win against reigning premiers Hawthorn in round 13, elevating the club to 4th place on the ladder, Barassi's five-year plan seemed close to fruition. However, a loss the following week to eventual premiers Essendon seemed to demoralize the club and they only won two more games. , Even though during his era Brian Wilson won the Brownlow in 1982, and Peter Moore won it in 1984, Barassi's coaching was not directly able to get the club back into premiership contention, although his coaching may have set a precedent for the success that occurred 2 years after his departure. , In 1987, Melbourne made the finals under John Northey (for the first time since 1964), losing the Preliminary Final to Hawthorn on the last kick of the game after the final siren. It was also the last game played by the team captain Robert Flower . In 1988 the Demons did even better, reaching the Grand Final , only to be defeated, again, by Hawthorn. , From 1987 to 1991, Melbourne had five positive win-loss differentials in successive seasons which the club had not been able to achieve since the 1954–65 era. Thereafter things went downhill for Northey, although Jim Stynes won the Brownlow in 1991. In 1992, the club finished 11th, and Northey was replaced by Neil Balme as coach. Balme coached Melbourne into the finals in 1994, but a last game loss to Brisbane saw them drop out of the top-eight in 1995, and the club lingered at or near the bottom of the ladder for most of the 1996 season. , By 1996, the club was also in dire financial straits. The board, headed by past player Ian Ridley decided on the desperate step of a merger with Hawthorn. In the ensuing weeks, a passionate debate was fought between pro and anti-merger supporters. In the first few days of this debate, lifelong supporters Mark and Anthony Jenkins met with coterie member George Zagon to form the Demon Alternative – an anti-merger group that was to significantly impact on the plans of the incumbent board. The Demon Alternative recruited members from a wide range of areas but the two most recognised were former player and politician Brian Dixon and Rabbi Joseph Gutnick . The group quickly organised itself into a credible option for Melbourne supporters; however given the support of the AFL and other factors, when the merger issue was put to a vote, a majority of Melbourne members supported the board. In a meeting on the opposite side of town, Hawthorn members rejected their board's proposal and eventually the merger was defeated. , In the aftermath of the merger meetings, Ridley focused on a compromise with the Demons Alternative to ensure that Melbourne could continue as a viable business. His board co-opted Gutnick and Mark Jenkins onto the board and a truce of sorts was struck between all parties. In the months following the 1996 merger vote, the businessman and Joseph Gutnick became president. He put $3 million of his own money into the club, and sacked Balme as coach midway through the 1997 season. In 1998, under new coach Neale Daniher , the club spent most of the season in the top eight and beat the eventual premiers Adelaide in the Qualifying Final. Melbourne also eliminated St Kilda , but lost to North Melbourne in the Preliminary Final. In 1999 Melbourne finished in the bottom three. , In 2000 Daniher took Melbourne to the Grand Final, but the Demons were convincingly beaten by a rampaging Essendon. The members had expected a new era of success, but in 2001 it was same old story: Melbourne finished 11th. In 2002, although Melbourne again made the finals, Gutnick was voted out by the members. , In 2003, Melbourne plunged into a new crisis, winning only five games for the year and posting a $1 million loss. President Gabriel Szondy resigned and it seemed that Daniher's tenure as coach was under threat. But, continuing the recent trend, in 2004, Melbourne climbed the ladder again, winning 14 games and leading the competition, albeit for one round only, in Round 18; from there, the club lost five matches in a row, including the elimination final, to finish seventh. During the 2004 post-season, the Demons tragically lost defender Troy Broadbridge in the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami , when he was swept off Phi Phi island in Thailand . He was walking along the beach with his wife Trisha when the tsunami struck. His body was found on 3 January 2005, and brought home. A funeral was held on 20 January 2005 in recognition to the No. 20 guernsey he wore during his playing days. During the 2005 off-season, the whole team travelled to the island in which Broadbridge was killed to build a new school for those struck by the tsunami. The No.20 jumper was then rested for two years. , Melbourne started 2005 strongly, being second after Round 12, however losing momentum by Round 19 appeared unlikely to play finals, then wins against Western Bulldogs, Geelong at Geelong (where Melbourne had not won since the late 1980s), and Essendon in Round 22, placed the club seventh and a finals berth, only to lose the Elimination Final to Geelong by 55 points. , In 2006, after a slow start, Melbourne again finished the season in seventh position. After defeating St Kilda in the first Elimination Final by 18 points the season ended the following week when Fremantle beat the Demons by 28 points. Melbourne's coach Neale Daniher had become the second longest-serving coach of Melbourne, and the longest-surviving in the entire history of the VFL/AFL not to have coached a premiership side. , Season 2007 was a poor one for Melbourne. After losing their first nine games through a combination of injury and poor form, they finally broke through with wins against Adelaide and Collingwood . But, following a loss to Richmond the next week, Daniher resigned by the club, and Mark Riley was appointed as caretaker coach. The resignation of Daniher caused significant tension at the club. It was an unpopular move with the leadership group, and captain David Neitz expressed his dissatisfaction over the decision. Winning three of their remaining nine games, Melbourne avoided the wooden spoon and finished 14th. , Dean Bailey was appointed as coach for the 2008 season , but success did not follow, as Melbourne lost their first six matches, before breaking through with a record comeback win in round seven against Fremantle. They showed signs of improvement, putting up a good fight in round nine against top-of-the-ladder team Hawthorn, who were undefeated at the time. Melbourne had to wait until Round 14 for the second win. After good performances against Collingwood, Richmond, and Sydney in the preceding weeks, the Demons defeated Brisbane by a solitary point in the two team's first encounter at the MCG in nine years. , Off field, the club remained in serious turmoil. In the first sign of troubles in February 2008, CEO Steve Harris resigned. Paul Gardner addressed the media in response to comments from the club's auditors spelling disaster for the club. Gardner reiterated that the club had posted a $97,000 profit at the end of 2007.  Harris was replaced by the high profile former Wimbledon tennis champion Paul McNamee .  Despite celebrating the club's birthday with an official mid-season function at Crown Casino ,  shortly afterward chairman Paul Gardner resigned, handing the presidency to former club champion Jim Stynes who inherited a $4.5 million debt, which media pundits suggested would cripple the club.  Hawthorn 's president Jeff Kennett caused controversy with remarks about relocating the Demons to the Gold Coast ,  something which Stynes spoke against. AFL CEO Andrew Demetriou dispelled the notion that the club's future was in doubt, but admitted that Stynes' board faced a huge challenge.  Demons legend, games and goalkicking record holder, David Neitz, announced his immediate retirement due to injury on 19 May.  , Stynes wasted no time attempting to change the club's direction and eliminate debt, introducing a drive called "Debt Demolition", beginning with a call for members to sign-up.  Under Stynes' direction, the new board sacked Paul McNamee after just four months. During McNamee's tenure, he had drawn criticisms for holidaying in Wimbledon to compete in a legends match and after his sacking an attempt to lure Brisbane Lions star Jonathan Brown was also revealed.  A 5 August fundraiser raised $1.3 million. The club raised well over $3 million.  Despite the reduced debt, in November new club CEO Cameron Schwab declared that it required urgent AFL assistance to continue, requesting additional funding to its special annual distribution. In December, a fallout in negotiations between the Melbourne Cricket Club resulted in the MCC not committing an expected $2 million to the club and Schwab declared that the club's immediate future was in doubt.  , This doubt was quickly put to bed when the AFL and MCC finalised negotioations. The AFL committed $1million to the club in 2009, with the MCC matching the AFL contribution.  , By the midpoint of the 2009 season, things had improved both on and off field for Melbourne. They had secured a record number of members, re-merged with the MCC, knocked-off more debt and were starting to show some fight on field. Players such as Liam Jurrah had begun to emerge as top young talents and were catching the eye of the footballing public. However, on the eve of the Round 14 clash against West Coast, influential president Jim Stynes announced that he had cancer, this evoked a very emotional response from the footballing public and the club lifted from three embarrassing defeats the weeks before to convincingly beat West Coast in front of a passionate MCG crowd. At the end of the season, Melbourne finished 16th on the ladder and for a second year in a row won no more than four games which granted them a Priority Pick in the National Draft . Melbourne therefore had picks 1 and 2 in the draft to build on their young talent. At the end of the season fan favourites Russell Robertson , Matthew Whelan and Paul Wheatley announced that they would no longer be playing for Melbourne in 2010 and beyond. During September 2009, midfielder Brock McLean asked to be a traded and a deal involving Carlton's pick 11 in the National Draft was agreed to.  , After losing their first game against Hawthorn by 50 points and a narrow defeat to Collingwood, Melbourne strung together three consecutive wins against Adelaide, Richmond and Brisbane, making it the first time they have won three games in a row since 2006. Their 50-point win over the previously undefeated and top-of-the-table Brisbane Lions , was the upset of the round, along with Port Adelaide's shock win against St Kilda. It was the Demons' victory over Brisbane that started their freefall, winning only three more games for the season. However, losses to North Melbourne, Western Bulldogs and the poorly performing West Coast seemed to end the Dees finals dream. However, the Demons made a comeback when they narrowly defeated Port Adelaide by one point, at a home game in Darwin . Though subsequent losses to Geelong and Carlton lowered the Demons spirits, they fought a hard battle against arch-enemy Collingwood and came out with a draw. Despite showing great resilience against Collingwood, the Demons were handed two further blows with losses to Adelaide and St Kilda. The following round saw a match-up with Essendon that would decide either team's fate. Though both teams fought hard, the Demons came out on top by 19 points, keeping their finals dreams alive and moving above Essendon on the ladder. The Demons then travelled to Perth, where after a poor start, they fought back, but fell away to lose by 11 points to finals aspirant Fremantle. The next week they faced Sydney at the MCG, for the first time since 2006. Melbourne defeated Sydney by 73 points, thereby inflicting the worst loss Sydney has ever had, under premiership winning coach, Paul Roos . This was followed up with a 10-point win over the Brisbane Lions at the Gabba where the Demons had not won since 2006. The Demons finished the 2010 season in 12th position with eight and a half wins (more than double their win tallies from 2008 and 2009 combined); that could have easily been eleven if not for close results against 2010 Premiers Collingwood during the course of the year (a one-point loss in round 2 and a draw in round 12) and the Western Bulldogs (a four-point loss in round seven). , On 5 August, the club announced that Jim Stynes ' goal of wiping out the club's debt that had plagued them for so long had finally been achieved.  The event also saw Melbourne unveil its proposed new logo, which incorporates a trident, the Southern Cross , as well as the inaugural rules of Australian rules football .  , Melbourne's 2011 season started with a dramatic draw against Sydney , tying 11.18.(84) apiece after Melbourne captain Brad Green had soccered through a goal with four minutes remaining, only to see their short lead disappear by the final siren. Melbourne, heading into the match, had not won its season opening match since 2005, nor did Sydney. Round 2 saw Melbourne lose dramatically to Hawthorn by 45 points after leading by 19 at halftime. Their next two matches leading into the round 5 bye saw them defeat Brisbane by 11 points and the Gold Coast by 90 points. , However, in an eventful twist to their season, the Demons only recorded four wins between the bye in Round 5 and the second bye in Round 16, that being a record 96-point thrashing of Adelaide at the MCG in Round 7 and a convincing 33-point win over top eight side Essendon in Round 11, a record 89-point thrashing of Fremantle in Round 13, and a 27-point victory over Richmond in Round 14. , In Round 19 the Demons suffered the second-heaviest defeat in AFL/VFL history – a 186-point humiliation at the hands of Geelong . Twenty-four hours later, the Melbourne Football Club called an urgent board meeting after which coach Dean Bailey was sacked with five games remaining in the 2011 season. He left the club with only 22 wins from 83 games – a winning percentage of just over 25%, however, he was credited for rebuilding the club following the retirements of David Neitz , Adem Yze and Russell Robertson early in Bailey's coaching career. Demons assistant coach and former player Todd Viney was appointed caretaker coach for the remainder of the season, achieving 1 win the five games he coached. On 17 September 2011, Mark Neeld was appointed as senior coach for a three-year term.  , On 13 April 2012, It was announced that Webjet would take over the sponsorship of Melbourne Football Club after the controversial comments by former Melbourne sponsor, Ben Pollis, of Energy Watch.  On the field, the Demons had a poor start to the season, losing the first nine matches of the season before finally winning in Round 10, upsetting then top-placed Essendon by six points. , Despite the off-season acquisitions of several players, such as Shannon Byrnes , Tom Gillies , Chris Dawes , David Rodan and Jack Viney , the Demons underachieved in the first half of the 2013 season, managing just one win in their first 11 games. As the result of this poor start to the season, during the Demons' mid-season bye on 17 June 2013, Mark Neeld was sacked as head coach. His sacking came within weeks of the departures of senior Demons' staff members Cameron Schwab and Don McLardy . Neeld left the Demons with just five wins in 33 games coached, for a winning percentage of just 15%. Demons' senior assistant coach, Neil Craig , was appointed as the caretaker coach for the remainder of the season. Following a disastrous season finish of 17th on the ladder with two wins, on 6 September the club announced that Sydney premiership coach Paul Roos had signed a two-year deal to coach the Demons, with the option of a third year. , Paul Roos's first year in his tenure as Demon's head coach saw an improvement from their 2013 season, with the Demons doubling their win tally and their points tally, in addition to increasing their percentage and reducing the number of points conceded by the team. However, the Demons finished the season in 17th place for the second consecutive season. , On 31 July 2012, the AFL's Integrity Officer, Brett Clothier, announced a full investigation into Melbourne's 2009 season regarding allegations that the Demons had "tanked" (set out to lose) games during the season to secure a priority draft-pick that year, available to clubs winning fewer than five games. Although the press had published such allegations previously,  the investigation was prompted by specific statements from former player Brock McLean during a TV interview earlier in July 2012.  Melbourne club officials, led by board chairman Don McLardy, vigorously denied the tanking allegations. The investigation lasted 203 days and Clothier interviewed over 50 people associated with the club. The AFL released its findings on 19 February 2013. Clothier effectively cleared Melbourne of tanking, stating "there was no directive from the board and executive of the Melbourne Football Club to deliberately lose matches and that the club, coach and players did not deliberately set out to lose matches." However, the investigation did establish a 'secret' meeting, known as "The Vault", had taken place during 2009 at which club football manager Chris Connolly impressed upon then-coach Dean Bailey the desirability of procuring a priority draft pick. The AFL fined Melbourne $500,000 and suspended Connolly for one year from involvement in Melbourne's training and match-day duties and Bailey (subsequently an assistant coach of Adelaide ) for 16 weeks from coaching duties, on the basis they had contravened rule 1.6 by "acting in a manner prejudicial to the interests of the AFL." Neither Melbourne, Connolly or Bailey contested these penalties.  , The former club mascot was Ronald Deeman, or also known as Ruckle. He carried a trident , had devil horns and a pointed devil tail. , The current club mascots are Chuckie and Checkers, named after legendary coach "Checker" Hughes. They are manned by the brothers Newmarch. , The official Melbourne Football Club song is called "It's a Grand Old Flag" (sung to the tune of " You're a Grand Old Flag "). The club resurrected the original second verse in February 2011 for the 2011 season.  , Melbourne has traditionally had one of the smallest supporter bases of the Victorian teams (along with North Melbourne and the Western Bulldogs) but have improved their membership and attendances steadily since the failed Hawthorn merger in 1996, building a membership base of over 30,000 since 2009. In 2011 they set a membership record of 36,937. , * as at 22 June 2015 , The Melbourne Football Club Team of the Century was announced on 24 June 2000 at Crown Casino . The selectors were Percy Beames (former player and journalist), Lynda Carroll (club historian), Bill Guest (MFC Director), Greg Hobbs (journalist), John Mitchell (former MFC and MCC President), Linda Pearce (journalist), Dudley Phillips (supporter), Stephen Phillips (media consultant) and Mike Sheahan (journalist), with CEO John Anderson as non-voting chairman.  , Melbourne FC announced its "150 Heroes" to celebrate its 150th birthday at Crown Casino on 7 June 2008. Each player, or their closest relative, were presented with an official 150 heroes medallion.

It is based at the Arden Street Oval in the inner Melbourne suburb of North Melbourne , but plays its home matches at the nearby Docklands Stadium . , The club's mascot is a grey or red kangaroo , and its use dates from the middle of the 20th century. The club is also unofficially known as "The Shinboners", a term which dates back to its 19th-century abattoir-worker origins. The club's motto is Victoria amat curam , Latin for "Victory Demands Dedication". , , , North Melbourne Football Club originated in the year 1869, when a football team was formed for local cricketers desiring to keep fit over the winter months. One thought is that the club was connected to the St Mary's Church of England Cricket Club, now the St Mary's Anglican Church North Melbourne, whose colours – blue and white – are reflected in the North Melbourne's colours today.  The association between the St Mary's Church of England Cricket Club and the establishment of the North Melbourne Football Club is believed to have been an informal gathering to play some competitive sport. Information on the club's first ever match is limited, but it is known that it took place in Royal Park , which also served as the club's home ground until 1882. The ball used in the match was purchased by a local resident called Tom Jacks, who sold some roofing iron to pay for it. [ citation needed ] James Henry Gardiner is considered the founder of the club. He continued an active role with North Melbourne until his death in 1921. [ citation needed ] , Regular premiership matches of Australian Football commenced in Victoria in 1870. Although North Melbourne was a part of this, it was classed as a "junior club". The Australasian noted them as being "one of the best of many junior clubs". [ citation needed ] , The club continued to develop, graduating to senior ranks in 1874 finishing 4th. Along with the promotion, the club adopted its first uniform of blue and white horizontal stripes. [ citation needed ] , In 1876 North Melbourne amalgamated with Albert-park to form "North Melbourne Cum Albert Park", but by 1877 the local community had raised sufficient funds to reestablish the club, under the new name of "Hotham". [ citation needed ] , Football took a giant step forward in 1877, with the formation of Victoria's first colonial football league, the VFA. Hotham were prime movers in establishing this league and were afforded a place in light of their previous contributions to Australian Football. [ citation needed ] , The 1880s marked the emergence of the modern identity we now associate with North today. In 1882, the club amalgamated with the Hotham Cricket Club and moved into the North Melbourne Recreation Reserve (Arden St Oval), which remains the home of the club today. The joint venture was aimed at affecting improvements at the Hotham Cricket Ground, which was the name of the Reserve at the time. Four years later the club adopted the traditional uniform of blue and white vertical stripes at the insistence of the VFA, who wanted a visible contrast between Geelong's and Hotham's uniforms. The third significant development occurred in 1888 with the club returning to its original name of the North Melbourne Football Club. This followed the name of the local area reverting from Hotham to North Melbourne. , The 1880s saw the club develop a penchant for inter-colonial travel with trips to Tasmania (1881/1887) and South Australia (1889). Hotham also found itself well represented at the first ever inter-colonial representative game in 1879 with four players from the club gaining selection for Victoria. , The VFA grew to 13 senior clubs in the 1890s. Led by Geelong and Essendon, the largest clubs of the VFA formed their own break away league, the Victorian Football League (VFL), in 1896. Despite finishing 6th in 1896, North Melbourne was not invited to the breakaway competition. The main reasons for being excluded were: , North continued on in the depleted VFA, emerging as a powerhouse, finishing 2nd in 1897, 1898 and 1899. In 1903, after 34 years of competing, the club won its first premiership, defeating Richmond in the final. The club became back to back premiers in 1904 after Richmond forfeited the grand final due to the appointment of an umpire whose performance when the two teams met earlier in the year was severely criticised by Richmond players and officials.  , North merged with fellow VFA football club West Melbourne in 1907, which at the time had lost its home ground. The joint venture saw a chance of promotion, and the club applied for admission to the more prestigious VFL in 1908, but Richmond and University were admitted instead. North was kicked out of the VFA during the 1907/08 offseason as a result of applying to join the VFL,  before the local community reestablished the North Melbourne Football Club under a new committee, successfully enabling the club to play in the VFA in the 1908 season.  , The reformation of the Club necessitated a massive clean out of the team, leaving only two players remaining from the previous season. The 1910 season was marked by one of the most sensational transfers in Victorian football history, when Andy Curran masterminded the clearance of Carlton's famed "Big Four" of 'Mallee' Johnson, Fred Jinks , Charlie Hammond and Frank 'Silver' Caine to North Melbourne. These signings secured the Northerners' third premiership in 1910. , The 1912 finals series was one of the most amazing ever, with the semi-final having to be played three times, after North and Brunswick drew twice. North was eventually victorious and moved on to the final, but lost the game by a mere four points with the last kick of the day. , The next few years were punctuated by "The Invincibles". In the Northerners' most illustrious period ever, the club went undefeated from 1914 to 1919, collecting premierships in 1914, 1915 and 1918 – the league was in recess in 1916 and 1917 due to World War I . As well as this, the club won the championship in both 1915 and 1918 for finishing on top of the ladder, and accounted for VFL side St Kilda comfortably. During this period the club won 58 consecutive matches including 49 successive premiership matches, a record that has remained unmatched in Association or League history since. , Despite being rejected from the VFL in both 1896 and 1907, North persisted in trying to gain admission into the League. On 30 June 1921, North told its players it would disband and try to gain entry to the VFL by the ‘back-door’. Essendon League Football Club had lost its playing ground at East Melbourne and had decided to acquire the North Melbourne Recreation Reserve as a new playing ground. North accepted their proposal in the idea that the clubs would amalgamate. All of North's players were urged to join the Essendon League Club to help facilitate the amalgamation. The amalgamation was foiled when some members of the VFA launched a successful legal challenge.  As a result the Essendon League Club moved instead to the Essendon Oval, replacing the ground's original occupants, Essendon Association . , North was now without a playing team and the Essendon Association Club was now without a ground, so as a matter of convenience the two clubs amalgamated so they could compete in the 1922 season. As it had after the merger with West Melbourne, North once again managed to avert its destruction. , After three attempts, 29 years of waiting and numerous other applications to enter the VFL, finally North was rewarded for its persistence with admittance to the League in 1925, along with Footscray and Hawthorn . Even then, the opportunity was almost lost as the League delegates debated into the early hours of the morning on which clubs should be invited to join the intake. It was only after much deliberation that North Melbourne's name was eventually substituted for Prahran's making North "the lucky side" of the invitees that included Footscray and Hawthorn. North Melbourne was forced to change its uniform to avoid a clash when it joined the VFL. , North Melbourne were cellar dwellers for its first twenty-five years of VFL membership and struggled to win matches in the superior VFL competition, but by the late 1940s had developed a strong list and significant supporter base. In 1949 North secured the VFL Minor Premiership, finishing top of the ladder at the end of the home-and-away season with 14 wins and 5 losses. They failed to make the Grand Final that year (eventually won by Essendon ), but in 1950 they did reach the final, defeated by a more efficient Essendon. It was in this year that the club adopted the "Kangaroos" mascot.  , In February 1965, North Melbourne moved its playing and training base from the Arden Street Oval to Coburg Oval , signing a seven year lease with the City of Coburg  after initially negotiating long-term leases for up to 40 years.  The club came to an arrangement to merge with the VFA's Coburg Football Club , whom it was displacing from the ground;  fourteen Coburg committeemen joined the North Melbourne committee, but the merger was never completed after Coburg established a rival committee which remained loyal to the VFA.  The lease at Coburg lasted only eight months; the Coburg council was hesitant to build a new grandstand without the security of a long-term lease, and neither party made the returns they expected, so it was terminated by mutual agreement in September 1965 and North Melbourne returned to the Arden Street Oval.   , Onfield, the 1950s and 1960s were lean years for North Melbourne, though the club did secure two consecutive Night Premierships in 1965 and 1966. Allen Aylett was a brilliant player in the late 1950s and early 1960s (and captain between 1961 and 1964), as was Noel Teasdale , who lost the Brownlow Medal on a countback in 1965 (he was later awarded a retrospective medal when the counting system was amended). , In the late 1960s, under the leadership of Allen Aylett , North Melbourne began its climb to supremacy. As part of a major recruitment drive North secured the services of several big name stars including Barry Davis from Essendon and Doug Wade ( Geelong ), John Rantall (South Melbourne), Barry Cable ( Perth ). In a major coup, the great Ron Barassi was appointed coach in 1973. Barrassi reversed the club's playing fortunes, taking an unremarkable team that was once regarded as the traditional cellar dwellers of the competition, through a golden era of success that transformed North into one of the powerhouses of the VFL. Barassi took North to a Grand Final (defeated by Richmond ) in 1974 and brought success in his 1975 and 1977 seasons. North made five consecutive Grand Finals from 1974–1978)  :209 and defeated Norwood in the 1975 national championship to be declared Champions of Australia . , In 1973 and 1974, North's wingman Keith Greig won consecutive Brownlow Medals ; forward Malcolm Blight then won the award in 1978. Doug Wade won the Coleman medal in 1974 with his 103 goals for the season. , Barassi remained team coach until 1980, but only a Night Premiership in that year was to result from his last years at Arden Street . North then entered another period of decline, though Malcolm Blight kicked 103 goals to take out the Coleman medal in 1982, and another Brownlow win came through the talented Ross Glendinning in 1983. In that year, North Melbourne won a third Minor Premiership with 16 wins and 6 losses for the season, but failed to make the Grand Final. , The capable coaching of John Kennedy aside, the 1980s and early 1990s were lean years for the Kangaroos. However, the rebuilding of the club was taking place. The Krakouer brothers (Jim and Phil) brought a spark into the side and lifted many hopes for North supporters and the excitement to the general football public. The innovative idea of night games was instigated by the club and meeting the challenges, the club survived. One major highlight was the recruitment of forward John Longmire in 1989, who topped the club goalkicking over five consecutive seasons (1990–1994) and won the Coleman medal in 1990 with 98 goals. At the beginning of the 1993 season, in a dramatic and controversial move, the board of the club sacked coach and long-time player Wayne Schimmelbusch , and appointed Denis Pagan in his place. Results were immediate, as North reached the finals for the first time in nearly a decade. , Pagan was instrumental in appointing young centre half-forward Wayne Carey as the club's youngest-ever captain. Carey had been recruited at the same time as Longmire , but taken longer to develop as a player. Over the next nine seasons, Carey came to be regarded as the standout player in the league, and was known as 'the King'. , North Melbourne became a powerhouse through the 1990s under Pagan and Carey, and finished in the top four from 1994 until 2000. After being eliminated in the preliminary finals in 1994 and 1995, North went on to defeat the Sydney Swans in the 1996 Grand Final to take out the club's third premiership, and the gold centenary AFL cup; Glenn Archer won the Norm Smith Medal . The club was again eliminated in the preliminary final in 1997. In 1998, as the club won both the pre-season Ansett Cup and topped the ladder with 16 wins and 6 losses, but went on to lose the 1998 Grand Final to Adelaide , not helped by an inaccurate goalkicking performance of 8.22 (70) to Adelaide's 15.15 (105). In 1999, the Kangaroos finished in second position on the ladder, and went on to defeat Carlton in the Grand Final, winning the club's fourth VFL/AFL premiership; former Sydney midfielder Shannon Grant taking out the Norm Smith Medal . The club was eliminated in the preliminary finals in 2000 against Melbourne. , In 1996, the club was in advanced talks with the Fitzroy Football Club , which was in a terminal financial condition, to a merger between the two clubs; however, Fitzroy ultimately merged with the Brisbane Bears instead. , Seeking new markets and greater financial security in an increasingly corporatized AFL environment, the title "North Melbourne" was officially dropped from the logo in 1999, from which time the team played only as the "Kangaroos". During the successful 1999 season, North Melbourne played home games in Sydney with a view of becoming a second team in New South Wales ; however, the experiment was not successful, with crowds averaging only 12,000. , The 21st century did not begin well for North Melbourne. Its decade-long onfield potency was in decline, questions were raised about its financial position and long-term sustainability. Furthermore, three of the people most important to the club's success in the 1990s left the club under acrimonious circumstances: CEO Greg Miller left the club, captain Wayne Carey left prior to the 2002 season following an extramarital affair with the wife of team-mate and vice captain Anthony Stevens , coach Denis Pagan was lured to Carlton at the end of 2002. Pagan was replaced by 1996 premiership player Dean Laidley , who had previously been an Assistant Coach at Collingwood from 1999 until the end of season 2002. , On a post-season holiday, several players were caught in the 2002 Bali bombing terrorist attack. Defender and sometime forward Jason McCartney suffered severe burns in the incident. He memorably played one final game for the club, on 6 June 2003 against Richmond , and he set up the winning goal with seconds remaining. He retired immediately after the game. , Onfield, the club reached the elimination finals in 2002 and 2005, but otherwise failed to reach the finals from 2001 until 2006. After two seasons of finals, North Melbourne dropped to 13th in 2009, and coach Dean Laidley, was replaced by ex-Brisbane Lions premiership player and Collingwood assistant coach Brad Scott . A $15M redevelopment of the Arden Street, which had started in 2006, was completed in 2009, giving the club top-class training facilities. North Melbourne struggled in its first two years under Scott, finishing 9th in both 2010 and 2011. In 2012, the club returned to the finals for the first time since 2008, finishing the season in 8th place but would go down to the West Coast Eagles by 96 points in the elimination final. In 2012, the club began a three-year deal to play two games each year at Blundstone Arena in Hobart, Tasmania . The club finished 10th in 2013 in a season full of close losses. Nick Dal Santo signed with the club at the end of the 2013 season as a restricted free agent. , In 2014, North Melbourne finished 6th at the end of the home and away season and reached 40,000 members for the first time in the club's history.  In September, North Melbourne went on to defeat Essendon by 12 points in the 2nd Elimination Final, only taking the lead in the last quarter. The following week, North Melbourne beat Geelong in the 2nd Semi Final by 6 points advancing them through to their first Preliminary Final since 2007. They lost to Sydney by 71 points. , The club was widely known as the 'Shinboners' for much of their early history. The origins of this nickname are unknown but it may have had something to do with the club's reputation for targeting the shinbones of opposition players, or to do with local butchers who showed their support for North by dressing up beef leg-bones in the club colours. By 1926, the club was known as the 'Blue Birds' but this nickname did not last. It was Phonse Tobin, North president from 1953–56, who oversaw the club adopting the Kangaroos emblem in 1954; Tobin found the image of a shinbone unsavoury and wanted the club to have a mascot it could show with pride. In selecting a new name, he wanted something characteristically Australian and got inspiration from a giant Kangaroo he saw on display outside a city store. , The official name of the club is North Melbourne, but the club has gone under several other aliases over the years. The club was originally founded as the 'North Melbourne Football Club', but changed to 'North Melbourne cum Albert Park' after merging with Albert Park in 1876. Following the reformation of the club in 1877, it was known as the 'Hotham Football Club' but later retook the name 'North Melbourne' in 1888. In 1998 the club proposed changing its name to the 'Northern Kangaroos', but it was rejected by the AFL. Between 1999 and 2007, the club traded without much success as 'The Kangaroos' in a bid to increase its appeal nationally; this decision was reversed at the end of 2007, and the club has once again reverted to the name 'North Melbourne'. , North Melbourne's guernsey since entering the VFL in 1925 has consisted of white and royal blue vertical stripes. The guernsey is predominantly white. , The current clash guernsey is a reversed version of the home strip, with blue stripes where the white stripes traditionally are placed and vice versa; as such, the clash strip is predominantly royal blue, rather than predominantly white, creating a much darker design. , "Join in the Chorus" is the official anthem of the North Melbourne Football Club. It is sung to the tune of a Scottish folk song "A Wee Deoch an Doris", from around 1911.  , The famed song is generally sung, in accordance to common football tradition, after a victory. It is also played before every match. , "Join in the Chorus" is believed to be the oldest club anthem of any AFL club, and has been associated with North from its early VFA days. The preamble of the song originates from a score of a Theatre Musical called 'Australia: Heart to Heart and Hand to Hand" written by Toso Taylor in the 1890s in pre-federation Australia.  The second verse is unknown in origin and was presumably added later by members of the North Melbourne Football Club when the song was chosen as the club theme. The chorus was appropriated from a song written and performed by Scottish musician Harry Lauder . The recording currently used by the club was performed by the Fable Singers in April 1972 and only includes the choruses.  , The song has a strong Victorian heritage, and has been traditionally sung by the Victorian State Football and Victorian Cricket teams respectively. The lyrics have occasionally been changed, including updating the year in the song ( e.g. North Melbourne will be premiers in 1993 ), or to remove the words "North Melbourne" during the period when the club was competing as 'Kangaroos'. , For the 2015 premiership season, You Am I lead singer Tim Rogers , a fan of North Melbourne, announced he will assist in an updated version of the club song including the 2 versus. This version is only played at North home games as they run out onto the ground. , The term "Shinboner spirit" is often used to refer to camaraderie and determination of players or members of the North Melbourne Football Club. The term persists to the modern day, despite North Melbourne having switched its official nickname from Shinboners to Kangaroos in the 1950s. , Because it relates to the club's original nickname, Shinboner spirit is often associated with the complete history of the club. In 2005, to celebrate the club's 80th anniversary of senior competition in the VFL and the thirtieth anniversary of the first VFL premiership, the Kangaroos held a "Shinboner Spirit" gala event, attended by almost the entire surviving playing list. In the awards ceremony, the key Shinboners of the past eighty years were acknowledged, and Glenn Archer was named the "Shinboner of the Century". , The North Melbourne Football Club is non a profit organisation limited by guarantee. Members of the club serve as the guarantees of capital, and have full voting rights at AGMs to elect directors to the club's board. , The club's board compromises nine directors with each director serving a 3-year term before their position is put up for re-election at an AGM. Only one-third of the board is contested at each AGM due to the rolling structure of the terms of the directors. This structure safeguards the entire board from being ousted at a single AGM, and has made North Melbourne immune to a lot of the in house fighting witnessed at other AFL football clubs. The board governs the club as well as selecting a chairman to head the club through a majority vote of directors. , North Melbourne is unique in its structure, because from 1986 to 2006 the club was privately owned and limited by shares. The club was floated in 1986 through a membership vote led by then chairman Bob Ansett. At the meeting, members were encouraged to buy into the club by purchasing shares. The float ended up raising over $3 million and helped to keep the club solvent through the next decade. , In 1991, the John Elliott -led Carlton Football Club attempted a hostile take over North Melbourne by purchasing a large parcel of shares formerly owned by Bob Ansett. The Blues acquired 20 per cent of the capital but that stake was eventually bought back by John Magowan, the former head of Merrill Lynch Australia, in 2001. The resulting melodrama saw the formation of B-Class shareholders who had the effective power of veto over any attempt to merge or relocate the club. , Further takeover attempts were made in the first decade of the 21st century by the Southport Sharks . Then chairman Allan Aylett knocked back a proposal from the Sharks that would have seen them gain a majority stake in the club in exchange for an injection of capital. In early 2006, another proposal from Sharks to underwrite Kangaroos games on the Gold Coast, in exchange for a slice of the shareholder structure at the club was knocked back after AFL intervention. , Due to an Australian Tax Office ruling in 2006, the club proposed a shareholder restructure that would have seen the B Class shareholders power reduced significantly and some voting rights returned to members. This was done to avoid extraordinary taxes being placed on the club, but the move was blocked in December by Bob Ansett and his proxies who feared that the restructure would make the club vulnerable to further takeover bids. , On 28 February 2007, another meeting was called to resolve the shareholder issue, and a motion was passed that would return see some voting rights return to members and stop any future tax increments. , In April 2007 it was revealed the AFL was attempting to buy out the shareholders of the club in a bid to gain full ownership, and force a relocation of the club to the Gold Coast. , During October 2007, a group called We Are North Melbourne emerged and launched a public campaign, calling for ordinary members to be given the final say on the relocation issue. While the group became synonymous with the push to keep the club in Melbourne, its first priority was to see the club's shareholder structure wound-up and control returned to ordinary members. , North Melbourne reverted to public company in November 2008. A moratorium was passed at an extraordinary general meeting that will allow James Brayshaw's board to serve unopposed until 2010, so as to allow his ticket the maximum time to enact their policies to make the North Melbourne Football Club financially viable. , In 2014 The North Melbourne Football club achieved a record membership of 40,092 members including 4,145 from Tasmania. The figure is a 78% increase since 2007 when the club faced possible relocation. , In 1985, North Melbourne pioneered the concept of playing football on Friday nights. Since then, North Melbourne has played the most Friday night games of any AFL club. [ citation needed ] , Friday night matches later became the most lucrative timeslot for televised games, and North Melbourne's relatively low supporter base resulted in less Friday night matches. Between 2010 and 2014, North Melbourne had hosted an annual Friday night match against Carlton in recognition of its pioneering role in the concept.  , North Melbourne has a strong history of supporting Aboriginal footballers and fostering Aboriginal talent in the VFL and AFL. The first indigenous footballer to play for the club was Percy Johnson in the 1950s, and was followed by other fan favorites like Bertie Johnson, Barry Cable and the Krakouer brothers in the following decades.  , The following is a list of Indigenous footballers to have played senior football at the club:   , †: Aboriginality uncertain , The following footballers who were killed in action during the World Wars played senior football for North Melbourne. , Essendon (main) – North and Essendon have a chequered history that dates back to the late 19th century; firstly in 1896, Essendon had North excluded from the VFL because both clubs drew supporters from the same area. North supporters have long been bitter with Essendon for excluding them from the VFL, and have blamed that for their small supporter base in comparison to Essendon's. North's first VFL Grand Final was against Essendon in 1950 . The rivalry was reignited in the 90s; in 1998, following comments by Essendon coach labelling Kangaroos executives Greg Miller and Mark Dawson "marshmallows", a reference to their softness, North supporters threw marshmallows at Sheedy after the opening Qualifying Final.  , Hawthorn – North and Hawthorn have a fierce rivalry that dates back to the 1970s when they played off against each other in three Grand Finals in the space of four years. From 1974 to 1978 the two clubs played against each other in ten finals, and took each other on for the Australian Championship in Adelaide in 1976. During the 1980s Hawthorn dominated North, and during the 90s the results were reversed with North dominating Hawthorn. , Collingwood – North and Collingwood have a small kind of rivalry between them. As they drew in the 1977 Grand Final , which North went on to win in the replay by 27 points.  , Carlton – Although not known for their on-field rivalry, North Melbourne and Carlton have endured a tumultuous off-field relationship. In 1965, North Melbourne moved to the Coburg City Oval , which Carlton opposed as an invasion of its own territory: Coburg was located within Carlton's recruiting zone, and was home to about of quarter of Carlton's members at the time.  Later, after North Melbourne was listed on the stock market in 1987, Carlton bought 20% of the shares to become part-owner of the rival club. In 1988 there was a merger proposal put to North Melbourne, that was rejected.  , Port Adelaide - Port Adelaide often refer to North Melbourne as the "bogey side"   and as of 2014, North lead 21-8.  Their most recent was in round 3 2014, where North came from behind to win by 7 points. This was Port's only loss in the first 12 rounds of 2014 . , Port Adelaide lost their first finals appearance to North Melbourne in 1999 in the qualifying final, and in Port's premiership year of 2004 , North beat Port by 92 points, however, Port beat North Melbourne in the 2007 Preliminary Final by 87 points. , At a special function in August 2001 the North Melbourne Team of the Century was announced. There was no minimum number of games set for selection. Wayne Carey was named as captain and Denis Pagan as coach. The selection panel was Geoff Poulter (journalist), Father Gerard Dowling (club historian), Keith McKenzie (former coach), Lloyd Holyoak (former president), Max Ritchie (former player and chairman of selectors) and Greg Miller (chief executive). , , On 18 March 2005, the North Melbourne football club held a special gala dinner entitled the "North Story" to celebrate the 80th anniversary of North's admission to the VFL, and the 30th anniversary of the club's first VFL premiership. Over 3500 people attended the historic event held at the Royal Exhibition Building , including almost all surviving North Melbourne players. Glenn Archer was voted the Shinboner of the Century by his peers as the player who most represents the 'Shinboner Spirit'. The following players were voted 'Shinboners' of their era: , Head coach , Assistant coaches , ,  The Port Adelaide Football Club is a professional Australian rules football club based in Alberton , South Australia, which plays in the Australian Football League (AFL) (in which they are known as the Power ) and the South Australian National Football League (SANFL) (in which they are known as the Magpies ).  Port Adelaide is the older of the two clubs in South Australia playing in the AFL and the 5th oldest club playing in the Australian Football League . Since the club's first game on May 24, 1870, it has won 36 SANFL premierships, including six in a row. The club also won the Champions of Australia competition on a record four occasions.   , From its foundation in 1870 to 1996, the Port Adelaide Football Club competed in the SANFL as the Magpies. In 1997, the club joined the Australian Football League—the only pre-existing non-Victorian club to have done so. On entry, Port Adelaide adopted a new nickname, "The Power", along with the colour teal. Since joining the AFL, Port Adelaide have added the 2004 AFL Grand Final to their premiership wins. , , , The Port Adelaide Football Club was established on 12 May 1870 as part of a joint Australian football and cricket club with the first training session taking place two days later.  It played its first match against a team called the "Young Australians" on 24 May 1870 at Buck's Flat, a property owned by club president John Hart in Glanville . Football in South Australia at this stage was yet to be organised by a single body and as a result there were several sets of rules in use across the state. The last game of the club's first season was played in front of a crowd of 600 people with The Port Artillery Band playing live music throughout the October afternoon and John Wald the only player to score a major.  , Port Adelaide played approximately 44 games at Glanville Hall Estate between 1870 and 1879 with 16 SAFA premiership matches during the first three years of the organised state competition. The largest attendance at the ground was approximately 1,000 spectators who witnessed the home side lose to Norwood by 2 goals.  , In 1877 Port Adelaide joined seven other local clubs and formed the South Australian Football Association , the first organisation of its type in Australia.  It competed its first few seasons wearing a rose pink outfit with white knickerbockers.  In 1878 the club hosted its first game against the recently established Norwood Football Club with the visitors winning 1-0. A rivalry between these clubs would soon develop into one of the fiercest in Australian sport .  , In 1880, the club moved from Glanville Hall Estate to Alberton Oval which, except for the 1975 and 1976 seasons, has been its base ever since. For the first time in 1881 the club played an interstate club, which was the Carlton Football Club , at Adelaide Oval. Later in that year the club also traveled to Victoria and played its first game outside South Australian boarders against Sale Football Club .  During Round 4 of the 1882 SAFA season Port Adelaide overcame Norwood for the first time after nine previous attempts winning by 1 goal at Adelaide Oval . In 1884 Port Adelaide would win its first SAFA premiership bringing to an end Norwood's run of six consecutive premierships. , On 25 May 1885 Port Adelaide played two of its first ever games at the MCG against the South Melbourne and Melbourne Football Club losing to the home sides by 10 behinds and three goals respectively.  Immense interest led into the 1887 Round 8 meeting between Port Adelaide and Norwood as to the previous two matches between the clubs had ended in draws. Norwood won the match in front of a then-record 11,000 spectators at Adelaide Oval .  During 1889 the club played against the Richmond Football Club at Punt Road Oval , with the Port Adelaide side prevailing by one goal.  The 1889 SAFA season ended with Port Adelaide and Norwood level at the top of the premiership ladder, leading to the staging of a championship decider. This would be the first Grand Final in one of the premier Australian football leagues. Norwood went on to defeat Port Adelaide in the 1889 SAFA Grand Final by two goals in front of 11,000 at Adelaide Oval . , Port Adelaide won its second SAFA premiership in 1890 and would go on to be crowned " Champions of Australia " for the first time after defeating VFA premiers South Melbourne . During the 1890s Australia was affected by a severe depression and many of Port Adelaide's working class players were forced to move interstate to find work. This translated into poor results on the field. In 1896, with the club in crisis after finishing the season last, the club committee met with the aim of revitalising the club. Australian football historian John Devaney summarised the means by which the club pursued this goal as "the conscious and deliberate cultivation by both the committee and the team's on field leaders of a revitalised club spirit, whereby playing for Port Adelaide became a genuine source of pride".  It had immediate results and in 1897 Port Adelaide won a third premiership finishing the season with a record of 14-2-1 with a scoring record two and a half times its conceded total. This is one of only four occurrences since 1877 that the team that finished last won a premiership the following year. To top off the 1897 season for the club, Stan Malin won Port Adelaide's first Magarey Medal in 1899. , The club had various nicknames during the 19th century including the Cockledivers, the Seaside Men, the Seasiders and the Magentas. In 1900, Port finished bottom in the six-team competition, which it has not done in any senior league since. Port Adelaide's champion players from this era include Harold Phillips , Ken and John McKenzie, Archibald Hosie , Charlie Fry and Stan Malin .  , In 1902, Port Adelaide took the field in black and white guernseys for the first time after it was having trouble finding appropriate and affordable dyes that would last for its blue and magenta guernseys.  , Port Adelaide was now being referred to as "the Magpies" and would have instant success in the black and white wharf pylon guernsey defeating North Adelaide by 28 points at Alberton Oval in its new guise. However the first year in the new guernsey would also be a controversial year for the club. After finishing the 1902 SAFA season a game clear on top of the ladder with a scoring ratio of approximately 2-1, the club found itself disqualified during the finals by the SAFL after a game schedlued between the club and South Adelaide was abandoned after a dispute regarding the use of Mr Kneebone as an umpire, who was not certified by the football association at the beginning of the year as an umpire. Port Adelaide considered that Mr Kneebone would not be impartial and refused to play.  The 1902 SAFA premiership would subsequently be awarded to North Adelaide after they defeated South Adelaide in the Grand Final a week later.  Port Adelaide offered to play North Adelaide in a premiership deciding match, but the association refused.  This point in time marked the beginning of a halcyon era for the club participating in 12 Grand Final appearances in the next 13 seasons setting the foundations for the club to win 31 premierships in the newly adopted black and white wharf pylon guernsey over a period of 92 years until its entrance into the AFL in 1997. , The first premiership after the dispute came the following year when Port Adelaide defeated South Adelaide 6.6 (42) to 5.5 (35) in the 1903 SAFA Challenge Final. A further premiership came in 1906 when Port defeated North Adelaide 8.12 (60) to 5.9 (39) in the year's Grand Final. During the early stages of the 1907 season, Port Adelaide travelled to Sydney to play a combination of the cities best players. The game was marketed as 'Port Adelaide vs. Sydney' with the harbour city side taking the honours 8.9 (57) to 5.14 (44).  Port Adelaide won the SAFL premiership in 1910 defeating Sturt 8.12 (60) to 5.11 (41) in the Grand Final. The club would go on to defeat Collingwood for the 1910 Championship of Australia title. , The East Fremantle Football Club had toured South Australia in 1909 and embarrassed Port Adelaide 12.13 (85) to 8.16 (64) in what was the two clubs' first encounter. During the 1910 post season, seeking revenge, Port Adelaide travelled to Western Australia and evened the ledger scoring 6.10 (46) to beat East Fremantle's 5.4 (34). To conclude this trip Port Adelaide played a combination of some of the Western Australian Football League 's best players and achieved a remarkable victory scoring 6.17 (53) to 6.12 (48), with Sampson Hosking named best on ground.  Along with beating the premiers from South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia in 1910, Port Adelaide also invited North Broken Hill, the premier team of New South Wales, to a game at Adelaide Oval. Port Would win this game 14.20 (104) to 5.5 (35).  , The following two seasons for Port Adelaide would be frustrating dropping only one game during the 1911 minor round and going undefeated the following year in 1912 only to be knocked out of contention by West Adelaide both times, the second of these encounters in front of a pre war South Australian record crowd of 28,500. During the 1912 preseason, Port Adelaide travelled to Tasmania and took on a combination of players from various Tasmanian Football League sides. The game would prove to be very competitive with Port Adelaide defeating the TFL combination 7.13 (55) to 6.6 (42).  , During the 1913 preseason, Port Adelaide travelled back to Western Australia to play East Fremantle again with the local side winning for a second time 6.6 (42) to 4.12 (36). Despite this inauspicious preseason the club would break through in 1913, dropping only two games during the minor round and eventually defeating North Adelaide 7.12 (54) to 5.10 (40) for the SAFL premiership and Fitzroy 13.16 (94) to 4.7 (31) for the 1913 Championship of Australia . , The 1914 season is widely regarded as the club's best season with Port Adelaide achieving the distinction of going through the entire year without losing a single match. It is won its fourteen SAFL games by an average margin of 49 points. The 1914 SAFL Grand Final is notable as Port Adelaide held North Adelaide to a single goal for the match 13.15 (93) to 1.8 (14), a feat that would be repeated in 1989. The club would then meet VFL premiers Carlton on Adelaide Oval , defeating the V ictorian club 9.16 (70) to 5.6 (36) to claim a record fourth Championship of Australia title . At the end of 1914 season the SAFL put together a combined team from the six other SAFL clubs to play Port Adelaide to no avail with the now dubbed "Invincibles" winning 14.14 (98) to South Australia's 5.10 (40). , Champion players of this era included Frank Hansen , Harold Oliver , Angelo Congear and Sampson Hosking . The latter three of those player mentioned have the unique distinction of playing in three Championships of Australia together as well all taking part in South Australia's first victorious Australian National Football Carnival in 1911 .  , The onset of World War I was causing players to start taking up arms in 1915 and forced the SAFL to be suspended for three years bringing an abrupt halt to Port Adelaide's dominance. , During World War I the club lost three players—William Boon, Joseph Watson and Albert Chaplin—to the war. A scaled-back competition referred to as the 'Patriotic League' was organised during wartime in which Port Adelaide won the 1916 and 1917 instalments. After World War I, Harold Oliver , arguably the state's best player, was close to retiring from league football playing only 1 game in 1919 and 8 in 1920. However keen supporters of the Port Adelaide Football Club hoping to replicate the club's pre-war success raised funds and bought him a motorbike so he could commute from Berri where he eventually settled on his own block as a fruit grower for the 1921 season.  During the 1921 season Oliver captained the club to the 1921 SAFL premiership, winning his fourth in the process. In 1922 after playing only 5 league matches for the season his football career came to an end due to commitments regarding his farm at Berri and disputes regarding game compensation. His contract termination meant he was paid ₤76 of ₤100 pounds for the season making him one the highest-paid footballers of the era.  Shortly afterwards,most of Port Adelaide's champion players from before the war started to retire from the league football and the clubs performances subsequently declined.  , In 1926 Port Adelaide captain Clifford Keal began a tradition that has continued to this day by wearing the number one. In 1928, John Eden became Port Adelaide's first Indigenous player at league level. John's brother Drozena would debut the following year and would eventually become vice captain of the club.  As was the case in the 1890s, the depression of the early 1930s hit the club hard with players moving interstate to secure employment.  , However, by the late 1930s, the economy and Port Adelaide's form both recovered and after two narrow grand final losses in 1934 and 1935 the club won premierships in 1936, 1937 and 1939. During the 1939 preseason, Port Adelaide sent a team over to Perth for a third time, to play a combination of the Goldfield League and WAFL.  Port Adelaide would falter to both combinations. The 1939 SANFL season was notable as it was the club's last pre-war premiership. During the year Bob Quinn , in his third year as a player for the club, coached the team its Grand Final victory over neighbours West Torrens . Shortly after the victory during a work day, as so many other young men were doing, Bob Quinn quietly left work during a lunch-break to enlisted for military service.  Many other Port Adelaide players also enlisted for service during this time. In 1941 Port Adelaide suffered its first player casualties from war since World War I with Lloyd Rudd and Jack Wade both killed on the Allies' front in France. Four more players would be killed through the war: Maxwell Carmichael, George Quinn, Christopher Johnston and Halcombe Brock.   , Just as had happened in 1914, the SANFL was hit hard by player losses in World War II. Due to a lack of players the league's eight teams were reduced to four with Port Adelaide merging with nearby West Torrens Football Club from 1942 to 1944. The joint club would play in all three Grand Finals during this period, winning the 1942 instalment but losing the 1943 and 1944 editions to the Norwood-North Adelaide combination. Normal competition resumed in 1945 and after finishing his military service Haydn Bunton Sr. , now a triple Brownlow and Sandover medallist, joined the club for his final season.  However, despite this addition Port Adelaide was unable to regain its pre-war success and played in only one grand final for the rest of the 1940s. , At the end of the 1949 SANFL season , having missed two finals series in a row, the Port Adelaide Football Club had become desperate to improve its on-field performances. The club's committee subsequently sought out a coach that could win the club its next premiership. , Eventually a decision was made which would influence the next 50 years of the Port Adelaide Football Club with Foster Neil Williams , a brilliant rover from West Adelaide , being appointed captain-coach of the club. Williams brought to the club a new coaching style based on success at any cost which was succinctly encapsulated in the legendary club creed he eventually wrote in 1962. During his second season as coach in 1951, Williams led Port to their first official premiership (excluding World War II competition) for 9 seasons, defeating North Adelaide by 11 points. At the end of the 1951 season the VFL premiers Geelong visited South Australia to play the local premiers Port Adelaide on Adelaide Oval . Geelong won the match 8.14 (62) to 6.18 (54) in front of 25,000 people.  The following year Port Adelaide would finish the 1952 SANFL home and away season in second spot, two points behind eventual premier North Adelaide. Their season would come to an end after being knocked out of the finals by rival Norwood during a preliminary final at Adelaide Oval. Port Adelaide would make the Grand Final again in 1953 against local rivals West Torrens in what would be the Eagles last appearance before merging with Woodville. West Torrens would disappoint Port Adelaide, winning the 1953 premiership by 7 points. Port Adelaide's run of disappointment from the 1952 and 1953 seasons would prove to be short lived with the club subsequently going on to win a national record six Grand Finals in a row from 1954 to 1959. The club had a win-loss-draw record of 105-16-1 (86%) over the six-year period. , Williams left as coach in 1958 to take a break from the game. Geof Motley took over the captain-coaching role at the club to win the 1959 premiership, a national record sixth consecutive Grand Final victory. Port Adelaide's hope of winning 7 consecutive premierships would be brought to an end by Norwood during the 1960 SANFL preliminary final, with the redlegs prevailing by 27 points. For the following two seasons Port Adelaide would finish third. , Fos Williams returned in 1962 and Port Adelaide won three of the next four premierships taking his personal tally to nine and the clubs record to 10 of the last 15 premierships. The 1965 premiership, the last that Williams coached, was played in front of 62,543 people, the largest ever crowd at Adelaide Oval . In that game Port Adelaide defeat Sturt 12.8 (80) to 12.5 (77). After the 1965 SANFL Grand Final , Port Adelaide would be particularly frustrated by the dominance of Sturt , which won seven premierships over this period under the leadership of Jack Oatey . In all, despite playing in 6 of the next 10 grand finals, Port Adelaide would fail to win a premiership until 1977. Champion players introduced in this era include John Cahill , Peter Woite , Dave Boyd , Geof Motley and Russell Ebert .  , One of Port Adelaide's finest players during the Fos Williams era was John Cahill . He eventually became William's protégé and ultimately took over as coach in 1974. Cahill coached in the Williams style and was, if anything, even more aggressive. In 1975 an off-field dispute between the Port Adelaide City Council and the SANFL over the use of Alberton Oval forced Port Adelaide to move its home matches to Adelaide Oval for two seasons. In 1976 Port Adelaide completely dominated the minor round, winning 17 of the 21 matches. Cahill would subsequently take Port Adelaide to its first Grand Final under his leadership against Sturt with an official attendance of 66,897, a record which still stands for the SANFL. The actual crowd was estimated at 80,000, much bigger than the official figure as the SANFL ran out of tickets early and were forced to shut the gates 90 minutes before the bounce as people were being crushed on entry.  The police were subsequently forced to allow spectators to sit along the fence.  Despite being labelled "too old and too slow" by commentators, Sturt overwhelmed Port Adelaide to win by 41 points. The State Government enforced tighter regulations on the SANFL after this game to ensure crowd safety. In 1977 the council dispute regarding Alberton Oval was eventually resolved with the club moving back to its home ground. The 1977 premiership was notable as it broke an 11-year drought, the longest since Port Adelaide began competing in an organised football competition. A side story to the 1977 premiership was Randall Gerlach, the clubs leading goal kicker the year prior, who made the decision to play throughout 1977 against his doctors advice regarding a chronic kidney condition that would prematurely end his career at age 24. Gerlach played his 100th game during the year and played in the 1977 Grand Final but his kidneys would shut down and cause him to endure dialysis and kidney transplants.  The club would go on to win four of the next five seasons from 1977 to 1981. , The 1980 SANFL season was Port Adelaide's most dominant since 1914 . The club won the Stanley H. Lewis Memorial Trophy as the best club in all SANFL divisions with both its League and reserve sides winning their respective premierships and all levels of the club playing finals. Russell Ebert won his record 4th Magarey Medal . Tim Evans set the league goal kicking record of 146 goals in a season. The club provided seven players to the state league team ( Ebert , Evans , Cunningham , Phillips , Williams , Giles and Faletic ). The club set a new record for most points scored during the whole season at 3,421 whilst also having the best defence conceding only 1,851 points for an end of season percentage of 184.82%. Overall Port Adelaide lost 2 games from 24 for the year. , During the 1981 preseason, Port Adelaide, reigning SANFL premiers invited reigning VFL premiers Richmond to a game at Alberton Oval to which they accepted. Although the game was nothing more than an exhibition match both teams fielded very strong teams. The match proved to be a thriller with Richmond holding off a late Port Adelaide charge to win by a single point, 14.13 (97) to 13.20 (98).  Port Adelaide would go on to defeat the local Glenelg Tigers by 51 points for the 1981 SANFL premiership.  The following year Port Adelaide would lose to Glenelg by 1 point in the SANFL preliminary final in what would be John Cahill's last game coaching the club until 1988. , In 1983 Russell Ebert took on the coaching role at Port Adelaide when Cahill left Port Adelaide to coach Collingwood for two seasons. This period saw Port Adelaide's form drop failing to reach the grand final. The period was also marked by the rise of the VFL as the premier football competition in the country. Many SANFL players were moving to the VFL for the larger salaries on offer. , In 1982 the SANFL approached the VFL in regards to entering a composite side in their league, an action also taken by East Perth and the Norwood Football Club . These approaches were ignored by the VFL at the time.  The Port Adelaide Football Club's annual report from late 1982 showed that the failure of these attempts significantly impacted the club's understanding of its future.  From this point in time onwards Port Adelaide restructured the club in regards to economics, public relations and on-field performance for an attempt to enter the league in 1990. There was genuine feeling that failure to do this would result in the club ceasing to exist in the future.  , John Cahill returned as coach at the end of the 1987 SANFL season. , Talk of a side from South Australia entering the VFL was fast tracked in 1987 when a team from Western Australia, the West Coast Eagles , and a team from Brisbane , the Brisbane Bears joined the VFL. This left South Australia as the only mainland state in Australia without a team in an increasingly national competition. During the 1988 season, one of Fos Williams sons, Anthony, was tragically killed in a building accident. The following day the club played against Norwood and managed to overcome an early deficit to win the emotional charged game. The club would go on to win the 1988 premiership. , In 1989 seven out of ten SANFL clubs were recording losses and the combined income of the SANFL and WAFL had dropped to 40% of that of the VFL .  During early 1990 the SANFL decided to wait three years before making any further decision in regards to fielding a South Australian side in the VFL until it could be done without negatively affecting football within the state. Frustrated with lack of progress, Port Adelaide were having secret negotiations in the town of Quorn for entry in 1991.  From these discussions Port Adelaide Football Club accepted an invitation from the VFL to join what had now become the AFL. The AFL signed a Heads of Agreement with the club in expectation that Port would enter the competition in 1991, meaning the Port Adelaide Football Club would field two teams, one in the AFL and one in the SANFL. During the 1990 preseason Port Adelaide played a practice match against the Geelong Cats at Football Park in front of 35,000 spectators with Gary Ablett Snr and Gavin Wanganeen prominent. , When knowledge of Port Adelaide Football Club 's negotiations to gain an AFL licence were made public, the rest of the SANFL and many other people across the state saw it as an act of treachery. SANFL clubs urged Justice Olssen to make an injunction against the bid, which he agreed to.  The AFL suggested to the SANFL that if they didn't want Port Adelaide to join the AFL, they could put forward a counter bid to enter a composite South Australian side into the AFL. After legal action from all parties, the AFL finally agreed to accept the SANFL's bid and the Adelaide Football Club was born.  , The fallout from the failed bid resulted in some calling for Port Adelaide to be expelled from the SANFL.  However, Port Adelaide continued to compete and continued to dominate. Port Adelaide followed its triple triumphs from 1988 to 1990 with a premiership in 1992 and three in a row again from 1994 to 1996. When the Adelaide Crows entered the AFL, SANFL attendances dropped by 14% however Port Adelaide attendances increased by 13%.  Vocal supporters for Port Adelaide's AFL bid included Kevin Sheedy , Tom Hafey , Ron Barassi and David Parkin .  In 1994, the AFL announced it would award a second AFL licence to a South Australian club. Adelaide's Channel 7 broadcaster ran a phone poll asking whether Port Adelaide should get the second licence with 74% of the 6000 respondents saying 'yes'.  Present at the 1994 SANFL Grand Final was AFL CEO Ross Oakley and Alan Schwab who bore witness to the clubs come from behind win against the Woodville-West Torrens Eagles .  , During December 1994 Max Basher announced that Port Adelaide had won the tender for the second South Australian AFL licence.  However a licence did not guarantee entry and although a target year of 1996 was set, this was reliant upon an existing AFL club folding or merging with another. In 1996, the cash-strapped Fitzroy announced it would merge with the Brisbane Bears to form the Brisbane Lions . A spot had finally opened and it was announced that in 1997, one year later than expected, Port Adelaide would enter the AFL. , Once an entry date had been confirmed, the Port Adelaide Football Club set about forming a side fit for competition in the AFL. It was announced that existing Port Adelaide coach, John Cahill would make the transition to the AFL and Stephen Williams would take over the SANFL coaching role. Cahill then set about forming a group which would form the inaugural squad. Brownlow Medallist and 1990 Port Adelaide premiership player, Gavin Wanganeen was poached from Essendon and made captain of a team made up of six existing Port Adelaide players, two from the Adelaide Crows, seven players from other SANFL clubs and 14 recruits from interstate. , Star players for Port Adelaide during its pursuit of an AFL licence include among others Greg Phillips , Scott Hodges , Darren Smith , Tim Ginever , Stephen Williams , Mark Williams , Darryl Borlase , George Fiacchi , Roger Delaney and Bruce Abernethy .  , Port Adelaide in SANFL , On 29 March 1997, Port Adelaide played its first AFL premiership match against Collingwood at the MCG, suffering a 79-point defeat. Port won its first game in Round 3 against Geelong , and defeated cross town rivals and eventual premiers Adelaide by 11 points in the first Showdown in Round 4. At the conclusion of Round 17, the side sat fifth – only one win and percentage off the top spot in what was an unusually close season – but it fell out of the finals after recording only a draw from its final five games. Port Adelaide was widely tipped to take the wooden spoon at the start of the season [ citation needed ] , but defied the critics to finish 9th, missing the finals on percentage behind Brisbane. The 1998 season was looking very similar to the previous year as they hovered around ninth position for most of the year and looked like a threat for finals after Round 14; but they lost six of their last eight games to finish in 10th place, with a record of 9 wins, 12 losses and 1 draw. , In 1999 Mark Williams took over as coach of Port Adelaide. In only its third season the club played in the pre-season grand final against Hawthorn at Waverley Park . Port Adelaide lost 5.6 (36) to 12.11 (83). The season wasn't looking very promising and by Round 12 they had dropped down to a low of fourteenth. But they put together a five-game win streak from Round 13 through to Round 17 to eventually finish seventh and earn them a spot in the finals for the first time in the club's history. They were eliminated by eventual premier, North Melbourne, by 44 points in the Qualifying Final. The side fell away in 2000, winning only one of its first twelve games before ultimately finishing 14th with a record of 7–14–1. , Port Adelaide had a very successful 2001 season , starting with a maiden pre-season competition victory, defeating the Brisbane Lions 17.9 (111) to 3.8 (26) to become the first non-Melbourne based club to win the competition. Port Adelaide finished their 2001 home and away season in third place with 16 wins and six losses. The club travelled to Brisbane for the Qualifying Final, losing by 32 points, then lost its home Semi Final against sixth-placed Hawthorn to be eliminated: Port had led Hawthorn by 17 points going into the last quarter, but Hawthorn came back and Port lost by three points. , Port Adelaide started 2002 strongly, winning the pre-season competition for the second time in a row, defeating Richmond by 9 points. The side built on its success and won its first minor premiership with an 18–4 record. However, they could not convert this form into a Grand Final berth losing to the eventual premiers, the Brisbane Lions, by 56 points in the preliminary final. Port Adelaide continued its minor round dominance in 2003 and again finished top to claim the minor premiership; however like the previous year, Port Adelaide was eliminated in the preliminary finals, losing to Collingwood by 44 points. , Port Adelaide opened the 2004 season well with four straight wins, but then won only four of its next eight games, dropping to as low as fifth on the premiership table, three games below ladder leaders St Kilda . From Rounds 12–17, Port Adelaide turned their fortunes around and had six consecutive wins, and with five rounds remaining were equal top of the ladder with Brisbane , St Kilda and Melbourne . , After losing in Round 18 against Essendon, Port Adelaide won its remaining four games – including wins against minor premiership contender Melbourne and cross town rivals Adelaide to claim the minor premiership for the third consecutive year. Port Adelaide easily won its qualifying final against Geelong , earning a home preliminary final. Port Adelaide made it through to its first AFL grand final after defeating St Kilda in a thrilling preliminary final by just six points in front of over 46,000 people at home, with Gavin Wanganeen kicking the winning goal with about a minute to go. , The following, Port Adelaide faced a highly fancied Brisbane side attempting to win a record-equalling fourth straight AFL premiership. Only one point separated the sides at half time, however late in the third quarter Port Adelaide took the ascendency to lead by 17 points at three-quarter time, and dominated the final term to win by 40 points : 17.11 (113) to 10.13 (73). Byron Pickett was awarded with the Norm Smith Medal after being judged the best player in the match, tallying 20 disposals and kicking three goals. , After 2004, Port Adelaide struggled to maintain its form and endured a disappointing 2005. After a slow start to the season, they finished eighth on the ladder, and defeated the Kangaroos by 87 points in the elimination final. In the semi-final, Port faced the highly fancied minor premiers Adelaide in what was dubbed "The Ultimate Showdown" – the first occasion when the two cross-town rivals had met in a finals series. The result was 83 point loss for Port. The club missed the finals in 2006, winning eight games; young player Danyle Pearce won the AFL Rising Star award. , Port Adelaide made a strong recovery in 2007, and with strong performances from midfielders Shaun Burgoyne and Chad Cornes and strong debut seasons from Justin Westhoff , Robert Gray and Travis Boak , Port Adelaide finished the minor round second on the ladder with 15-7 record. , Port Adelaide started their finals campaign against the West Coast Eagles at AAMI Stadium and won a tight contest by three points: Port Adelaide 9.14 (68) d. West Coast 9.11 (65). That win gave Port the bye, and they easily defeated the Kangaroos in the preliminary final to win by 87 points: Port 20.13 (133) d. North Melbourne 5.16 (46). This win delivered Port its second Grand Final berth in four years. However, in the grand final they were defeated by Geelong by an AFL record margin of 119 points, 24.19 (163) to Port Adelaide's 6.8 (44) in a crowd of 97,302. , The 2008 season was disappointing one for a Port Adelaide side keen to build on its 2007 grand final appearance, dropping to 13th on the ladder and out of the finals. In 2009, Domenic Cassisi took on Port Adelaide's captaincy,  generated controversy due to coach Mark Williams originally wanting Shaun Burgoyne or Chad Cornes to be captain, which was overruled by Port Adelaide's administration board.  , During the 2009 pre-season Port Adelaide announced that they had requested an immediate seven-figure sum from the AFL in a bid to ease its financial crisis. Port Adelaide had accumulated a consolidated debt totaling $5.1 million and was unable to pay its players; they had lost $1.4 million the season before, and had their average home crowds drop to little more than 23,000.  However the financial assistance was denied by the league, with AFL chief executive Andrew Demetriou saying that they would have to undergo an intensive application process and work with the SANFL , who owned Port Adelaide's AFL licence.  On 20 May, Port were handed $2.5 million in debt relief by the SANFL, and on 15 June were handed a $1 million grant by the AFL commission.   By the end of the season the financial situation had reached the point where either the Port Adelaide Magpies (also suffering from crippling debt) or Port Adelaide could be forced to fold. The SANFL had announced it could support one club but not both. Plans for a merger of the two clubs to keep Port Adelaide in both the AFL and SANFL were rejected by the SANFL. The club's financial prospects were given a major boost in December 2009 when Premier Mike Rann announced a $450 million government commitment to redevelop Adelaide Oval, to enable AFL Football and home games for both Port and the Crows to be played in the city centre.  Amidst these off-field struggles, the club finished 10th in 2009. , The 2010 season started well for the club with it winning five of its first seven games. However, after that, Port Adelaide went on a club record nine-game losing streak. On 9 July 2010, Mark Williams stepped down as senior coach with a final game against Collingwood at Football Park, marking the end of the Williams era for the club. , Matthew Primus took over as caretaker coach for Port Adelaide after Mark Williams stood down and shortly after assistant coach Dean Laidley rejected the offer.  In Showdown 29, Port Adelaide ended its nine-game losing streak with a 19-point win over their crosstown rivals, the Adelaide Crows . The club finished the season with five wins from its last seven games under Primus, to finish tenth. Port Adelaide's administration board had started the search for a new coach and it was widely believed that Port Adelaide would appoint someone who had never been associated with the club before;  but, on 9 September, Matthew Primus was appointed as the senior coach of the club for the next three years. The club also saw the retirement of 2004 premiership players Josh Carr and Warren Tredrea . , In May 2011 the SANFL sought to take control of Port Adelaide. Despite the SANFL underwriting $5 million of Port's debt in 2010, the takeover failed when the SANFL was unable to get a line of credit to cover Port Adelaide's future debts. On 1 June it was announced that the AFL would underwrite $1.25 million in debt to protect its $1.25 billion television rights. AFL Chief executive Andrew Demetriou , offered $9 million over the next three years to help the club, ahead of the move to the Adelaide Oval , which resulted in the resignation of the Chief Executive, Mark Haysman, who was replaced by Keith Thomas , and three board members. The AFL gave the money to the SANFL with strict conditions that they give Port Adelaide three million dollars a year, for three years.  , Statistically, 2011 was Port Adelaide's worst season in 141 years, finishing 16th with only three wins from 22 games, ahead of only the Gold Coast Suns in their inaugural AFL season. Rounds 20 and 21 saw the club lose to Collingwood and Hawthorn by record margins of 138 and 165 respectively. The 2012 season was little better, and the club finished 14th with a record of 5–16–1; and a loss against the new expansion team Greater Western Sydney resulted in senior coach Matthew Primus 's contract being cut to the year's end, with Primus deciding to step down immediately. Assistant coach, Garry Hocking , took over for the remaining games four games, with his best result a draw in the final round against Richmond . , On 9 September 2012, Port Adelaide player John McCarthy died on an end of season trip in Las Vegas after falling from a ledge of The Flamingo Hotel.  Thousands of tributes and messages came from the general public, AFL supporters, players and other clubs. The Adelaide Football Club and Collingwood Football Club both wore black armbands for their semi-final matches and a minute's silence was observed at both games. , The 2013 season saw many significant changes in a new era for Port Adelaide. On 8 October 2012, Ken Hinkley was announced as the new senior coach of the club. This marked the first time that the club had appointed someone not associated with the club before since Fos Williams in 1950. Port Adelaide also had major changes within its administrative positions with television personality David Koch being named as the chairman of the club and numerous board members being replaced. The 2013 preseason also saw Travis Boak succeed Domenic Cassisi as the captain of the club.  For the first time in the club's history, Port Adelaide achieved 40,000 members in 2013. , Port Adelaide won its first five games, but then lost its next five games. Port then returned to form with upset wins against Sydney and Collingwood . Port recorded a famous Showdown win in Round 19, coming from 20 points down with six minutes to go to win by 4 points. The club finished the home and away season 7th on the ladder, making it the first time that they had qualified for the finals since 2007. Port travelled to Melbourne to play Collingwood at the MCG in an Elimination final where they won by 24 points; they then lost to Geelong by 16 points the following week. , The 2014 season saw both Port Adelaide and Adelaide move their home ground from Football Park to the redeveloped Adelaide Oval . Building on its 2013 success and its move to the more central venue, off-field Port Adelaide signed up a record 55,715 members for the 2014 season, and averaged 44,429 at home games, a 65% increase from the previous year. On-field, Port Adelaide had its best ever first half to an AFL season, sitting first with ten wins from eleven matches. They then won only four of their remaining eleven matches to finish 5th on the ladder. They hosted Richmond in the elimination final, kicking the first seven goals of the game and leading by as much as 87 points before recording a 57-point victory. They faced Fremantle in the semi-final, and after trailing by 24 points at half time, Port kicked 12 goals to 5 in the second half to win by 22 points. Their 2014 season ended with a three-point loss to Hawthorn in the preliminary final. , Port Adelaide's 2015 pre-season began with Essendon ruckman Paddy Ryder requesting a trade to Port Adelaide.  On the final day of trade week, Ryder was traded to the club boosting its ruck stocks.  For the second consecutive season, Port Adelaide had lost another assistant coach to a senior coaching position at another club, this time Phil Walsh , who became the coach of the Adelaide Crows from 2015. Walsh was replaced by Michael Voss , a former premiership player and former senior coach of the Brisbane Lions .  , David Koch's appointment to chairman was a key part of the club's improved off-field position. , 2014 was the first time since 1976 that the club played all its home games at Adelaide Oval . , Robbie Gray won the AFL Coaches' Association Player of the Year in 2014. , When the Port Adelaide Football Club entered the AFL, a new state league team was created to fill the void left by the club. The new club was now called the Port Adelaide Magpies Football Club as opposed to the original counterpart, the Port Adelaide Football Club, playing in the national competition.  , The new Port Adelaide Magpies won the 1998 and 1999 SANFL premierships. , On 20 August 2010, the "One Port Adelaide Football Club" movement was launched by a former player, Tim Ginever , in a bid to merge the Port Adelaide Football Club and the Port Adelaide Magpies Football Club, in the SANFL competition, as one club. The movement created a website for people to sign so that the Power and the Magpies might become one club. The website claimed that it needed at least 50,000 people to sign up for the Power and the Magpies to merge. On 15 November 2010, all nine SANFL clubs came together for a meeting to decide if the merger would go ahead. The meeting decided that the off-field merger between the two clubs would proceed.   , On 10 September 2013, Port Adelaide and the SANFL agreed to a model to allow all its AFL -listed players (not selected to play for Port Adelaide in the AFL) to play for the Magpies in the SANFL League competition (the Adelaide Crows will also have a reserves team playing in the SANFL from 2014). On October 4, 2013, Port Adelaide's AFL assistant coach Garry Hocking was announced as the SANFL senior coach of the reserves side.  For the 2014 season, the Port Magpies won the minor premiership by winning 12 games and placing top of the ladder. After defeating the South Adelaide by 20 points in the second semi-final, they reached their first SANFL Grand Final since 1999, where they lost to the Norwood Football Club by 4 points. , From 2015 onward, the club would lose its recruiting zones and no longer field sides in the Under 18s, 16s, 15s, 14s and 13s SANFL competition. In turn, Port Adelaide will operate an Academy team composed of 18 to 22 year old's.  , This was a controversial decision amongst local supporters but the structure ensured that talented local juniors can still play for the club through the academy. The restructure is expected to benefit local clubs such as Port District, North Haven and Portland with juniors being re-absorbed by these grassroots teams. , Due to the fact that Collingwood , an existing VFL/AFL club, was already using the Magpie emblem and Magpies' nickname, Port Adelaide was requested by the VFL to simply find a new nickname and logo to avoid a clash.  However, after the unsuccessful 1990 bid, Collingwood successfully lobbied the AFL to force Port Adelaide to change not only its logo and nickname but also its guernsey and colours. In 1995, a new guernsey was created with the look unveiled made up of black, white, silver and teal which represents the water of the Port River . The logo consisted of three strips reflecting the colours. , Controversy concerning the AFL's refusal to permit Port Adelaide to wear its traditional black-and-white "prison bar" guernsey in the competitions heritage-themed rounds came to head 2007 . Earlier in that year, Port Adelaide chief executive John James said the club was waiting for confirmation from the AFL that it could wear its 1970s prison bar guernsey for a match against the Western Bulldogs . He said Port was also looking for confirmation it would be able to continue to honour its heritage in any future heritage rounds. Port Adelaide decided not to participate in the 2006 heritage round when the AFL did not approve the club's 1980s-style black-and-white guernsey for its 80s themed heritage round. Collingwood club president Eddie McGuire has been a vocal opponent of Port Adelaide wearing the prison bar guernsey, claiming that Collingwood has an exclusive right to wear black and white in the AFL, even in the heritage round. , John James stated that Port Adelaide possibly received more correspondence from its supporters about the heritage guernsey than about any other issue and that the club would "continue to fight for its heritage and what is right".  On 14 May 2007 the AFL and Port Adelaide reached an agreement whereby the club could wear its prison bar guernsey in the heritage round this season, with the proviso that in future seasons its players can only wear it in home heritage round games and provided that such a game is not against Collingwood.  No heritage rounds have been held since this agreement was reached. , On 17 July 2009, Port Adelaide unveiled a special one-off Power guernsey, now known as the "Back in Black" guernsey, which was designed by a 7-year-old student from Ardtornish Primary school. The guernsey has a predominantly black design with a white and teal "V" and a prominent Power logo. On 28 October 2009, Port Adelaide received AFL approval to wear the jumper in premiership matches. , Main Guernsey , Clash Guernsey , Traditional Guernsey , Before the bounce at Port Adelaide's Adelaide Oval home games the fans hold up their scarves and sing to Australian band INXS 's song Never Tear Us Apart . It is a reference to the various and unique difficulties the club faced when trying to enter the AFL . , The AFL side's victory song is "Power to Win", written for the club by Quentin Eyers and Les Kaczmarek . , The SANFL side's victory song is "Cheer, Cheer the Black and the White", to the tune of Notre Dame Victory March . , At Port Adelaide home games the fans hold up scarves before the bounce whilst singing Never Tear Us Apart by Australian band INXS . , On 15 May 1880, Port Adelaide played its first match at Alberton Oval. In 1881 the decision was made by the club to start leasing the oval from the Port Adelaide Council for the sum of 10 shillings a year. , The ground has played host to a number of memorable matches in its time and in 1977 a record crowd of 22,738 attended. , Situated at the eastern end of the suburb of Alberton in Adelaide, the playing surface is surrounded by the Allan Scott Power Headquarters, the Robert B. Quinn MM Stand, the Fos Williams Family Stand, the Port Adelaide Bowling Club and the N.L. Williams Scoreboard. , As well as the facilities facing the oval, along Queen Street there is The Port Club and The Port Store.  , Glanville Hall Estate , Alberton Oval , Football Park , Adelaide Oval , Adelaide Crows ( Showdown ) - Early during 1990 the SANFL had decided to wait three years before making any further decision regarding entering a team into the national competition. Frustrated with lack of progress, Port Adelaide began having secret negotiations with the AFL in the town of Quorn for entry a 1991 entrance into the competition. [5] When knowledge of Port Adelaide's negotiations to gain an AFL licence were made public, the rest of the SANFL and many other people across the state saw it as an act of treachery. SANFL clubs urged Justice Olssen to make an injunction against the bid, which he agreed to. [4] The SANFL out of legal necessity promptly created a composite team to beat Port Adelaide's bid. The Adelaide Football Club gained what was very close to being Port Adelaide's licence to the AFL and began playing in 1991. , Collingwood Magpies - The rivalry with the Collingwood Football Club stems entirely from the controversy surrounding Port Adelaide's identity upon entering the AFL, sharing both the Magpie moniker and black and white colours with Collingwood before 1997. Whenever Port Adelaide tries to wear its fabled Prison Bar guernsey that won the club 33 premierships and 3 national titles, the Collingwood administration, particularly Eddie McGuire , try and prevent it occurring. The rivalry extends on field with Port Adelaide having defeated Collingwood to win the 1910 Championship of Australia along with knocking the club out of the 2013 AFL finals series , whilst Collingwood defeated Port Adelaide in the 2002 and 2003 AFL finals series , knocking the club out in the second instance. , Norwood Redlegs ( Port Adelaide-Norwood SANFL rivalry ) - The rivalry between Norwood and Port Adelaide is arguably the oldest in Australian Football. The two clubs began playing each other in 1878, the year Norwood was formed, and currently share between themselves half of all the SAFA/SAFL/SANFL premierships awarded. Along with being the two traditional powerhouse clubs of South Australian football, there is a geographic and economic split between the two teams. Norwood is located on the wealthier eastern side of the city whereas Port Adelaide is located in the western suburbs of Greater Adelaide. Over 400 matches have been played between the two clubs, including 50 finals matches and 17 Grand Finals. Matches against Norwood still attract large crowds with 38,644 attending the 2014 SANFL Grand Final . , Brisbane Lions - The rivalry with Brisbane stems from a string of classic matches during the early 2000's when both clubs were dominant teams in the AFL. Port Adelaide ended Brisbane's attempt at winning four consecutive AFL premierships in the 2004 AFL Grand Final . , North Melbourne Kangaroos - Port Adelaide's traditional bogey side wins two out of every three matches between the clubs despite Port Adelaide having a greater win percentage compared to North Melbourne during its time in the league. North Melbourne also leased Port Adelaide legend Russell Ebert during the 1979 football season, however he would return at seasons end. , Sturt Double Blues - Sturt brought to an end Port Adelaide's first halcyon era in the 1915 SAFL Grand Final after Port went the previous year undefeated whilst claiming national honours . During the mid 1960s and early 1970s Sturt with Jack Oatey at the helm would frustrate Port Adelaide and Fos Williams who had recently won 9 of the last 12 premierships. Sturt would trump Port Adelaide in the 1966 , 1967 and 1968 SANFL grand finals in front of large crowds at Adelaide Oval. Sturt also managed a significant upset in the 1976 SANFL Grand Final beating the favourites in Port with a state record 66,897 ticketed spectators (police quoted 80,000) watching at Football Park. , The creed was written and spoken for the first time in 1962 by Port Adelaide great Fos Williams  , "We, the Players and Management of the Port Adelaide Football Club, accept the heritage which players and administrators have passed down to us; in doing so we do not intend to rest in idleness but shall strive with all our power to further this Club's unexcelled achievements. To do this we believe there is a great merit and noble achievements in winning a premiership. , To be successful, each of us must be active, aggressive and devoted to this cause. We agree that success is well within our reach and have confidence that each member of both the team and management will suffer personal sacrifices for the common end. , Also we know that, should we after striving to our utmost and giving our everything, still not be successful, our efforts will become a further part of this Club's enviable tradition. , Finally, we concede that there can be honour in defeat, but to each of us, honourable defeat of our Club and guernsey can only come after human endeavour on the playing field is completely exhausted." , Head coach , Assistant coaches , , Head coach , Assistant coaches , Port Adelaide has many supporter groups, with every state or territory containing at least one supporter group. In addition, many country towns within South Australia have their own supporter group, many of which travel to both home and away games.

All 22 members of the team played significant parts in ensuring the club's rise from the SANFL to the AFL in 1997 – and the demand of the SA Football Commission that a Magpies team be kept in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL). There are 201 premiership medals held by the 22 players in the Greatest Team; 532 State games; 16 Magarey Medal and a long list of accolades and achievements. , † denotes killed in action or died while serving , The Magarey Medal is an Australian rules football award, given annually since 1898 to the fairest and most brilliant player in the Home and Away season of the South Australian National Football League (SANFL) as adjudged by the field umpires. The award was created by William Ashley Magarey , then chairman of the league. The following list is players who won the Magarey Medal playing for Port Adelaide in the SANFL. , Post AFL entry , The AFL Coaches Association Champion Player of the Year award is voted on a week to week basis of each round by Senior Coaches on a 5,4,3,2,1 basis. Each Senior Coach votes on their match only and any player suspensions are disregarded. , In every round an Australian Football League rising star nomination is given to a standout young player. To be eligible for the award, a player must be under 21 on 1 January of that year, have played 10 or fewer senior games before the beginning of the season, and not have been suspended during the season. At the end of the season, nine AFL personalities (typically administrators and All-Australian team selectors) vote for five of the twenty-two rising star nominees, with their top selections earning five votes, their second selection earning four votes, etc. The player who receives the most votes is the winner. , The Norm Smith Medal is the award given in the AFL Grand Final to the player adjudged by an independent panel of experts to have been the best player in the match. , The Jack Oatey Medal is the award given in the SANFL Grand Final to the player adjudged by the umpires to have been the best player in the match. , Post AFL entry , Sporting Life magazine invented the concept of an All-Australian Team in 1947. A squad was selected from players in various leagues in October each year by a panel chosen by the magazine. It provided an unofficial All-Australian team for the late 1940s and early 1950s. , The All-Australian Team is an all star team of Australian rules footballers, selected by a panel at the end of each season. It represents a complete team, including interchange players and a coach, of the best performed during an interstate Carnival or series of matches (1953-1988), or during the season (1991–present). , After the club's first season in the AFL the club's Best and Fairest award was named after 10 time premiership coach John Cahill . , The Fos Williams Medal is named in honour of former legendary player and coach Fos Williams and is awarded to the player's choice for the club's Best Team Man. , The Gavin Wanganeen Medal is an award to Port Adelaide's best player under the age of 21. The award, struck in 2006, is named after Gavin Wanganeen , a former champion with both Port Adelaide and Essendon who, by the age of 21, had won a SANFL premiership with Port Adelaide, an AFL premiership with Essendon, a Brownlow Medal and two All Australian awards. , The Coaches' Award replaced the Most Improved and Best First Year awards in 2011. This reward is selected by the entire Port Adelaide coaching committee and is bestowed to reward the Port Adelaide player who best exhibits the team behaviours of selflessness, humility and reliability. , The award, named in honour of the late John McCarthy , recognises outstanding service to the community when representing the club and is decided by the leadership group and coaches. , Most games played , Most games coached , Most premierships as player , Most premierships as coach , Most goals for Port Adelaide , Most goals in a match , Most goals in a season , Where the term "Combined" is used it refers to the premier Port Adelaide Football Club team at that time.

This currently sees the club ranked sixth in terms of premierships won. , In recent times, unstable administration on and off the field has troubled Richmond, none more so than in 1990 when a large debt almost forced the club to fold. Richmond has since regained a strong financial position, but this has not translated to any significant success on field, with the team only reaching the finals four times since (in 1995 , 2001 , 2013 and 2014 ) and failing to win a match in the latter two appearances with elimination final exits. , Since the club's inception in 1885, it has been based at the Punt Road Oval , formerly known as the Richmond Cricket Ground , a few hundred metres to the east of the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). The Tigers have played their home games at the MCG since 1965. The club's training and administration headquarters are at the Punt Road Oval and from 2011 is called the ME Bank Centre.  , Based in a traditionally working-class area, Richmond has long-standing rivalries with cross town Melbourne based clubs, Collingwood , Carlton and Essendon . , Many notable players have represented Richmond over the years. Some of these players have been recognised as being among Australian rules football's greatest players. Such players include Jack Dyer , Kevin Bartlett , Royce Hart , Francis Bourke , Ian Stewart , Matthew Richardson and Jack Titus . , , , A team of footballers playing as Richmond is mentioned by the newspapers in the first years of Australian football , circa 1860.  Tom Wills , one of the game's founders, was the club's inaugural secretary and captain,  and Wills' cousin H. C. A. Harrison captained Richmond briefly in the early 1860s before moving to Geelong .  This loosely organised group has no continuity to the present club. A number of teams formed in the Richmond area during the game's rapid expansion of the 1870s and early 1880s.  However, all played at a junior level and it was considered an anomaly that Richmond, one of Melbourne's biggest locales, did not boast a senior team. The wait ended when the Richmond Football Club was officially formed at the Royal Hotel in Richmond on 20 February 1885.  A successful application for immediate admission to the Victorian Football Association (VFA) followed. The club shared the Punt Road Oval with the Richmond Cricket Club , one of the strongest cricket clubs in Australia which had been playing on the ground since 1856.  , At first the team wore a blue uniform. One of the most important features of a nineteenth-century footballer's uniform was his headgear, and Richmond opted for yellow and black striped caps, the same as the cricket club. After a couple of years, yellow and black stripes replaced blue as the colours of the team's guernseys. The team was variously called the "Richmondites", the "Wasps" or, most commonly, the "Tigers". , During the late 1880s, the VFA expanded rapidly. A booming economy and large numbers of immigrants made Melbourne the largest city in the Australian colonies. The city was mad with football and many clubs tried to get admission to the VFA. Richmond struggled to make an impression and after a promising season in 1888 (when they finished fifth with eleven wins), the club slipped backwards. In an amateur sport, the strongest teams were luring the best talent with undisclosed payments to players and were not keen to schedule matches against teams with poor followings (such as Richmond) that could not generate much gate money. , As the local economy slipped into severe depression in the early 1890s and the crowds began to dwindle, a number of strong teams began to agitate for a reform of the competition. Richmond were not considered part of this elite group, who usually voted together as a block at VFA meetings. A lack of commitment and focused effort was holding the Tigers back. In 1896, Richmond walked off the field in a match with South Melbourne at half time when they were a long way behind on a very wet day to protest the umpiring. Later in the season, the Tigers had their score annulled against Essendon when it was discovered that they had too many men on the ground. In the closing three weeks of the season, Richmond's gate takings amounted to just five pounds. , Richmond finished the season last of the 13 clubs. In October 1896, the cabal of six strong clubs broke with the association to form the Victorian Football League (VFL) and invited two other clubs to join them: Carlton and St Kilda . Richmond's struggles during the season had not helped when the invitations to the new competition were being considered. Richmond's performances did not immediately improve in the emaciated VFA until the turn of the century. , The Tigers were boosted by a significant country recruit in 1901. George "Mallee" Johnson was an instant sensation and the first true star player at the club. Richmond leapt to third place and then in 1902, with Johnson dominating the ruck, Richmond entered the closing weeks of the season neck and neck with Port Melbourne at the head of the ladder. Just when a play-off between the clubs to decide the premiership looked certain, Port Melbourne faltered against Williamstown to hand Richmond its first flag. , Having missed a potential bonanza from a premiership play-off, the VFA decided to emulate the VFL and introduce a finals series in 1903, a fateful decision for the Tigers. After recruiting the competition's leading goalkicker, Jack Hutchinson , and finishing the season as minor premier , Richmond lost both finals and were runner-up . The following season, the club became embroiled in a feud with umpire Allen, whom the Tigers accused of failing to curb field invasions or the illegal tactics of arch-rival North Melbourne . , When the two clubs were scheduled to meet in the 1904 VFA Grand Final , Richmond announced that they wouldn't play with Allen as umpire. The VFA called Richmond's bluff, and appointed Allen as umpire for the match, meaning that the Grand Final was scratched and North Melbourne won the premiership on forfeit. Richmond were now openly at odds with the VFA and matters failed to improve in the next few years. , The club was campaigning against violence (both on-field and among the crowd), ungentlemanly conduct and poor sportsmanship, issues that plagued the VFA to a far greater extent than the rival VFL. Richmond cultivated links with some VFL clubs by playing practice matches against them. Richmond knew that they were a major asset to the VFA. They had built up a large following and played on one of the best grounds in the competition, where they remained unbeaten for five consecutive seasons. In 1905, Richmond confirmed their status with a second premiership, this time overcoming bitter rivals North Melbourne , "Mallee" Johnson had moved to Carlton, but youngster Charlie Ricketts dominated the season and won plaudits among the pressmen, who voted him the best player in the VFA. , However, Ricketts was also lost to the VFL and injury hit the club hard. In 1906–07, the Tigers played finals without looking likely to win the flag. The club earned a rebuke from the VFA for scheduling a practice match against Geelong before the 1907 season. Richmond went ahead with the commitment and earned further censure. Later in the year it became clear that the VFL wanted to expand its competition and Richmond won a place ahead of North Melbourne, which had been strengthened by an amalgamation with the bankrupt West Melbourne as part of their bid. Richmond were granted admission along with the now defunct University Football Club . , The first few seasons in the VFL were less than spectacular. Although the club turned up some star players, it let a lot of talent leave and the administration was unstable after George Bennett 's death at the end of the 1908 season. In 1916, the side played in the finals for the first time, however, with World War I having reduced the competition to just four clubs, finals qualification was automatic. , Finally, in 1919, Richmond made their first Grand Final appearance, losing to Collingwood . Richmond stoked a rivalry with Collingwood by recruiting their former skipper Dan Minogue as playing coach and gained vengeance by beating Collingwood in the 1920 VFL Grand Final to secure a first flag in the big league. This was followed by an even better performance the next year. The only club that continued to beat Richmond on a regular basis was Carlton. Finishing minor premier with only one loss for the season in 1921, Carlton were the hottest premiership favourite, yet Richmond managed to beat them in two classic finals matches played over successive weeks to go back-to-back. , The rest of the decade saw four more Grand Final appearances, all of which would end in frustration. From 1927 to 1929 Richmond became the first club in the VFL to lose three consecutive Grand Finals, all of which were to neighbouring arch rivals, Collingwood. , The next VFL flag came in 1932, with Richmond's triumph over Carlton in a tough encounter which saw Richmond wingman Alan Geddes play the second half with a broken jaw. Another premiership came in 1934, this time against South Melbourne's famed "Foreign Legion", avenging Richmond's loss in the 1933 VFL Grand Final . , Prior to the commencement of the 1940 season, internal problems were brewing between the key personalities at the club. Some felt that the uneven performance of the team was due to Percy Bentley 's coaching methods, and that he should be replaced. Jack Dyer walked out on the club and threatened to play in the VFA after his father, a committeeman who was involved with the anti-Bentley faction, lost his position at the board elections. Finally, the matter was resolved and Bentley kept his job, while Dyer returned to training on the eve of the season. The problems appeared to have been solved when Richmond won the semi-final against Melbourne to go straight into the 1940 VFL Grand Final . However, Melbourne reversed this result with a crushing win to pinch the premiership. Richmond had been out-thought by their old mentor Frank 'Checker' Hughes , who had assigned a tagger to negate Dyer. Dyer was furious that Bentley had done nothing to prevent his opponent taking him out of the game. The Richmond committee agreed with this assessment, so when Bentley (after retiring as a player) attempted to negotiate a higher fee to continue his coaching tenure, he was rebuffed. Incensed, Bentley quit Punt Road and moved to Carlton as coach, adding further spice to an already fierce rivalry between the two clubs. , Despite the tribulations created by the Second World War, Richmond was able to maintain a commendable level of consistency on the field. The club had quite a lot of players in reserved occupations who remained at home, while the administration became adept at securing star players who were temporarily in Melbourne on war service. [ citation needed ] [ examples needed ] Dyer was a fearsome presence in his role as playing coach, but he was unable to improve Richmond's ability to win finals matches. A loss in the 1942 VFL Grand Final to Essendon (after starting as favourite) meant that over the previous 18 years, Richmond had won two flags but been runner-up eight times. Jack Titus set a still unbeaten record of playing in six losing Grand Final teams. In 1943, Richmond broke through to beat Essendon in a thrilling Grand Final by five points, a win that the club dedicated to ex-player Bill Cosgrove, an RAF pilot who had been killed in action a few weeks before the match. But another Grand Final loss followed in 1944 , when Dyer's team failed against Fitzroy on a very hot day. , In the immediate post-war era, despite an influx of excellent new players, Richmond struggled to make the four, appearing in the finals only once, in 1947. Dyer continued on as coach for three years after his playing retirement at the end of 1949, but was asked to retire by the committee who felt the club needed a shake up. Under a succession of coaches in the 1950s, With the demands of potential players increasing with each passing year, the club refused to allocate sufficient funds to recruit and they failed to replace star players as they retired. When stalwarts such as Des Rowe and dual- Brownlow Medallist Roy Wright left, the team slumped dramatically and finished with a wooden spoon in 1960. , 1966 heralded the start of the Tom Hafey era. Hafey, a former player of the club, was appointed coach and lead the club to winning four premierships under his leadership. They won the 1967 flag in a thrilling encounter with Geelong, ending a 24-year premiership drought. In 1969, it became two in three years as Richmond, who had finished fourth on the ladder, beat the much fancied Carlton in the 1969 VFL Grand Final by 25 points. , Richmond were dominant in 1972 and were hot favourites in the 1972 VFL Grand Final against Carlton. However, Carlton stunned Richmond in a game of ridiculous high scoring. Even Richmond equalled the then record highest score in a Grand Final of 22.18 (150), but Carlton beat it with 28.9 (177). Richmond got their revenge in an intensely physical clash in the 1973 VFL Grand Final and went back-to-back in 1974 with a strong win against a resurgent North Melbourne. , Richmond won its last premiership with a then record-breaking margin of 81 points over arch-rivals Collingwood in 1980 . After reaching and losing the 1982 VFL Grand Final , it has been a rocky road for Richmond who have struggled to come to grips with the rules and regulations of a modernised VFL, including the draft and salary cap . The successes of the early 1980s were bought at high financial cost through expensive recruiting, and were followed by severe cut backs that saw several top players depart. , Still smarting from the loss of star players to Collingwood, Richmond set themselves for war with Collingwood in 1984 by signing three of their players: John Annear , Craig Stewart and Phil Walsh . Not only were there big contracts and transfer fees to pay, but the costs of an expensive court action as well. , Richmond also signed a number of mediocre players on big contracts, and the club's financial situation took a battering. With the team failing to improve, a challenge to the committee was brewing and Richmond's traditional political stability threatened. The rebel group, organised by long-time servant Bill Durham, convinced former player and coach Barry Richardson to be leader. An election in late 1984 failed to clarify the situation. , Ian Wilson held on to the presidency into the new year. When the one hundredth birthday of the club arrived in February 1985, there was too much dissension to mark the moment fittingly. Eventually, Wilson handed over to Richardson, who had selected his former premiership teammate Paul Sproule to return from Tasmania and take over the coaching position on a guaranteed contract. , As the season progressed with Richmond still struggling, Sproule came under pressure. Richardson guaranteed his position, but at the end of the year, the committee overruled Richardson and sacked Sproule. Incensed, Richardson walked out of Punt Road, which was in turmoil again. Desperately, Richmond turned back to Tony Jewell , who was appointed coach for a second time, the only man in the club's history to get a second go at the job. Jewell later commented on the destruction wrought on the club during his four-year absence: "the supporters were gone, the members were gone, the money was gone, ... a real shame." , With the competition set to expand, Richmond made a number of misguided moves in 1986. To fill the vacancy left by Richardson, Richmond wooed high-flying West Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond to become president. Bond came with an agenda to raise money for the club by listing on the stockmarket and relocating to Brisbane . When the latter plan was revealed in the media, a furious reaction from supporters and high profile club personalities buried the proposal almost immediately. Early in 1987, Bond's tenure at the club ended in farce when he resigned without presiding over a single game. The off-field confusion was reflected in the players' performance as Richmond slumped to only its second wooden spoon in 70 years. , Although the new president, ex-captain Neville Crowe , had stabilised the club and scored a coup by persuading club legend Kevin Bartlett to coach, The club managed to stay solvent by cutting expenses to the bone and paying only two-thirds of the allowable salary cap. But there was no money for recruiting to improve an impoverished playing list. The club struggled to come to terms with the draft after its inception in 1986, and made a number of poor choices—notably, the number one pick in 1987 was used on a player who had only two games with Richmond. , Finally, with the economy in serious recession and interest rates touching seventeen per cent, Richmond's creditors came knocking. At one point, an attempt was made to seize the club's 1973 and 1974 premiership trophies as securities for unpaid debts, an embarrassing situation. For a number of years, the exact amount that the club owed was not publicly known. After Bartlett came Allan Jeans, who then passed the job to ex-Richmond premiership player John Northey for 1993. Northey returned the team to the simple long-kicking style of the halcyon days under the legendary Tom Hafey. Along with some draft concessions granted by the AFL, Northey's efforts gradually improved Richmond. The team fumbled an opportunity to make the 1994 finals, then opened 1995 with its best start to a season in 75 years and eventually made it to the preliminary final. With a talented playing list and a strong administration led by Leon Daphne (Richmond's first president from the corporate world, the Alan Bond farce aside), Richmond looked set to become regular finalists again. , During 1992 the Richmond Football Club logo was redesigned by Rob Perry (see external links), while he was working as an art director at the advertising agency George Patterson Bates in Melbourne. The illustration of the tiger was done by Lex Bell, the in-house illustrator of the agency. , The anticipated success failed to materialise, partly because Richmond allowed the coaching position to again become unstable. With over a year still to run on his contract, John Northey demanded a contract extension that the club refused. This was because of a rumour that some people with an association with the club were pursuing Essendon coach and former Richmond premiership player Kevin Sheedy . So Northey walked out on Richmond and accepted a longer-term contract to coach the Brisbane Bears . Richmond, caught short, appointed the Bears' ex-coach Robert Walls for 1996. After several humiliating thrashings in 1997, Robert Walls became the first Richmond coach to be sacked mid-season. After two-and-a-half seasons under Jeff Gieschen , the club appointed ex-St Kilda captain Danny Frawley . After a Preliminary Final appearance in Frawley's second season, Richmond overestimated the strength of the list and settled for trading for established players rather than drafting youth. Over the next three seasons, the team managed just 18 wins. The administration continued to support Frawley and ensured that he would see out his contract, a far cry from the way many of his predecessors were treated. However, midway through the 2004 season (a season in which Richmond only managed 4 wins, and lost their last 14 H&A matches), Frawley announced he would be relinquishing his role as Richmond coach at seasons' end. , The 2005 pre-season began with renewed optimism at the club, with No. 1 draft pick Brett Deledio being touted as a future star and leader. However, the Tigers' first match of the season (against Geelong ), quickly dashed that hope, as they were thrashed by 62 points. However, this loss would spark a change in the Tigers, and in the next 8 weeks of the season, they would go on to win 7 matches (the one exception being a 68-point loss at the hands of St. Kilda in Round 5). This included wins over the then-reigning premiers, Port Adelaide , and over then-runners up, the Brisbane Lions . Sitting pretty at 7 wins and 2 losses, and 3rd on the ladder, the impossible prospect of finals football loomed large. However, in the Round 10 match against Melbourne , star player Nathan Brown suffered a horrible leg injury, that would sideline him for the rest of the season. They went on to lose the match by 57 points, and would only register 3 more wins for the season (one of those was against eventual premiers the Sydney Swans by one point, who had a one-point win against Collingwood the round before), eventually finishing 12th. , 2006, a year which many experts predicted continued improvement for the Tigers, saw them lose their first H&A match by 115 points, against the Western Bulldogs , after which followed losses to St Kilda and West Coast . By the end of Round 3, things were looking grim for the Tigers once again. However, just as they did in 2005, the Tigers would respond to their poor start by winning 8 of their next 11 matches, and by the end of Round 14, the Tigers were in the Top 8 by a game and percentage. However, their spot in the Top 8 would be short lived, as 4 straight losses between Rounds 15 and 18 would effectively end their finals chances. They finished the 2006 season in 9th place, with 11 wins and 11 losses. , After promising seasons in 2005 and 2006, it was expected that the Tigers would take the next step in 2007, and play finals football. After massive hype in the off-season, the Tigers had a terrible start to the 2007 season, losing their first 9 matches (this included suffering their biggest ever defeat, at the hands of eventual premiers Geelong , by a whopping 157 points). Their first premiership points came in a draw against the Brisbane Lions in Round 10, and their first win of the season didn't come until Round 12 against fellow straggler Melbourne . After Round 18 of the season, the Tigers had registered a mere 1 win, 1 draw, and 16 losses, and were looking like recording their worst ever recorded season. However, late-season victories over old rivals Collingwood in Round 19, and Essendon in Round 21, saved them from this fate. They would eventually finish the year as wooden-spooners, with 3 wins, 1 draw, and 18 losses. , After the end of the 2007 season , Richmond elected to delist Patrick Bowden , Brent Hartigan , Andrew Krakouer and Carl Peterson . These four joined another four players in leaving Punt Road—veteran Darren Gaspar , Kent Kingsley , Trent Knobel and Ray Hall . While these players left the club Jake King and Angus Graham were elevated off the rookie list. , During the trade period the Tigers obtained Bulldog midfielder Jordan McMahon along with Eagle forward Mitch Morton . , Next up came the 2007 AFL Draft , in which the Tigers recruited highly rated midfielder Trent Cotchin with their first pick (No. 2 overall), backman Alex Rance (pick No. 18 overall) and ruckman Dean Putt (pick No. 51 overall). Then, in the pre-season draft, they elected to pick David Gourdis with the number one pick. The Tigers also picked Clayton Collard , Jarrod Silvester , Tristan Cartledge and Cameron Howat for the rookie list. Cam Howat had previously been on the rookie list but was delisted then picked up again. , The Tigers had kept a low profile going into their Round 1 clash against Carlton . Many people predicted that Carlton would run all over Richmond because Carlton had received Chris Judd during the trade period. The Tigers trailed by as much as 25 points during the second quarter but they came back, led by Matthew Richardson kicking five goals. The Tigers ended up winning 17.7 (109) to Carlton 11.13 (79) in front of a crowd of 72,552 at the MCG . , From Rounds 2 to 11 however, the Tigers would only register two more wins (and a controversial draw against the Western Bulldogs ). After Round 11's completion they sat in 12th place with three wins, one draw and seven losses. While many people wrote the Tigers of 2008 off at this point, they defied the odds and went on to win eight of their last 11 matches to finish off the 2008 season strongly, recording 11 wins, one draw and 10 losses. However, this would not be enough to get them into finals football, as they finished two premiership points short (and percentage) of 8th placed Collingwood , who finished with 12 wins and 10 losses. , At the start of 2009, Richmond was said to be rising as a team, and they would be in the eight . [ citation needed ] They had recruited former Brownlow Medallist Ben Cousins , and they had rising stars in Brett Deledio and Trent Cotchin . However, the club was beaten by 83 points in Round 1 by Carlton, and did not register a win until Round 5, against North Melbourne . With a record of 2–9 after eleven weeks, Terry Wallace stepped down as coach, having announced his intention during the previous week. Jade Rawlings was announced as caretaker senior coach; he adopted a youth policy for the remainder of the year, which saw experienced players Joel Bowden and Matthew Richardson retire by the end of the year. Rawlings led Richmond to three wins and a draw from eleven games. Richmond finished fifteenth with a record of 5–16–1. On 25 August, Damien Hardwick was appointed to be the senior coach from 2010. , As Jade Rawlings and Craig McRae and Brian Royal left the Tigers assistant coaching panel, Brendon Lade and Justin Leppitsch were appointed as assistant coaches, leaving only Wayne Campbell as a previous Richmond assistant coach. Brendon Gale was also appointed CEO of the Tigers. , Richmond was not expected to be competitive in 2010, with many commentators predicting the team would win no more than four games. From the 2009 AFL Draft , the Tigers drafted seven new players, which included midfielder Dustin Martin . At the 2010 Pre-season Draft, Richmond recruited young key defender Dylan Grimes , brother of Melbourne defender Jack Grimes . , Damien Hardwick selected a young team at the start of the season, with four debutants, and very few [ quantify ] players over 25 in the Round 1 loss against Carlton . Richmond was winless after nine games, before a scrappy win over Port Adelaide in Round 10. This was the start of a turnaround in Richmond's form, with the team winning six out of eight games, to sit with a record of 6–12 after eighteen rounds. After losing the final four matches, Richmond finished fifteenth out of sixteen with a record of 6–16. Young key forward Jack Riewoldt finished the season with 78 goals, to win the Coleman Medal . , Very early in the season, Richmond were criticised for "partying too much" in the wake of its winless start to the season; after the Round 3 loss to the Sydney Swans , Richmond players were reported to be at the bar drinking and acting in a disorderly manner.  , Richmond continued to show improvement to finish 12th out of 17 teams in 2011 with eight wins including a strong win over Port Adelaide in Alice Springs mid-season. , Jack Riewoldt again led the goalkicking with 62 majors, down on his previous year's tally of 78. Young midfielder Trent Cotchin won his first Jack Dyer Medal with 236 votes.  Cotchin also polled the most votes of any Richmond player in the 2011 Brownlow Medal count with 15 votes. Dustin Martin was next best, polling 12 votes.  , Richmond's 2012 season did not see an improvement from the previous three years, as they lost 6 games by 12 points or less and finished 12th for the second year running. They were the first team to be beaten by the Gold Coast in the season, having led by ten points with less than a minute remaining, the Tigers produced what former Sydney Swans coach Paul Roos labelled "the worst 47 seconds in footy" to lose by two points.  They did, however, defeat both of the eventual grand finalists Hawthorn and Sydney during the season, the only team to do so the entire year. , 2013 saw the Tigers produce their best season in twelve years, with the club qualifying for its first finals series since 2001 and just its third since 1982.   They were also one of only two teams to defeat the eventual premiers, Hawthorn , during the season. Richmond, however, were defeated by Carlton in the first elimination final, 18.8 (116) to 14.12 (96), and bowed out of the finals series. The crowd of 94,690 is the largest week-one final crowd since the AFL changed from a final four in 1972.  , Also in 2013, Peggy O'Neal , an American-born lawyer, became the first woman in the Australian Football League to hold the position of club president when she was chosen as the president of the Richmond Football Club.  , After finally breaking their finals drought the previous year, many believed the tigers would build on this success in 2014 and push for a top-four berth. Any hope of this happening all but disappeared when the Tigers fell to a record of 3-10 after Round 14. Despite this, a victory in round 15 initiated a nine match winning sequence to slip them in to eighth position on the ladder and claim consecutive finals appearances for the first time since 1975. A 57-point loss in their elimination final against Port Adelaide, ended their finals campaign abruptly in the first week of finals, for the second year in a row.  , Initially, Richmond saw itself as a gentlemanly and sportsman-like club; it even went to the extent of sacking a player who used poor language. During the early 1900s, the club used the press as a forum to publicise a campaign against violence in the game, which earned the derision of some rival clubs. This image followed the club into the VFL in 1908 and during the First World War the club emphasised the number of men associated with the club who had enlisted and served overseas. But the club's actions in 1916, when it voted with three other clubs seen as representative of the working class ( Collingwood , Fitzroy and Carlton ) to continue playing football, left no doubt as to which side of the class divide that the Tigers belonged. The club's self-consciously non-confrontational image can be partly attributed to two of long serving presidents— George Bennett (1887–1908) and Frank Tudor (1909–1918). Both were Richmond men and respected parliamentarians who took the view that how the game was played was more important than whether the game was won. , After World War I, the club's attitude hardened as they attempted to match it with the then power clubs Collingwood and Carlton. Eventually, the Tigers became more prosaic in their approach to recruiting and training. , The Hafey era transformed Richmond into one of the most feared combinations in the then VFL. The club's football administrator, Graham Richmond, drove the "win at all costs" mentality across the whole club, making Richmond a formidable force, winning five premierships from 1967 to 1980. , Since the Tigers' last grand final appearance in 1982, the club has appeared in four finals series(1995, 2001, 2013, 2014). Board and coaching instability during the 1980s and 1990s distracted the club and forced its focus away from becoming an onfield force. , The club's current home jumper is black, which features a yellow sash running from the top left of the jumper to the bottom right. In its first season, Richmond wore a blue jumper with a thin yellow-and-black sash running from right to left. In 2007, the club introduced a clash jumper to avoid a jumper clash with rival AFL team Essendon. It is similar to the current home jumper, but features a yellow collar, yellow side panels and a large white number box on the back of the guernsey. Since the 2014 season, the club guernsey's have been manufactured by sportswear company BLK  and features logos of its major sponsors Bingle and Jeep . , Jack Malcolmson is credited with writing the words to the song in 1962, adapting them to the tune of "Row, Row, Row" ( Monaco / Jerome ), a show tune from the Ziegfeld Follies of 1912 . Richmond were using words sung to the tune of Waltzing Matilda at the time and approached Malcolmson, a cabaret singer who was performing regularly at the Richmond Football Club Social Club, to write the lyrics. The current version of the song used by the club is a 1972 recording performed by the Fable Singers.  , Richmond's club mascot is called Tiger "Stripes" Dyer, named after AFL legend Jack "Captain Blood" Dyer . , The club's home ground is the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) where the team plays most of their home matches in the regular season. , The MCG has a capacity of 100,000 and the club usually draws large attendances against Victorian clubs, particularly rivals such as Essendon , Collingwood and Carlton . , Richmond train at their home ground, the Punt Road Oval , which is located a few hundred metres from the MCG. , Club administration since 1908  , Richmond has an enormous support and is known for its dedicated fan-base, including its personal cheer squad who attended both home and away matches, for the club. Membership record for the club hit 69,000 in 2015 making it one of the most supported clubs in the Australian Football League . , The building of the fan base was a slow process for Richmond. In the 1890s, the club never sold more than three hundred season's tickets, but the following was built up with success in the VFA and membership numbered about 2,000 at the time of admission to the VFL in 1908. Between the wars, the club captured the imagination of the residents of Richmond . The successful Tigers were a positive motif for the oppressed working class community which suffered deprivation during the Great Depression . At this time, the Richmond community was almost half Catholic, and this demographic was reflected in the club amongst the players and officials. , As Melbourne dramatically spread out in the post-war years, so too did the Richmond supporters. Many were now concentrated in the eastern suburbs, which eventually formed the club's metropolitan recruiting zone. Indeed, at one point during the early development of the Waverley Park ground, the Tigers considered making the stadium its home for this reason. Following the barren period of the 1950s, Richmond was able to tap into the large number of fans by moving home matches to the MCG and almost doubled attendance figures. The Tigers maintained this advantage over the other clubs until the mid-1980s, when poor administration led to a downturn in every area of the club. As the club struggled for funds, the membership plummeted from over 10,000 to under 3,000. , The greatest display of loyalty from the fans occurred during 1990. Threatened by liquidation, the supporters rallied to pay off the multi-million dollar debt via the " Save Our Skins " campaign.  In 2011, the club launched the Fighting Tiger Fund to reduce the club's debt and to allow it to increase spending on the football department in order to be more competitive on field.  , In 2013, the club launched the The Roar is Back membership promotion aiming at signing up 60,000 members in a season for the first time ever. Following a successful campaign, on 24 June 2013, Richmond chief executive Brendon Gale confirmed that membership had passed 60,000.   The club created a limited edition commemorative Sherrin football to celebrate the achievement and it was distributed free to families at the 'Thank you for 60,000 members BBQ/Training Morning' at Punt Road Oval on 29 June 2013. The official membership total for 2013 was 60,321.  , For statistical purposes 30 June is the cut-off date for membership numbers although it does continue to sell memberships. In 2013, after 30 June the club commenced bundling 2013 and 2014 membership years into a special "Sign up as a member for 2014 and get the rest of 2013 free!" offer.  The 2014 membership total of 66,122  gave Richmond the 3rd biggest membership base in the AFL behind Collingwood and Hawthorn (80,793 and 68,650 respectively). This record was again broken in 2015 with the club signing up 69,005 members, still ranking 3rd in total membership numbers. , The Official Richmond Cheer Squad is an organised group of passionate supporters who attend every Richmond game whether in Melbourne or interstate. There are also supporter groups located in each state of Australia.  , In 1998, Richmond announced its Team of the 20th Century. The selection of the 22 players shows an even spread of champions from all the eras of the club: Thorp from the club's first premiership wins of 1920–21; McCormack, Strang, Titus and Dyer from the inter-war years; Rowe, Morris and Wright from the battling era after the war; Richardson and Knights from recent times. But the great days from the late 1960s to the early 1980s provide the bulk of the side: Sheedy, Green, Keane, Bourke, Barrot, Clay, Hart, Dean and Bartlett who made up the core of Tom Hafey's teams, and later success stories Weightman and Raines. Ian Stewart, named on the bench, created a record as the only man to win selection in a team of the century at two clubs—he was named in the centre of St Kilda's team as well. Richmond has four players denoted below with an asterisk who are also members of AFL Team of the Century . This is the second-most of any club. , Played 248 Won 173 Lost 73 Drawn 2 , [1] , As legends of the game: , As players of the game: , As coaches of the game: , The club's hall of fame was created in 2002 with 23 inductees. Below is a list, separated into categories, of members and the year they were inducted. So far, five Richmond " Immortals " have been named, the first of whom was Jack Dyer , the year before his death in 2003. Dyer was followed by Kevin Bartlett , Tom Hafey , Francis Bourke and Royce Hart . , [2] , During the centenary season the tigers announced their 100 Tiger Treasures consisting of 10 awards, each with 10 nominees given by the Richmond Football Club in 2008 to celebrate their centenary year of competition in the VFL/AFL . The awards were mostly given to players but also club moments and campaigns. On Saturday, 28 June Richmond held a centenary celebration at Punt Road Oval before the centenary game at the MCG against arch rivials Carlton later that day. , "Put his unique stamp on the 1980 finals series , kicking 21 goals as a half-forward in Richmond's three appearances, including a Grand Final-equalling bag of seven in the Grand Final massacre of the Magpies , which earned him the Norm Smith Medal for being best afield." , "Thrilled Tiger fans for a decade with his match-winning exploits at centre half-forward. His dominance up forward was a major factor in the Club's run of four premierships from 1967–74. He was an extraordinary mark, a deadeye shot for goal, very courageous and, when the ball hit the ground, he swooped on it like a rover." , "No player in the history of the game epitomises his club more than the man known as 'Captain Blood'. He struck fear into the hearts and minds of all opposition players during the 1930s and 40s. Was renowned for his bone-jarring shirtfronts, which left many an opponent bloodied, battered and bruised. He bled for the Tigers and expected his teammates to do likewise." , "On 15 August 1990, Richmond announced that it needed to raise $1 million by 31 October that year, or it would cease to exist. The Save Our Skins campaign was immediately established to keep the Tigers alive. With Club president Neville Crowe as the figurehead, the SOS campaign did exactly what it set out to achieve, raising the necessary funds to stave off the threat of extinction." , "Graeme Richmond filled a variety of important roles at Tigerland over more than 30 years of devoted service. He was a shrewd, ruthless administrator, who never wasted an opportunity that could benefit his beloved Tigers. His strength lay in his relentless persuasiveness—he was a masterly recruiter and negotiator. And, as a speaker, arguably there have been none finer in league football history." , "Bourke collided with teammate Stephen Mount in a tense Round 21, 1980 clash with North Melbourne at Arden Street and had trouble seeing because of the blood streaming down his face. He was subsequently moved from full-back to the opposite end of the ground, where he immediately made his presence felt, taking a diving chest mark and slotting through a crucial goal." , "Richmond, under coach Tommy Hafey , finished the 1967 home-and-away season on top. The Tigers disposed of Carlton by 40 points in the second-semi, then faced up to a star-studded Geelong combination in the Grand Final . At the end of a spectacular contest, Richmond had broken a 24-year premiership drought. Barrot , Brown , Hart , Dean and Bartlett starred, while unsung hero Ronaldson kicked three vital goals." , "The superstar full-forward was a noted high-flyer during his 200-game career at Tigerland, but the mark he took against Hawthorn at the MCG in 1979 was, almost literally, out of this world. 'Roachy' actually rose so high over a huge nest of Hawk players, he ended up making it a chest mark!" , "The little Tiger excitement machine decided to take off on a bit of a trot during the team's final home-and-away match of the 1990 season , against Sydney at the SCG . After gathering the ball deep in defence, 'Mitch' took one bounce, then another, and then five more (seven in total), before calmly drilling home an incredibly inspirational goal." , "On 18 May 1974, all hell broke loose at half-time of Richmond's clash with Essendon at Windy Hill as the players were leaving the field . . . A massive brawl erupted, involving players and officials of both clubs. Following a league investigation, several players and officials received suspensions, the heaviest being for Graeme Richmond , who was rubbed out until 31 December and also fined $2000." , As of 4 December 2014: , Head coach , Assistant coaches , First Awarded 1924 , First Awarded 1897 , * Michael Roach was the first winner of the Coleman Medal in 1981. Retrospective awards were dated back to 1955. Prior to 1955 the Leading Goalkicker Medal was awarded. , First Awarded 1993 , First Awarded 1979 , Awarded 1937 to 1988 , Commenced 1953 , Commenced 1998 , Richmond has had a reserves team participate in various competitions since the early 20th century. The reserves competition for the then-Victorian Football League (now trading as the Australian Football League ) began in 1919 and the Richmond reserves recorded its first premiership in 1929. In the following 68 years, Richmond went on to win a further eight premierships in reserve-grade football.  The Richmond reserves participated in the VFL/AFL reserves, then the Victorian State Football League up to the 1999 season, then in the new Victorian Football League competition in 2000 . , In 2001, the Richmond reserves team was dissolved and the club entered a reserves affiliation with the Coburg Football Club in the VFL, using the latter as a feeder team. This arrangement lasted from 2001 until 2013.  Richmond ended the affiliation at the end of 2013, seeking to re-establish a more direct developmental structure by operating a stand-alone reserves team.  The reformed Richmond reserves team has played in the VFL since 2014, playing most its home games at the Punt Road Oval , with many as curtain raisers to the club's senior home and away games at the nearby Melbourne Cricket Ground .   The St Kilda Football Club , nicknamed The Saints , is an Australian rules football club based in Melbourne , Victoria , Australia . The club plays in the Australian Football League , the sport's premier league. , The club's name originates from the bayside Melbourne suburb of St Kilda in which the club was established in 1873. , St Kilda were a foundation team of the Victorian Football Association (VFA) in 1877 and later, in 1897, became a foundation team in the Victorian Football League (VFL), which was renamed the Australian Football League (AFL) prior to the start of the 1990 season.  , St Kilda have only won a single premiership to date, a famous one-point win in the 1966 VFL Grand Final .  St Kilda have most recently won the minor premiership of the 2009 AFL season  and were 2009 and 2010 grand finalists. , St Kilda developed a reputation as perennial underachievers,  much of this attributed to their record of finishing last more often than any other club in the league (27 times),  as well as having the third lowest all-time win percentage of any team still playing in the league.  , , , The St Kilda Football Club was formed on 2 April 1873,  containing many elements of the previous South Yarra Football Club which had disbanded a year earlier. Soon after a decision was made to amalgamate St Kilda FC with nearby Prahran Football Club. St Kilda retained their colours, name and ground, as well as picking up a number of Prahran players.  St Kilda competed as a senior club in the VFA from 1877 to 1879, 1881–1882 and 1886–1896 before moving into the breakaway competition – The Victorian Football League – from 1897 onwards.  , St Kilda were one of the eight clubs that took part in the inaugural VFL season in 1897. They made their debut in an away game against Collingwood on 8 May 1897, which they lost 2.4. (16) to 5.11. (41). , The club's home ground in the new league was the Junction Oval ( until 1964 ) in the suburb of St Kilda in Melbourne and the club's first home game was against Fitzroy . The score was St Kilda 3.8. (26) to 10.6. (66). , St Kilda's early years in the VFL were not successful and, in 1899, they had the lowest score ever recorded in a VFL/AFL match, one point against Geelong (who scored 162).  , In 1902, Charlie Baker became the first St Kilda player to be the league's leading goalkicker in a home and away season with 30 goals. , Six successive wins at the start of the 1907 season saw St Kilda make the finals for the first time, qualifying third with nine wins and eight losses. , St Kilda were beaten by Carlton in their first VFL final by 56 points. They qualified in third position again in 1908 and were once again eliminated by Carlton in the semi-finals, this time by 58 points. , The 1913 season saw major improvement in which the team qualified fourth, but were eventually beaten in the 1913 grand final by Fitzroy. At the time a challenge system was in place, which allowed the team that qualified in first position as minor premiers to challenge any team that won through to be the top ranked team in the finals series if it was not the minor premiers. St Kilda won its semi-final against South Melbourne and then defeated Fitzroy two weeks later 10.10. (70) to 6.9. (45) in what was a match between the two teams that won the semi-finals. Fitzroy as minor premiers were allowed to challenge St Kilda – the number one ranked team in the finals series at that point – and the two teams played again the following week in the grand final which Fitzroy won 7.14.(56) to 5.13.(43). , Due to World War I the St Kilda Football Club was in recess in 1916 and 1917 but resumed in 1918 and fared well, making the finals in fourth position but were eliminated by Collingwood in a semi final by nine points, 58 to 49. , Colin Watson became the first St Kilda player to win the league's highest individual award, the Brownlow Medal . , The following years saw St Kilda establish itself as a more consistently competitive club. They made the finals in 1929 and were eliminated once again by Carlton , 12.9 (81) to 11.7, (73) in the semi-finals. , In 1936, Bill Mohr became the second St Kilda player to be the league's leading goalkicker in a home and away season. , Bill Mohr kicked 101 goals in 1936 and was the first St Kilda player to kick 100 goals or more in a season. , The mid-1930s saw the club consistently vying for finals berths, finally making it in 1939 by qualifying fourth after a record run of eight consecutive victories and an overall record of 13 wins and five losses.  The team had its first finals win since 1913, against Richmond , but were eliminated in the 1939 finals series by Collingwood in the preliminary final. , St Kilda won three of the first four games early in the 1940 season and were on top of the ladder after Round 4 before finishing second last. Although there were some prominent players like Harold Bray , Keith Drinan , Peter Bennett and later Neil Roberts , St Kilda were rarely competitive in the 1940s. The 1950 season saw St Kilda win the first five games before fading to finish with eight wins and a draw in ninth place. In 1955, after one of the club's worst seasons, Alan Killigrew was appointed coach. His first action was one of the largest clean-outs of players in the history of any VFL club. It is believed that only 17 players from 1955 played for St Kilda again in 1956, with 11 new players appearing in the club's opening match of 1956. , In 1956 Bill Young became the third St Kilda player to be the league's leading goalkicker in a home and away season with 56 goals. , In 1957, Brian Gleeson became the second St Kilda player to win the league's highest individual award, the Brownlow Medal. , In 1958, Neil Roberts became the third St Kilda player to win the Brownlow Medal. , Also in 1958 St Kilda won the Consolation Night Series competition , a competition that was played between clubs that had failed to qualify for the premiership season finals series. St Kilda defeated Carlton 16.13 (109) to 15.11 (101) in the final. , In 1959, Verdun Howell became the fourth St Kilda player to win the Brownlow Medal. , Howell tied with Bob Skilton in the 1959 Brownlow Medal count. At the time Skilton was awarded the medal on count-back. The league later decided to award a Brownlow Medal to any player who was eligible to win who tied on the same number of votes as a winner who won on count-back – with Verdun Howell receiving a Brownlow retrospectively. , In 1961, after finishing sixth in 1960, Allan Jeans was appointed coach. St Kilda qualified for the final four for the first time since 1939, qualifying third with eleven wins and seven losses. However, with fullback Verdun Howell unfit, the club lost to Footscray in the first semi-final. The club finished ninth in 1962 with nine wins and nine losses. , In 1964, St Kilda were defeated in the final of the Consolation Night Series competition by Footscray 11.12 (78) to 11.7 (73). , St Kilda had a convincing sequence of six consecutive wins in the last six rounds of the 1963 season to qualify in fourth position with 13 wins (52 premiership points), two premiership points behind minor premiers Hawthorn . The club lost to Melbourne in the semi-finals. , By the late 1950s, the St Kilda Football Club was seeking to move its playing base away from the Junction Oval , frustrated by disputes and relationships with the St Kilda Cricket Club . In 1959, the club made enquiries about a 50-year lease to play at and develop Elsternwick Park in the neighbouring suburb of Elsternwick , but no deal was signed.  In March 1964, the club arranged a deal to move its training and administrative base to the large Moorabbin Oval in Linton St, Moorabbin , approximately 10 km south-east of St Kilda, starting from the 1965 season .  The club signed a 75-year lease in August 1964 for controlling occupancy of the venue, and established a social club on the site.  The move cost the local Moorabbin Football Club its place in the Victorian Football Association .  , St Kilda's final home game for premiership points at the Junction Oval was the Round 18 match on 22 August 1964 against Geelong , which St Kilda won 12.18 (90) to 11.12 (78) in front of a crowd of 37,100.  Its first home game at Moorabbin was a 6-point win over Collingwood 8.12 (60) d. 8.6 (54) in front of a crowd of 51,370, which is still the ground record for Moorabbin Oval.  , St Kilda finished the home and away season a game clear on top with 14 wins and 4 losses, qualifying for a finals series in first position as minor premiers for the first time in the club's history. , St Kilda defeated Collingwood in the second semi-final to progress into the grand final. The club finished second in the 1965 premiership season after being beaten by Essendon 14.21 (105) to 9.16 (70) in the 1965 VFL Grand Final . , Ian Stewart became the fifth St Kilda player to win the Brownlow Medal. Stewart tied on votes with Noel Teasdale of North Melbourne and was awarded the 1965 Brownlow on a count-back. , 1966 saw St Kilda qualify for finals series in consecutive years for the first time since 1907–08. 14 wins and 4 losses in the home and away rounds qualified the club for the finals in second place. , Ian Stewart was the first St Kilda player in history to become a dual Brownlow Medalist after winning the 1966 Brownlow Medal with 21 votes. The second consecutive year he won the league's highest individual award and the sixth Brownlow Medal won by a St Kilda player. , St Kilda were defeated by Collingwood in the second semi-final 15. 9. (99) to 13. 11. (89). The club progressed to the 1966 Grand Final after defeating Essendon in the preliminary final 15. 4. (94) to 7. 10. (52). , St Kilda went on to defeat Collingwood in the 1966 VFL Grand Final 10.14 (74) to 10.13 (73), winning the club's first ever premiership. , in 1967, Ross Smith became the sixth player St Kilda player to win Brownlow Medal. This was also the third consecutive year that a St Kilda player had won the Brownlow Medal and the second time in the club's history that they had Brownlow Medalists in three consecutive years. , The 1968 season saw St Kilda qualify fourth with 14 wins, 5 losses and a draw. St Kilda were eliminated by Geelong in the first semi-final. , A seventh place home and away season finish in 1969 was followed by another finals appearance in 1970 , when St Kilda qualified in third place with 14 wins and 8 losses. St Kilda defeated South Melbourne in the first semifinal and went on to be eliminated by eventual premiers Carlton in the preliminary final. , St Kilda qualified for the finals series in second place in 1971 at the end of the home and away season with 16 wins. St Kilda was defeated by Hawthorn by two points in the second semifinal, defeated Richmond in the preliminary final and was defeated in the 1971 VFL Grand Final by Hawthorn. , The club qualified for the finals series again in 1972 in fourth with 14 wins and 8 losses. St Kilda defeated Essendon in the elimination final and Collingwood in the first semifinal before being eliminated in the preliminary final by Carlton. , 1973 saw the club qualify for a record fourth consecutive finals series in fifth place with 12 wins. St Kilda defeated Essendon in the elimination final before being eliminated in the semifinals by Richmond. , 1974 saw the Saints decline to the lower half of the ladder for the first time since the 1950s, finishing tenth with seven wins. The club failed to build on competitive seasons in 1975 and 1976 . Allan Jeans coaching career at St Kilda ended at the end of the 1976 season after 16 seasons. , 1978 began and ended strongly, but a mid-season slump saw the club narrowly miss the finals. 1979 began well with a win over Hawthorn before a run of defeats and finishing a clear last. Continuing financial pressures and defeats saw the club remain in the bottom three for every season from 1979 to 1986. , In 1987 , with Tony Lockett at full forward, St Kilda moved out of the bottom three for the first time since 1982 with nine wins. Tony Lockett won the Coleman Medal for leading goalkicker in the home and away season, the fourth St Kilda player to win the league's leading goalkicker award. Lockett became the second St Kilda player to kick more than 100 goals in a season (117). , Lockett also became the seventh St Kilda player to win the Brownlow Medal . He remains the only person in league history to win both the league's best and fairest Brownlow Medal and the league's leading goalkicker Coleman Medal award in the same season. Lockett also won St Kilda's best and fairest award, now called the Trevor Barker Award , and the Leigh Matthews Trophy (players association most valuable player) in the same year. He is the only person in league history to win the Brownlow, Coleman, club best and fairest and Leigh Matthews Trophy in the same year in 1987. , The league was officially renamed the Australian Football League prior to the start of the 1990 premiership season. , A competitive 1991 AFL season saw St Kilda qualify for a finals series for the first time since 1973, qualifying fourth at the end of the home and away rounds. St Kilda were defeated by Geelong in the elimination final. , Tony Lockett won the Coleman Medal for leading goalkicker in the home and away season in 1991, the first St Kilda player to win the league's leading goalkicker twice. , Lockett's 118 goals in 1991 was the third year a St Kilda player had kicked more than 100 goals in a season. , In a competitive 1992 season , St Kilda again qualified for the finals series, qualifying sixth at the end of the home and away rounds. Tony Lockett's 132 goals in 1992 was the fourth year a St Kilda player kicked more than 100 goals in a season. , St Kilda won its first finals series match since 1973, over Collingwood, before being by eliminated from the 1992 finals series by Footscray in the semi-finals. , The AFL embarked on a strategy of grounds rationalisation in the early 1990s and, with Moorabbin Oval's facilities ageing, St Kilda opted to take a deal to move home games to Waverley Park from 1993. The club voted in favour of the move in a weighted vote of members and shareholders by a margin of 8750 to 6555 in July 1992. The club received $430,000 upfront and $120,000 per year for three years from the AFL's grounds rationalisation funds, which helped to clear some of the club's debt.  St Kilda's final home game for premiership points at Moorabbin Oval was the Round 20 match on 1 August 1992, an 18 point win over the Fitzroy Lions in front of 27,736.  St Kilda Football Club retained Moorabbin Oval as a training, administration and entertainment venue. , St Kilda won the 1996 Ansett Australia Cup competition, the pre-season cup. The team had wins over Hawthorn in the round of 16, Adelaide in the quarter finals, West Coast in the semi-finals and defeated Carlton in the final 20.10 (130) to 10.12 (72) in front of 66,888 people at Waverley Park. , Nicky Winmar became the first St Kilda player to win the Michael Tuck Medal for best player on the ground in the 1996 Ansett Australia Cup Final.   , In the 1997 season , St Kilda qualified for the finals series in first position at the end of the home and away rounds with 15 wins and 7 losses, winning a second minor premiership and the first McClelland Trophy in the club's history. , Robert Harvey became the eighth St Kilda player to win the Brownlow Medal . , St Kilda defeated Brisbane in the qualifying finals and North Melbourne in the preliminary finals to move through to the grand final.

At the half-way mark of the 1998 season, St Kilda had jumped to top spot on the ladder in Round 14 with eleven wins and three losses after defeating the Western Bulldogs in a top of the ladder clash at Waverley Park and were tipped as warm favourites for the premiership. However, the team's performance dramatically faded after going from second place in Round 17 to sixth at the home and away games conclusion in Round 22. During this period St Kilda defeated Geelong in Round 16 and West Coast in Round 21. After qualifying for the finals in consecutive seasons, St Kilda were defeated narrowly by Sydney in the qualifying finals and then eliminated comprehensively by Melbourne in the semi-finals. Consolation for the team's performance that year was Robert Harvey becoming the second St Kilda player in history to become a dual Brownlow Medalist after winning the 1998 Brownlow Medal with 32 votes, the highest ever votes at the time. He would also be the second St Kilda player to win consecutive Brownlow Medals and the tenth St Kilda Brownlow Medalist. , St Kilda made a good start to the 1999 premiership season after progressing to the top four in Round 10. Their form, however, then faded and by the season's end conclusion they would finish 10th on the ladder. St Kilda's final home game for premiership points at Waverley Park was the Round 20 match on 14 August 1999, a 25 point loss to North Melbourne which ended their chance at a third consecutive finals campaign in a row since 1997.  , In 2000, St Kilda moved to a new playing home at Docklands Stadium (currently known by its sponsorship name as Etihad Stadium) whilst maintaining the club's training and administration headquarters at Moorabbin. , The Saints struggled in the early part of this decade, winning only two matches and drawing one to finish with the wooden spoon in 2000 . They did not fare well in 2001 or 2002 either, finishing second-last in both seasons; the time spent at the bottom allowed St Kilda to recruit players such as Justin Koschitzke , Nick Riewoldt , Nick Dal Santo and Brendon Goddard , who were mainstays of the team over the following decade. The 2003 season saw a much improved Saints outfit, finishing 11th at the season's end.

St Kilda were defeated by Geelong in the qualifying finals,  defeated Collingwood in the semi-finals  and were eliminated by the eventual premiers, Hawthorn, in the preliminary final.  , St Kilda were eliminated from the 2009 NAB Cup by Brisbane in the opening round.  , St Kilda won the first 19 games of the 2009 season, breaking the club record of 10 successive wins which was set in the first 10 games of the 2004 season. The winning streak was brought to end by Essendon in Round 20 when they defeated the Saints by two points. An after-the-siren shot at goal which would have won the game for St Kilda was missed by Nick Riewoldt .  , In Round 14, on 5 July, St Kilda played the premiership favourites Geelong, a club they had not beaten since 2006. Both teams were undefeated prior to the round 14 clash. St Kilda defeated Geelong by six points.  The game broke many records including highest ever crowd for an AFL match at Docklands Stadium (54,444)  as well as the latest round in a season that two undefeated teams had met (the previous record was in Round 8, 1991 when West Coast played Essendon after being unbeaten).

In the club's early years, from 1873 to 1896, the players wore a thinly striped red, white and black jumper; the stripes were later widened. In 1915, St Kilda changed its colours to red, yellow and black, because red, white and black were the national colours of the German Empire during the First World War . These colours were long associated with republicanism in Germany and were later revived as the flag of the inter war Weimar Republic and later the post WWII German Federal Republic. , In 1923 the club returned to using the club's original colours of red, white and black. The club crest first appeared on the jumper in approximately 1933. In 1953 the Saints' jumper took the look of the three stripes; red, white and black which have been used up until today, except for a period from 1997 to 2001 in which a stylised jumper based on the club crest was worn.  , 1873–1896 , 1915–1918 , 1919–1922 , 1923–1952 , 1953–1959 , 1997–2001 , 2002–2010 , 2011- , The St Kilda jumper is three vertical stripes of red, white and black on the front with the club crest. The back is black with white numbers. The current jumper sponsor is Dare Iced Coffee, whose logo appears on the front of the uniform. LEDified appears on the back. The clash jumper is very distinct from the home jumper, bearing red, white and black vertical stripes with a white back, with sponsor positions reversed. , The club has used many logos since it was formed in 1873 for promotional and merchandise purposes. The league did not use official club logos until approximately the 1970s. Prior to the 1970s logos were generally created by clubs and in some cases outside companies for sales of merchandise but were in no way official ( or registered trademarks in some cases ). In the past all the club logos were printed in the same basic design frame ( in the form of a badge or shield shape ) and had each clubs individual colours, name and design in them. St Kilda used several different logos, including some featuring the stick figure in the 1980s and 1990s. Shortly after the league officially changed its name to the AFL prior to the start of the 1990 premiership season, the club used a logo with a red white and black vertically striped design with the goal and behind posts on it, with a stick figure attempting a mark on it with a halo above its head, with the league logo and the club crest on top of either behind post. , A logo change before the start of the 1995 season saw the club make the decision to use the official club crest - which has been on the club jumper since it was first designed in the 1930s and was already an officially registered trade mark of the club - as the club's official logo in the league. The crest is an iconic feature of the club's jumper - a well-known and recognisable symbol of the club. The crest also includes the club's motto, Fortius Quo Fidelius , which is usually translated as "Strength through loyalty". As with the nickname "Saints" the club crest has no religious associations. , The club song is based on the music of the song "When The Saints Go Marching In".  The official club song, "When The Saints Go Marching In", was recorded in 1972 by the Fable Singers and released as a single. The song was recorded will all copyright and royalty agreements in place and the AFL has permission to broadcast it publicly at each St Kilda match.  , Until 1964, when St Kilda played at the Junction Oval, the club song at every match was an adaptation of "I Do Like To Be Beside The Seaside". When the club moved to Moorabbin Oval a popular chant called "We are the Saints" was sung by supporters. In the late 1960s "When The Saints Go Marching In" eventually became established as the club song. The tune is used by permission under licence. , The club's training and administration base remained at Moorabbin Oval after home games ceased being played there. The club's final home game for premiership points at Moorabbin Oval was in Round 20, 1992. , Moorabbin Oval was extensively renovated to provide training, administration and entertainment facilities within the Huggins Stand and a heritage museum. Moorabbin Oval remains part of the club's training, administration and entertainment base. The G.G. Huggins Stand has three internal floors that contain player rooms, a fully equipped player gymnasium, football department meeting rooms, administration offices, a membership department, gaming room and bar, the Trevor Barker Room (a function room with a bar), club shop, trophy and memorabilia display areas and other facilities. , In 2010 construction was completed on a new additional training and administration property at Seaford in the City Of Frankston, approximately 21 kilometres from Moorabbin Oval. The new facilities were completed a cost of approximately 9.5 million dollars and was named the Linen House Centre under a naming rights sponsorship deal. , Grand Finals (7) , Finalists (26) , Head coach , Assistant coaches , An individual player award under various headings such as "champion player" and later "best and fairest" has been made since about 1914. In the late 1990s the club named the award the Trevor Barker Award to honour the name and memory of Trevor Barker , a former St Kilda player and reserves coach.  , The person who has won the most St Kilda best and fairest awards: , The Brownlow Medal is awarded to the " best and fairest " player in the Australian Football League (AFL) during the regular season (i.e., not including finals matches) as determined by votes cast by the officiating umpires after each game. It is the most prestigious award for individual players in the AFL. It is also widely acknowledged as the highest individual honour in the sport of Australian rules football . , Since 1992, the Michael Tuck Medal has been awarded to the player adjudged best on ground during the AFL Cup Final held before the Premiership season begins each year. Three St Kilda Football Club players have won it. , The Leigh Matthews Trophy is awarded by the AFL Players Association to the player voted the most valuable during the year, the award has been given out ever since Leigh Matthews first won it in 1982. , The Coleman Medal is awarded to the leading goal scorer in the league in the home and away season. Prior to 1955 the league's leading goal scorer was awarded the Leading Goalkicker Medal . , The AFL Rising Star award is given to a young player considered to have significantly improved during the year. Every round, an Australian Football League rising star nomination is given to a standout young player. To be eligible for the award, a player must be under 21 on 1 January of that year, have played 10 or fewer senior games before the beginning of the season, and not have been suspended during the season. , The Australian Football Hall of Fame was established in 1996, the centenary year of the Australian Football League , to help recognise the contributions made to the sport of Australian rules football by players, umpires, media personalities, coaches and administrators.  As of 2015, the following sixteen former players and coaches who served at least part of their career at St Kilda have been inducted into the AFL's Hall of Fame , with five players elevated to the top status of 'Legend', reserved for approximately 10% of the total Hall of Fame. , St Kilda Football Club's Hall of Fame was established in 2003. , Club identities, past or present, are selected and inducted into the club's hall of fame by a St Kilda Football Club Hall of Fame committee.  , At each gala event, at least one inductee is selected to be elevated to club legend status. , St Kilda's most recent Hall of Fame induction was held in the Palladium at Crown Casino in Melbourne on 24 July 2010 with three new inductees added.  , The St Kilda Football Club Hall of Fame committee for 2010 featured Ross Smith, Greg Westaway, John Beveridge, Russell Holmesby, Neil Roberts, Allan Jeans and Danny Frawley. , Previous inductions were held in 2003, 2007 and 2008, with 13 identities inducted in 2003, 12 in 2007 and 12 in 2008. , 2003 Inductees , 2007 Inductees , , 2008 Inductees , 2010 Inductees , At a special function in 2003 the St Kilda Football Club Team of the Century  was announced. Darrel Baldock, who captained the 1966 grand final team, was named as captain and Allan Jeans, who coached St Kilda for a record 17 years, was named as coach. Ian Stewart was also named a member of the AFL Team of the Century . , , Actor Eric Bana , music business identity Ian "Molly" Meldrum and cricketer Shane Warne are prominent supporters of the club.  , St Kilda's official membership figures 1984-2013  , St Kilda operated its own reserves team from 1919 to 2000. From 1919 to 1991 the VFL/AFL operated a reserves competition and, from 1992 to 1999, a de facto AFL reserves competition was run by the Victorian State Football League . St Kilda fielded a reserves team in both of these competitions, allowing players who were not selected for the senior team to play for St Kilda in the lower grade. During that time, the St Kilda reserves team won three premierships (1942, 1943 and 1961). Following the demise of the AFL reserves competition, the St Kilda reserves team competed in the new Victorian Football League in the 2000 season before the team was dissolved at the end of the year. , In 2001, St Kilda entered a reserves affiliation with existing VFL club Springvale (which moved to Cranbourne and was renamed Casey in 2006). Under the affiliation, reserves players for St Kilda played VFL football with Springvale/Casey. The affiliation ended after the 2008 season  and St Kilda then entered an equivalent affiliation with Sandringham which it still maintains as of the 2015 season.  , St Kilda plans to end its affiliation with Sandringham and re-establish its own reserves team in the VFL in the near future, currently expected to be from the 2017 season after a redevelopment of Moorabbin Oval is completed.  ,  The Sydney Swans is an Australian rules football club which plays in the Australian Football League (AFL). The club has been based in Sydney , New South Wales since the South Melbourne Football Club was relocated to Sydney in 1982. Sydney was the first club in the competition to be based outside Victoria . The Swans play most home games at the Sydney Cricket Ground , while local derbies and larger games against teams such as Collingwood are played at ANZ Stadium . , Since 1995, the Sydney Swans have made the finals more years than any other club in the same period [ citation needed ] , only missing the finals in 2000, 2002 and 2009. , The South Melbourne Football Club was founded in 1874 and was strong through the 1880s. It won three premierships in 1909 , 1918 and 1933 before experiencing 72 years without a premiership, the longest premiership drought of any club. The club broke the drought in 2005,  and has won one more premiership since, in 2012 . , , , The inauguration date of the club is officially 19 June 1874, and it adopted the name "South Melbourne Football Club" four weeks later, on 15 July.  In 1880, South Melbourne amalgamated with the nearby Albert-park Football Club , which had a senior football history dating back to May 1867 (Albert-park had, in fact, been known as South Melbourne during its first year of existence).   Following the amalgamation, the club retained the name South Melbourne, and adopted the club's now familiar red and white colours from Albert-park.  Nicknamed the “Southerners”, the team was more colourfully known as the “Bloods", in reference to the bright red sash on their white jumpers   (the sash was replaced with a red “V” in 1932).  The colorful epithet the “Bloodstained Angels” was also in use. The club was based at Lake Oval , also home of the South Melbourne Cricket Club . , South Melbourne was a junior foundation club of the Victorian Football Association in 1877, and attained senior status in 1879;  the club amalgamated with the neighbouring Albert-park Football Club in 1880, forming a club which immediately became the strongest in metropolitan Melbourne.  Over its first decade as an amalgamated club, South Melbourne won five VFA premierships – in 1881, 1885 (undefeated), and three-in-a-row in 1888, 1889 and 1890 – and was runner-up to the provincial Geelong Football Club in 1880, 1883 and 1886. , At the end of the 1896 season, Collingwood and South Melbourne finished equal at the top of the VFA's premiership ladder with records of 14–3–1, requiring a playoff match to determine the season's premiership; this was the first time this had occurred in VFA history.  The match took place on 3 October 1896 at the East Melbourne Cricket Ground . Collingwood won the match, six goals to five, in front of an estimated crowd of 12,000.  , This Grand Final would be the last match South Melbourne would play in the VFA, as the following season they would be one of eight founding clubs forming the breakaway Victorian Football League . The other clubs were St Kilda Football Club , Essendon Football Club , Fitzroy Football Club , Melbourne Football Club , Geelong Football Club , Carlton Football Club and Collingwood Football Club . , South Melbourne was one of the original founding clubs of the Victorian Football League that was formed in 1897. , The club had early success and won three VFL premierships in 1909, 1918 and 1933. The club was at its most successful in the 1930s, when key recruits from both Victoria and interstate led to a string of appearances in the finals, including four successive grand final appearances from 1933 to 1936, albeit with only one premiership in 1933. On Grand Final eve, 1935, as the Swans prepared to take on Collingwood, star full-forward Bob Pratt was clipped by a truck moments after stepping off a tram and subsequently missed the match for South. Ironically, the truck driver was a South Melbourne supporter.  , It was during this period that the team became known as the Swans, the nickname having been given courtesy of the number of West Australians in the team (Swans being the state emblem of Western Australia). The name stuck, partially due to the association with nearby Albert Park and Lake , also known for its white swans (although there are no longer any non-native white swans and only black, indigenous swans in the lake). , After several years with only limited success, South Melbourne next reached the grand final in 1945. The match, played against Carlton, was to become known as "the Bloodbath", courtesy of the brawl that overshadowed the match, with a total of 9 players being reported by the umpires. Carlton won the match by 28 points, and from then on, South Melbourne struggled. , In the following years, South Melbourne consistently struggled, as their traditional inner-city recruiting district largely emptied as a result of demographic shifts. The club missed the finals in 1946 and continued to fall such that by 1950 they were second-last on the ladder. They nearly made the finals in 1952, but in the following seventeen years South Melbourne did not finish above eighth position. By the 1960s it was clear that South Melbourne's financial resources would not be capable of allowing them to compete in the growing market for country and interstate players, and their own local zone was never strong enough to compensate for this. The introduction of country zoning failed to help, as the Riverina Football League proved to be one of the least profitable zones. , Between 1945 and 1981, South Melbourne played finals only twice: under legendary coach Norm Smith , South Melbourne finished fourth in 1970, but lost the first semi-final; and, in 1977, the club finished fifth under coach Ian Stewart, but lost the elimination final – but there were three wooden spoons in the intervening period, and between Round 7, 1972 and Round 13, 1973, the team lost 29 consecutive games. By the end of the 1970s South Melbourne had massive debts after struggling for such a long period of time. , In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the VFL was strategically interested in seeing a club based in Sydney, as part of a long-term plan to broaden the appeal of the game in Queensland and New South Wales . The league had started moving a few premiership matches to the Sydney Cricket Ground annually since 1979, and in 1981 was preparing to establish an entirely new, 13th VFL club in Sydney; but these plans halted when the South Melbourne board, recognising the difficulties it faced with viability and financial stability in Melbourne, made the decision to play all 1982 home games in Sydney. On 29 July 1981, the VFL formally accepted the proposal, and paved the way for the Swans to shift to Sydney in 1982. , The move caused great internal difficulties, as a group of supporters known as Keep South At South campaigned throughout the rest of 1981 to stop the move; and, at an extraordinary general meeting on 22 September, the group democratically took control of the club's board. However, the new board did not have the power to unilaterally stop the move to Sydney: under the VFL constitution, to rescind the decision that had been made on 29 July required a three-quarters majority in a vote of all twelve clubs, and at a meeting on 14 October it failed to obtain this majority.  The new board also lacked the support of the players, the vast majority of whom were in favour of a long-term move to Sydney; in early November, after the board promised that it would try to bring the club back to Melbourne in 1983, the players went on strike, seeking to force the new board commit to Sydney in the long term, as well as seeking payments that the cash-strapped club owed them from the previous season.  The board ended up undermining its own position when it accepted a $400,000 loan from the VFL in late November to stay solvent, under the condition that it commit to Sydney for two years. Finally, in early December, the Keep South At South board resigned, and a board in favour of the move to Sydney was installed.  , Upon moving, the club played at the Sydney Cricket Ground. In 1982, the club was technically a Melbourne-based club which played all of its home games in Sydney; it dropped the name 'South Melbourne' in June 1982, becoming known as simply 'the Swans' for the rest of that season.  It was not until 1983 that the club formally moved its operations to Sydney and became the Sydney Swans.  Its physical 'home club' was the 'Southern Cross Social Club' at 120a Clovelly Road, Randwick, New South Wales which became bankrupt in 1987; new Sydney Swans Offices were then set up in the Sydney Football Stadium. , On 31 July 1985, for what was thought to be $6.3 million, Geoffrey Edelsten "bought" the Swans; in reality it was $2.9 million in cash with funding and other payments spread over five years. Edelsten resigned as chairman in less than twelve months, but had already made his mark. He immediately recruited former Geelong coach Tom Hafey . Hafey, in turn, used his knowledge of Geelong’s contracts to recruit David Bolton , Bernard Toohey and Greg Williams , who would all form a key part of the Sydney side, at a league-determined total fee of $240,000 (less than the $500,000 Geelong demanded and even the $300,000 Sydney offered).  The likes of Gerard Healy , Merv Neagle and Paul Morwood were also poached from other clubs, and failed approaches were made to Simon Madden , Terry Daniher , Andrew Bews and Maurice Rioli .  , During the Edelsten years, the Swans were seen by the Sydney public as a flamboyant club, typified by the style of its spearhead, Warwick Capper , his long bright blond mullet and bright pink boots made him unmissable on the field and his pink Lamborghini, penchant for fashion models and eccentricity made him notorious off the field – all somewhat fashionable in the 1980s . During Capper's peak years, the Swans had made successive finals appearances for the first time since relocating. His consistently spectacular aerial exploits earned him consecutive Mark of the Year awards while his goalkicking efforts (amassing 103 goals in 1987) made him runner up in the Coleman Medal two years running. The Swans' successive finals appearances saw crowds during this time peak at an average of around 25,000 per game. Edelsten also introduced the "Swanettes", becoming the sole such cheerleading group among VFL teams following the disbandment of Carlton's Blue Birds in 1986. The Swanettes did not get much performance time, owing to the short intervals between quarters of play in the AFL and the lack of space in which they might perform while other activities take place on the field. The Swanettes were soon discontinued and no AFL club has had cheerleaders since then. , In 1987, the Swans scored 201 points against the West Coast Eagles and the following week scored 236 points against the Essendon Football Club . Both games were at the SCG. The Swans are one of the few teams to have scored two scores above 200 points in a row, the feat also being achieved by Geelong in 1992.  , The club's form was to slump in the following year. , Losses were in the millions. A group of financial backers including Mike Willessee , Basil Sellers, Peter Weinert and Craig Kimberley purchased the licence and bankrolled the club until 1993, when the AFL stepped in. , Morale at the side plummeted as players were asked to take pay cuts.  Legendary coach Tom Hafey was sacked by the club in 1988 after a player-led rebellion at his tough training methods (unusual in the semi-professional days of that era). , Capper was sold to the Brisbane Bears for $400,000 in a desperate attempt to improve the club’s finances. Instead, it only led to disastrous on-field performances. Instead of a 100-goal-a-season forward, Sydney’s goalkicking was led by defender Bernard Toohey with 29 in 1989, then Jim West with 34 in 1990. Players left the club in droves, including Brownlow Medalist Greg Williams , Bernard Toohey and Barry Mitchell . The careers of stars such as Dennis Carroll , David Bolton , Ian Roberts , Tony Morwood and David Murphy came to an end,  while promising young players like Jamie Lawson , Robert Teal and Paul Bryce had their careers cut short by injury. , Attendances consistently dropped below 10,000 when the team performed poorly between 1990 and 1994, with the side winning the wooden spoon in 1992, 1993 and 1994. , The AFL stepped in to save the Swans, offering substantial monetary and management support. The club survived, despite strong rumours in 1992 that it would merge with the Brisbane Bears to form a combined New South Wales/Queensland team, fold altogether, or even move back to South Melbourne. With draft and salary cap concessions in the early 1990s and a series of notable recruits, the team were competitive after the early part of the decade. , During this time, the side was largely held together by two inspirational skippers, both from the Wagga Wagga region of country New South Wales, Dennis Carroll and later the courageous captain Paul Kelly . , Desperate to hang on, the club was keen to enlist the biggest names and identities in the AFL, and recruited legendary coach Ron Barassi who helped save the club from extinction while serving them as coach from Round 7, 1993 to 1995. At roughly the same time, Hawthorn legend Dermott Brereton was also recruited, albeit with little on-field impact. On a much brighter side for the Swans, their captain Paul Kelly won the League's highest individual honour, the Brownlow Medal , in 1995. , A big coup for the club was recruitment of St Kilda Football Club champion Tony "Plugger" Lockett in 1995. Lockett became a cult figure in Sydney, with an instant impact and along with the Super League war in the struggling rival rugby league football code in Australia, helped the Swans to become a powerhouse Sydney icon. , 1995 would be Barassi's last year in charge. The Swans won 8 games- as much as they did in the previous three years combined- and finished with a percentage of over 100 (in fact, they have managed such consistently ever since). They were also one of only two teams to defeat the all-conquering Carlton side of that year. Swans great Paul Kelly also won the Brownlow Medal that year. Barassi left an improving team, a club in a much better state than he found them. , Former Hawthorn player Rodney Eade took over the reins in 1996 and after a slow start (they lost their first two games of the season), turned the club around into a competitive force. The Swans ended the minor round on top of the premiership table with 16 wins, 5 losses, and 1 draw. In the finals, the Swans won one of the most thrilling AFL preliminary finals in history after Plugger Lockett kicked a behind after the siren to win the game. The Swans lost the grand final to North Melbourne , which had been their first appearance in a grand final since 1945. The game was played in front of 93,102 at the MCG . , The Swans then made the finals for four of the next five full years that Rodney Eade was in charge of. In 1998 they finished 3rd on the AFL ladder; despite beating St Kilda in their first final the Swans were then beaten by eventual premiers Adelaide in the semi-final at the SCG . , The 1999 season was a largely uneventful year for the club, the only real highlight being Tony Lockett kicking his record-breaking 1300th goal against Collingwood in Round 10. The 1999 season ended with a 69-point mauling at the hands of minor premiers Essendon . , After missing the finals in 2000 , the Swans rebounded to finish 7th in 2001 , but were beaten by Hawthorn by 55 points in their elimination final at Colonial Stadium . , Former Swans favourite son Paul Roos was appointed coach midway through the 2002 season, replacing Rodney Eade. Eade was removed after Round 12, when Roos took over. He had an immediate impact, winning six of the remaining 10 games that year (including the last four of the season), and continuing a record as a successful coach with the Swans for the eight full seasons that would follow. , A new home ground in ANZ Stadium (then known as Telstra Stadium) provided increased capacity over the SCG. The Swans' first game played at the Stadium in Round 9, 2002 against Essendon attracted 54,169 spectators. The Sydney Swans v Collingwood match on 23 August 2003 set an attendance record for the largest crowd to watch an AFL game outside of Victoria with an official attendance of 72,393 and was the largest home and away AFL crowd at any stadium for 2003. A preliminary final against the Brisbane Lions in 2003 attracted 71,019 people. The Swans lost all three of those significant matches. , 2004 saw an average year for Sydney, however one highlight was when they ended St Kilda 's undefeated start to the season in Round 11. The match was notable for Leo Barry 's effort in nullifying the impact of St Kilda's monstrous full-forward and eventual Coleman Medallist Fraser Gehrig , whom Barry restricted to only two possessions for the entire match. , Sydney was able to recruit another St Kilda export in the Lockett mould, Barry Hall . There were obvious parallels to the signing of Lockett (a powerful, tough forward from St Kilda with questions over his discipline and attitude), which left Hall with much to live up to. He flourished in his new surroundings and eventually became a cult figure and club leader in his own right. , As the new century dawned, Sydney implemented a policy of giving up high order draft picks in exchange for players who struggled at other clubs. It was during this era that the Swans picked up the likes of Paul Williams , Barry Hall , Craig Bolton , Darren Jolly , Ted Richards , Peter Everitt , Martin Mattner , Rhyce Shaw , Shane Mumford , Ben McGlynn and Mitch Morton , amongst others, and giving up higher order draft picks meant the Swans missed out on the likes of Daniel Motlop , Nick Dal Santo , James Kelly , Courtenay Dempsey and Sam Lonergan who went to Port Adelaide , St Kilda , Geelong and the latter two to Essendon respectively. This policy is said to have paid off in the Roos era, as they implemented a strict culture of discipline at the club. , Sydney played the AFL Grand Final on 24 September 2005 against the West Coast Eagles , defeating them by four points, final score 8.10 (58) to West Coast's 7.12 (54). In the last few minutes, the Sydney defence held strong, with Leo Barry marking the ball just before the siren to stop the Eagles' final desperate shot at goal. The premiership was the Swans' first in 72 years and their first since being based in Sydney. It was also the fifth premiership in succession to be won by a team from outside Victoria . , In 2005, the Swans came under enormous public scrutiny, even from AFL CEO Andrew Demetriou for their unorthodox, "boring" defense-oriented tactics that included tightly controlling the tempo of the game and starving the opposition of possession (in fact, seven teams that season had their lowest possession total whilst playing against the Swans). The coach Paul Roos maintained that playing contested football was the style used by all recent premiership winning teams, and felt that it was ironic that the much criticised strategy proved ultimately successful. , On Friday, 30 September 2005 a ticker tape parade down Sydney's George Street was held in honour of the Swans' achievements, which ended with a rally at Town Hall , where Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore presented the team with the key to the city. The flag of the Swans also flew on top of the Sydney Harbour Bridge during the week; the same flag was later given to WA premier Geoff Gallop to fly on top of the state legislature in Perth as part of the friendly wager between Gallop and NSW premier Morris Iemma . , The 2006 AFL Grand Final was contested between the Sydney Swans and West Coast Eagles at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 30 September 2006. The West Coast Eagles avenged their 2005 Grand Final defeat by beating the Sydney Swans by one point, only the fourth one-point Grand Final margin in the competition's history. , The rivalry between the Sydney Swans and West Coast Eagles has become one of the great modern rivalries.  The six games between the two sides (from the start of the 2005 finals to the first round of 2007 inclusive) were decided by a combined margin of 13 points. Four of those six games were finals, and 2 Grand Finals. , Sydney finished the 2007 home and away season in 7th place, and advanced to the finals, where they faced and were defeated by Collingwood by 38 points in the elimination final. It was their earliest exit from the finals since 2001 and was a culmination of a mostly disappointing season, as only victories against lesser teams saw them through to a fifth consecutive finals campaign. , The conclusion of the 2007 trade saw the loss of Adam Schneider and Sean Dempster to St Kilda , the delisting of Simon Phillips , Jonathan Simpkin and Luke Vogels , and the gain of Henry Playfair from Geelong and Martin Mattner from Adelaide . , The Swans spent the middle part of the 2008 season inside the top four, however a late form slump which yielded only three wins in the last nine rounds saw the Swans drop to sixth at the conclusion of the 2008 regular season. Having qualified for the finals for a sixth consecutive season, the Swans defeated North Melbourne in the elimination final before losing to the Western Bulldogs the following week. , 2009 saw the club register only eight victories as they failed to reach the finals for the first time since 2002, finishing 12th with a percentage of below 100% for the first time since 1994. Barry Hall , Leo Barry , Jared Crouch , Michael O'Loughlin , Amon Buchanan and Darren Jolly all departed at the conclusion of the season, with Mark Seaby , Daniel Bradshaw and Shane Mumford , among others, joining the club during the trade period. , The 2010 season saw Sydney return to the finals by virtue of a fifth-place finish at the end of the regular season. The club defeated Carlton by five points in the elimination final before losing to the Western Bulldogs in the semi-finals for the second time in three seasons. The loss signalled the end of the Swans coaching career of Paul Roos as well as that of the playing career of Brett Kirk . , Former North Melbourne premiership-winning forward John Longmire took over as coach of the Swans as part of a succession plan initiated by Paul Roos in 2009 prior to the beginning of the 2011 season. He led the club to a seventh-place finish at the end of the regular season, therefore qualifying for the finals for the 13th time in the past 16 seasons. The Swans defeated St Kilda in an elimination final at Docklands Stadium before losing to Hawthorn in the semi-finals the following week. , It was during the regular season that the Swans caused the upset of the season, defeating the star-studded Geelong Cats on its home ground, Skilled Stadium , where the home tenant had won its past 29 games in succession, and its past two matches at the ground by a combined margin of 336 points, in Round 23.

After an even and physical first half, Sydney went on to win by 63 points.

This was the first time in a finals series that former Hawk player Lance Franklin would play against his former team, one of very few players to have played back to back grand finals for two different teams. The Hawks dominated the game quite early and eventually defeated the Swans 11.8.(74)to 21.11.(137). The 63 point loss was Sydney's biggest ever loss in a grand final and their biggest defeat all season meaning Hawthorn would become back to back premiers for the second time in their history. , The Swans' continued period of success, in which it has missed the finals only three times since 1995, has led to some criticism about a salary cap concession which the club receives; the concession is in the form of an additional Cost of Living Allowance (COLA), due to the higher cost of living in Sydney compared with any other Australian city.   It was, however, announced in March 2014 that this allowance would be scrapped.  , The jumper is white with a red back and a red yoke with a silhouette of the Sydney Opera House at the point of the yoke.

Little success resulted and the Swans entered a stand-alone reserves team in the AFL Canberra competition in 2003 which resulted in four consecutive premierships between 2005-2008.

The Whitten Oval underwent a A$ 20 million redevelopment  starting in 2005 to improve the club's headquarters and training facilities. , , , Footscray, also known as the Prince Imperials from 1880–1882, played in the junior division of the VFA before joining the senior division of the VFA in 1886. Following the famed breakaway of 1896 , during which the stronger VFA clubs formed the VFL, the tricolours (as they were known during this period) became a force in the VFA. The club went on to win nine premierships between 1898 and 1924, including a hat-trick from 1898 to 1900 and four premierships between 1919 and 1924. The 1924 premiership would be Footscray's last in the VFA. After the 1924 season, the club challenged the premiers of the VFL, Essendon , to a charity game for the benefit of Dame Nellie Melba's Limbless Soldiers' Appeal.  , Starting in 1919, the VFL had nine clubs, which caused one team to be idle every Saturday; the VFL was keen to do away with this bye each week. On the night of 9 January 1925, a committee meeting of the VFL, chaired by Reg Hunt of Carlton , decided to expand the league from nine clubs to twelve. It was decided in the meeting to admit the Footscray Football Club, along with Hawthorn and North Melbourne; all three teams were from the VFA. Hunt originally recommended Hawthorn, Footscray and Prahran, but eventually North Melbourne was substituted for Prahran because of ground control matters. , Footscray adapted relatively quickly to the standard of VFL football despite losing some of their VFA stars, and by 1928 were already a contender for the finals, missing only on percentage in 1931. Though they slipped to eleventh place in 1930, 1935 and 1937, in 1938 they became the first of the new clubs to reach the finals. They fell back drastically in 1939, but played better during the war-torn 1940s, winning their first nine games in 1946. , In this period, Footscray failed to win in finals, losing six first semis between 1938 and 1951. In 1953, however, they set a record of conceding only 959 points in the home-and-away games due to a powerful defence featuring Wally Donald , Herb Henderson and Jim Gallagher . They finally won their first semifinal against Essendon, and the following year took out their first VFL premiership, beating Geelong and then Melbourne in the 1954 VFL Grand Final . , This success was in no small part due to two champions of the club – Charlie Sutton the wily and tough captain-coach at the time, and Ted Whitten snr., otherwise known as "E.J." or "Mr Football", one of Australian rules football's best ever players. Sutton claims to have invented the modern play-on style of football – run, handball, run, kick. Whitten was famous for his inventive and lightning-fast flick pass , which was banned due to the umpire's difficulty in distinguishing whether the ball was thrown, or hit with the open hand. , Footscray failed to capitalise on their premiership success, falling off in the latter part of the decade and finishing with their first wooden spoon in 1959. , The decade started promisingly, with the club bouncing back to reach the 1961 Grand Final , when they were beaten by Hawthorn. This was followed by winning the 1963 and 1964 night premierships, although this success was not transferred into the season proper. The rest of the decade was a bleak era for the club, particularly between 1965 and 1969, when they finished in the bottom three every year. , Ted Whitten Snr. retired as a player in 1970 and held the record for the most VFL games played at the time (321 games); he would continue in a coaching capacity until the end of 1971. The club was relatively strong in the 1970s, but did not win a final; by decade's end they were back near the bottom. , The main stars of the decade included Gary Dempsey , the heroic ruckman who was badly burnt in Lara bushfire of January 1969 but managed to take out the game's top individual award, the Brownlow Medal , in 1975. Promising South Australian import Neil Sachse had his neck broken in a freak accident while playing against Fitzroy at the Western Oval. He was left quadriplegic . In 1978, Kelvin Templeton became the first Bulldogs player to kick 100 goals in a season, including a club record of 15.9 in Round 13 against St Kilda. , With the disappointing 1970s behind it, the club introduced an array of stars during this decade. Simon Beasley became a household name after being recruited from Swan Districts in Western Australia to provide the Bulldogs with a genuine replacement for champion Kelvin Templeton. Beasley was to go on to become the Bulldogs' record goal kicker and face of the club during the mid-1980s. , Mick Malthouse was appointed senior coach in 1984, and a dramatic improvement saw them rise to second position in 1985 before a ten-point loss in the preliminary finals against Hawthorn. The club boasted a list of top players at this time, with Beasley, Doug Hawkins , Brian Royal , Rick Kennedy , Steve Wallis , Peter Foster , Michael McLean , Jim Edmond , Andrew Purser , Stephen MacPherson and Brad Hardie . The Bulldogs narrowly missed the finals in 1987 when they were beaten by Melbourne in the last round in front of a record crowd at their home ground. , Discontent between players, officials and fans reached an all-time low during the 1989 season. Bulldogs president Barrie Beattie was replaced by businessman and prominent racing personality Nick Columb in March. Faced with the prospect of running a club with declining membership and sponsorship, Columb also learned that the team's debt situation was poor, and it reached the point when the VFL looked likely to appoint an administrator to wind up the club's affairs at the end of the year.  , Columb decided the best way forward was a merger with the Fitzroy Lions , which was also in a weak financial position, although was not facing immediate bankruptcy. The two clubs announced a merger to form the Fitzroy Bulldogs , but the merger was derailed when the people of Footscray, led by businessman Peter Gordon and a host of others, rallied to raise funds to pay off the club's debts. In further developments, former club player Terry Wheeler was named as Malthouse's replacement as senior coach, while champion veteran wingman Doug Hawkins was appointed captain. While Columb was branded by some as the villain of the story, the wisdom of hindsight shows that had he not instigated the merger, the Western Bulldogs would not exist as it does today.   , The Bulldogs began the new decade in promising fashion, finishing in seventh place with twelve wins in 1990, including one against eventual premiers Collingwood, when rover Steven Kolyniuk ran around the man on the mark and kicked a goal to put his team in front. Although they just missed out on the finals, there was much to look forward to, and the year was capped off with diminutive rover Tony Liberatore winning the Brownlow Medal. , After a disappointing 1991, the Bulldogs bounced back in 1992, finishing second on the ladder and making their first finals appearance since 1985. Danny Del-Re was an excellent full forward, while champion veterans Hawkins, Royal, Wallis, Foster and MacPherson helped ensure the club played its best football in many years. Scott Wynd capped a magnificent year with the Brownlow Medal, while Chris Grant and Simon Atkins also had outstanding seasons. , In 1994 and 1995, the Bulldogs again made the finals, only to be eliminated by Melbourne and Geelong, respectively. Leon Cameron and Daniel Southern were stars. In August, Ted Whitten snr. died from prostate cancer; such was his status in the game that he was given a state funeral . In his honour, the club renamed the Western Oval the Whitten Oval, and a memorial statue of Whitten was erected outside the stadium. , Under the tightly focused management of club president David Smorgon , driven coaching by Terry Wallace , and the on-field leadership of Chris Grant (who narrowly missed a Brownlow Medal in 1996 and 1997) and Tony Liberatore , the club had a successful period through the mid- to late 1990s, making the finals from 1997 to 2000. The 1997 season is remembered for the club's cruellest loss, to eventual premiers Adelaide in the preliminary final by two points after leading for much of the game and appearing to be headed for their first grand final since 1961. Rohan Smith , Brad Johnson , Chris Grant, Jose Romero , Paul Hudson and company were catalysts in a fine season. , During Smorgon's term, the Club was renamed from Footscray to Western Bulldogs and moved their home games from the Whitten Oval, first to Optus Oval from 1997 to 1999, and then to the newly built Docklands Stadium for the 2000 season. , After Terry Wallace's departure at the end of 2002, assistant coach Peter Rohde took charge, but after two miserable seasons, the Bulldogs appointed Rodney Eade as coach in 2005. Improvement was immediate, with the Bulldogs winning 11 games and finishing ninth on the ladder in 2005, missing out on the finals by just half a game. Missing the finals dealt a blow to both players and supporters of the team, as late season success led to the team being considered real premiership contenders. , In 2006, the Bulldogs continued to play well despite a disastrous run of injuries throughout the year; with five players having to have knee reconstructions, including captain Luke Darcy . Despite this setback, the Bulldogs finished the home-and-away season with 13 wins (see 2006 AFL season ), making it to the finals for the first time since 2000, with Scott West and Brad Johnson continuing their excellent play. They won the Elimination Final against Collingwood in front of 84,000 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) and reached the semi-finals before being defeated by eventual Premiers the West Coast Eagles at Subiaco Oval . , On 5 August 2006, Chris Grant broke the Western Bulldogs record for the most senior AFL/VFL games at the club. On this day he played his 330th game, breaking Doug Hawkins' previous record of 329 games. , Looking for new markets, the club had played one game every year at the Sydney Cricket Ground and one "home" game each year at Marrara Oval in Darwin . On 16 August 2006, the league announced that the Bulldogs' Sydney "home" game would be played at Manuka Oval , Canberra in 2007, 2008 and 2009. , Prior to the 2007 season, the Bulldogs made a splash by trading for Brisbane midfielder Jason Akermanis . They were premiership favourites early on in 2007, but yet again injuries took their toll, and they faltered in the last seven rounds, losing six games and drawing one, to finish 13th. , In the 2008 pre-season they traded away Jordan McMahon to Richmond and Sam Power to North Melbourne. They also recruited ruckman Ben Hudson and forward Scott Welsh from Adelaide and back Tim Callan from Geelong in what was a very successful trade week. In 2008 , the Bulldogs were widely predicted for the bottom four after the pre-season , but had a successful home-and-away season, finishing in third place with fifteen wins, one draw and six losses (five of which occurred in the season's last seven games). The team's finals campaign began with a loss to Hawthorn by 51 points at the MCG in the first qualifying final, but won the subsequent semi-final against Sydney by 37 points. The Bulldogs lost their preliminary final match against reigning premiers Geelong. , Much was expected of the Bulldogs following their 3rd-place finish in 2008. They began the 2009 season with a 63-point thrashing of Fremantle in Perth, and then recorded solid wins over North Melbourne and Richmond before losing their next three games to West Coast (in Perth), Carlton and St Kilda. The Bulldogs then notched up their first away win against Adelaide since 2001, kicking eight goals to one in the third quarter to win by 32 points. The following week, they survived a determined effort from Melbourne, winning by 14 points, before succumbing to Geelong in one of the best and closest games of the season. They proceeded to win their next five games, including a 93-point drubbing of Port Adelaide in Darwin and an 88-point win over the reigning premiers Hawthorn. After a bit of a dip in form including losses to Collingwood, St Kilda and West Coast, the Bulldogs rebounded with an 18-point win against Brisbane at The Gabba . That was followed up by a 14-point win over Geelong. In the final round of the home-and-away season, the Bulldogs needed to defeat Collingwood by more than 22 points in order to reclaim third place on the ladder. The Bulldogs managed win by 24 points, earning the right to play Geelong in the first week of the finals.  , There was media expectation that the Western Bulldogs would feature in the top four in 2010 after doing so in 2008 and 2009. The pre-season delivered the Western Bulldogs their first competition victory since 1970. The Bulldogs defeated St Kilda by 40 points in the NAB Cup Grand Final, with new recruit Barry Hall starring with seven goals and winning the Michael Tuck Medal for being the best player. However, after a promising pre-season, the Bulldogs failed to make their first grand final in 49 years after being demolished by Collingwood in the first round of the finals, coming back against the Sydney Swans and losing to St Kilda in a preliminary final, captain Brad Johnson's last game.  , 2011 was a disappointing year for the Bulldogs. After a Round 1 thrashing at the hands of Essendon by 55 points, the season never looked on track. After Round 21, which was a 49-point loss to Essendon, coach Rodney Eade was sacked by the Western Bulldogs after seven years at the helm. The club finished the year with wins against Port Adelaide and Fremantle and a loss against Hawthorn. The Bulldogs finished 2011 with a 9-win, 13-loss record for the season. Shortly after the 2011 season was completed, long-time Geelong and Essendon assistant Brendan McCartney was appointed as the senior coach on a three-year contract. During the following months, the Bulldogs assembled a coaching panel consisting of senior coach McCartney, former Geelong and St Kilda ruckman Steven King , former Sydney Swans and North Melbourne midfielder Shannon Grant , former Bulldogs champion and 300 game player Rohan Smith, and former Bulldogs and Port Adelaide player Brett Montgomery . , In October 2012, long-time President David Smorgon stepped down from the role to be replaced by former President Peter Gordon. Smorgon served as President from 1996 to 2012, overseeing two rebuilding phases, the erasure of much debt, and a period of stability after decades of uncertainty surrounding the club's future. In 2014, the Bulldogs returned to state league football when they fielded their reserves team in the Victorian Football League under the name of Footscray, ending their alignment with the Williamstown Football Club. The decision proved an instant hit on and off the field, with supporters of the AFL club taking a strong liking to the newly established VFL team. The success however flowed onto the field as well, with the club securing the VFL Premiership in its first season in the competition, defeating the Box Hill Hawks by 22 points in the VFL Grand Final. , The club's home ground since foundation has been Whitten Oval located in the suburb of Footscray, west of the Melbourne CBD. , The E.J. Whitten Stand , EJ Whitten statue , Whitten Oval is the Western Bulldogs' administrative and training headquarters , Western Bulldogs' club song is sung to " Sons of the Sea ". , Before the club changed its name from Footscray to Western Bulldogs, the club song was called "Sons of the 'Scray", sung to the same tune but with different lyrics. , The real life mascot for the Western Bulldogs is a pedigree six-year-old pure white British Bulldog named ' Sid' ( pedigree name Murlane Bigshot ). Sid appears at all of the Western Bulldogs home games at the Docklands Stadium wearing the club colours. He can be found walking around the perimeter of the ground prior to the game. He then waits for the players to come out on the ground; they give him a pat as they run past to the banner. During the game, Sid has a reserved area at the Footscray End (Gate 7), where fans can come and give him a pat and have their photo taken. , Since the 1990s the Western Bulldogs have struggled for membership and financial backing, avoiding folding or merging with another club through heavy subsidisation from the AFL as part of a competitive balance fund. However, in 2006 the Bulldogs broke their membership record and continued to sustain these membership figures before another breakthrough Club membership record in 2010. , Former Prime Minister Julia Gillard and actor Chris Hemsworth are supporters of the club.   , Total senior premierships: 10 Senior premierships won by senior team (9) , Senior premierships won by reserves team (1) , Premierships (1) , Runners-up (1) , Premierships (5) , In May 2002, the club announced a team of the greatest players from the last century. , , Head coach , Assistant coaches , , , The Charles Sutton Medal is awarded to the player adjudged Best and Fairest for the Western Bulldogs. , This is awarded to the player judged to be the most courageous for the season. , The Footscray reserves team began competing in the VFL/AFL Reserves competition with the league's other reserves teams from when Footscray was first admitted to the VFL in 1925. The team won six premierships between 1925 and 1999. Following the demise of AFL reserves competition in 2000, the reserves team was dissolved and a reserves affiliation was established with the new Victorian Football League 's two western clubs: Werribee and Williamstown . From 2001 until 2007, the club was aligned solely with Werribee; and then from 2008 until 2013, the club was aligned solely with Williamstown. , After a fifteen year recess, the club re-established a stand-alone reserves team to compete in the Victorian Football League from 2014 onward.  The reserves team took on the club's traditional name Footscray Bulldogs , even though the senior team continued to operate as the Western Bulldogs,  and it played its home games at Whitten Oval .  The club won the VFL premiership in its first season, barring their history prior to 1925.   The Hawthorn Football Club , nicknamed The Hawks , is a professional Australian rules football club in the Australian Football League (AFL). The club, founded in 1902, is the youngest of the Victorian -based teams in the AFL and has won twelve VFL/AFL premierships; renowned as the only club having won premierships in each decade of the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and 2010s. The team play in brown and gold vertically striped guernseys . The club's Latin motto is spectemur agendo , the English translation being "By our deeds we shall be known". , The Hawks' origins are in the inner-eastern Melbourne suburb of Hawthorn and also at Glenferrie Oval , the club's former administrative and training base and social club. Matches, however, have not been played there since 1973. In 2006, Hawthorn's training and administration facilities were relocated to Waverley Park in the middle of the club's major supporter base in Melbourne's outer-eastern region. Since 2007 Hawthorn have played four games a year at their second ground of York Park in Launceston , Tasmania, with the remaining games played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground , the club's current playing home ground . Hawthorn's current Victorian Football League (VFL) affiliate team is the Box Hill Hawks Football Club . , . , The official club history books and many supporters strongly believe that the club's origins date back to its founding in 1873 at a meeting at the Hawthorne Hotel.  , Although a Hawthorn Football Club did indeed form at this time – and the region has since continuously been represented by a football team – it was not the Hawthorn which competes at AFL level today. It is likely that today’s club is actually the third club to carry the name ‘Hawthorn Football Club’. In The Daily Telegraph of 12 May 1883 it is stated that “The Hawthorn Club having disbanded, all engagements for the ensuing season have been cancelled.” In 1889 the Riversdale Football Club (formed in 1880) is reported to have changed its name to the Hawthorn Football Club. This club also ceased in 1890. No Hawthorn club existed from 1890 to 1892. , A new representative club, called the ‘Hawthorn Football Club’, was formed in 1893. It competed in the Victorian Junior Football Association until 1898. Without a ground to play on, however, the club was disbanded in 1899. , In March 1902, Alf Kosky formed a club from the various district clubs under the banner of Hawthorn Football Club to compete in the Metropolitan Junior Football Association.  The club merged with Boroondara (late Waterloo) in 1905 and adopted Boroondara's colours of a black guernsey with red sash but retained the name of Hawthorn. In 1906 Hawthorn merged with successful junior club the Hawthorn Rovers to form the Hawthorn City Football Club as a result of Glenferrie Oval opening. The club was reformed in 1912, changing to a gold guernsey with a blue V. The council then applied to the Victorian Football Association (VFA) for inclusion which was granted in 1914 when Hawthorn replaced the disbanded Melbourne City club. , The first task for the club was to decide on club colours, their jumper of blue and gold was already taken by Williamstown so a change was required. At a Special General Meeting held on 17 February 1914, a Mr J. Brain proposed brown and gold as the new colours and the motion was carried. , The Mayblooms won three games and a draw in their first season in the VFA. The effect of World War I with players enlisting caused the club to finish last in 1915. The VFA then went into recess in 1916 and 1917, and Hawthorn did not compete when resumption occurred in 1918. Upon Hawthorn’s resumption in 1919 it was more competitive winning eight games and finishing sixth out of ten teams. Hawthorn dropped to eighth in 1920 but in 1921 they won seven games and finished sixth. , Bill Walton was appointed captain-coach of Hawthorn in 1922. He was however refused a clearance by Port Melbourne and as a result spent the season playing for them, while coaching Hawthorn during the week. Twice that season, he had the unusual situation of playing a VFA game against the club that he coached. In one of those matches a Port Melbourne teammate had to be restrained from striking Walton over Walton's vocal support for the player's opponent. In 1922 the club missed the finals by percentage and Hawthorn set a new record score in the VFA scoring 30.31.211 to Prahran 6.9.45. In 1923 he was granted his clearance and the club made the finals finishing in fourth place and then losing to Port Melbourne in the first semi-final. 1924 the club finished fifth, missing the finals by four points. , Since 1919 the VFL had nine clubs which caused one team to be idle every Saturday. The VFL was keen to do away with this bye via the admission of a tenth club. In 1924 a group calling itself the Hawthorn Citizens’ League Campaign Committee began gathering support for the football club admittance to the VFL. Other representations came from Brighton, Brunswick, Footscray, North Melbourne, Prahran, Camberwell and Caulfield. , On the night of 9 January 1925 a committee meeting of the VFL, chaired by Reg Hunt of Carlton , decided to expand the competition from nine clubs to twelve. It was decided in the meeting to admit the "Hawthorn Football Club", along with Footscray and North Melbourne , all three coming from the Victorian Football Association (VFA). Hunt originally recommended Hawthorn, Footscray and Prahran but eventually North Melbourne was substituted for Prahran because of ground control matters. , The Mayblooms , as they were then known became the perennial whipping boys of the competition. Hawthorn had an almost casual attitude towards playing football and, lying remote from major industrial areas and consequently devoid of the business or political patrons available to Carlton , Richmond and Collingwood ,  were not able to even pay their players the match payment then allowed by the Coulter Law. Despite the presence of a number players of true class such as Bert Hyde , Bert Mills , Stan Spinks , Alec Albiston and Col Austen , Hawthorn never won more than seven games in a season in its first seventeen years in the League. , Roy Cazaly was the non-playing coach of Hawthorn in 1942, he was reported to have given the club its nickname the “Hawks” on the suggestion of one of his daughters. Cazaly thought that it was tougher than their original nickname the “Mayblooms” and 1943 turned out to be the club's best season since joining the VFL in which the club missed the finals only by percentage. However, Hawthorn immediately returned to the bottom of the ladder, consistently competing with St Kilda for the wooden spoon. Between 1944 and 1953 the club finished last or second last in every year but one. , Half back flanker Col Austen tied with South Melbourne ’s Ron Clegg for the 1949 Brownlow Medal but was not awarded it based on the “countback” system in place at that time. The League later changed the system for tied results and, in 1989, he was awarded the medal retrospectively. , 1950 started with the club in turmoil, The club appointed Bob McCaskill as coach and he wanted Kevin Curran to be captain. Outgoing captain-coach Alec Albiston was angry as he was told by a member of the board that he would remain as captain. Brownlow Medallist Col Austen sided with Albiston and a split occurred. The board sided with the new coach and gave Albiston and Austen open clearances. Without the club’s best two players, the team did not win a match in 1950 . New captain Kevin Curran was suspended for striking Austen on the first occasion Hawthorn and Austen’s new club Richmond played. , The club decided to changed its playing jumper to the brown and gold vertical stripes. , Two positives were the arrival of John Kennedy and Roy Simmonds . Over the next ten years, Kennedy would play 169 games for Hawthorn, serving as Captain from 1955 until his retirement in 1959, and winning the club’s Best and Fairest award four times (in 1950, 51, 52 and 54). Simmonds would play 192 games and win the club's Best and Fairest award in 1955. , In 1952 Jack Hale took over as coach, Hale had been Bob McCaskill ’s assistant, but McCaskill’s health was failing and he died in June 1952. Aided by dividends from the VFL’s finals revenue making the club more competitive financially  – despite no Hawthorn team in any grade playing VFL finals to that point  – this proved the decisive step in the movement of Hawthorn away from the bottom of the ladder. He eliminated the casual attitude that prevailed at the club during its first thirty years in the VFL and made the club less accepting of defeat than before. Although Hawthorn finished last in 1953, from the following year improvement was steady. , Hawthorn had their first recruitment coup in 1954 by signing Clayton “Candles” Thompson from South Australia. Thompson was the glamour player from the 1953 National Football Championships, kicking ten goals against Western Australia. Fresh from school, teenagers John Peck , Allan Woodley , Noel Voigt and Brian Kann started at Hawthorn and the club won eight games. Gifted schoolboy from Sandhurst , Graham Arthur , arrived in 1955 and became the second player to win the club’s Best and Fairest in his first year, the other being John Kennedy . Brendan Edwards followed Arthur to Hawthorn in 1956 and, although the seniors showed a slight decline to seven wins and a draw, the reserve grade side gave Hawthorn a first finals appearance in any grade.  , In 1957 the senior team broke through for their first finals appearance, defeating Carlton in the 1st Semi Final long remembered for the freak hailstorm after half-time. It was a surreal look of the MCG covered in golfball size hailstones. They were outclassed by Melbourne in the preliminary final. , After three seasons in mid-table Hawthorn appointed John Kennedy as coach in 1960. Kennedy and 1960 Club Champion Brendan Edwards believed that footballers were not fit enough so a training regime was implemented. John Winneke , Phil Hay , Malcolm Hill , Morton Browne , Ian Mort and Ian Law made their debuts in 1960. Kennedy took the Hawks further than ever before in 1961, winning their first premiership by defeating Footscray . Brendan Edwards was acknowledged as the star of this win. , However, Hawthorn fell back in 1962, winning only five games and finishing in ninth position on the ladder as the club’s modest support base and lack of wealthy supporters limited its ability to compete for the growing number of country recruits joining the VFL.  In 1963 the club finished on top of the ladder only to lose the grand final to Geelong by 49 points. Kennedy accepted a position as Principal of Stawell High School so Graham Arthur became captain-coach in 1964. The Hawks lost the penultimate game to Melbourne and dropped to fifth – had they won they would have finished on top of the ladder. They fell to be last in 1965 with only four wins, and rebuilt the team for the rest of the 1960s. 1966 saw the debut of Peter Crimmins , Des Meagher , Michael Porter and Ray Wilson . , John Kennedy return to coach from 1967. Don Scott , Ian Bremner and Geoff Angus were local recruits. The club convinced Peter Hudson to joining them in 1967 and immediately became the competition’s leading full-forward. In 1968 he kicked 125 goals, the first centurion since John Coleman, and again in 1969 with 120 goals. Despite this, Hawthorn still failed to make the finals, but the acquisition of the powerful Mornington Peninsula recruiting zone gave the club a huge boost in its quest for success and permitted the club a much more powerful list than ever before. In 1968, Kevin Heath and Norm Bussell become members of the senior team and in 1969 two teenagers, Peter Knights and Leigh Matthews , were recruited. , Hawthorn started the 1970s missing the finals even though Peter Hudson kicked a home-and-away record of 146 goals in 1970. The team’s spine was strengthened with the arrival of full back Kelvin Moore and centre half-forward Alan Martello . , In 1971 the Hawks finished on top of the ladder, the first time since 1963, Peter Hudson equalled Bob Pratt 's record of 150 goals in a season and Leigh Matthews won his first of eight club championships. Matthews gained notoriety by shirt fronting Barry Cable in an Interstate Game in Perth. , The 1971 Grand Final was between Hawthorn coached by Hawthorn legend John Kennedy ) and St Kilda coached by Allan Jeans (who would later move to Hawthorn and enjoy success as the Hawks coach in the 1980s). The match was played before 118,192 people at the MCG on a cool and wet Melbourne day. Hawthorn went into the match without inspirational centre half back Peter Knights who had suffered a severe knee injury two weeks earlier. It was a hard and tough game was played out with the Saints leading the Hawks by 20 points going into the last quarter. Hawks 5.7 (37) to the Saints 8.9 (57). For the Saints however, as coach Allan Jeans was to comment, “The season was just 25 minutes too long”. “Kennedy’s Commandos” (the term given to the team after the coach’s tough physical training program and loudly proclaimed in the huge banners that swept around the MCG (now sadly replaced by advertising signs) came into force. The Hawks moved Peter Hudson out to centre half-forward and Bob Keddie into the goal square. The Hawks slammed on seven goals to three in that final quarter, with Keddie kicking four, to run out winners (12.10.82) to the Saints (11.9.75). The final term saw ten goals being scored. , A skinny lad from Berwick made his debut in 1972. Michael Tuck played the first of a record 426 games after Hawthorn lost champion full forward Peter Hudson to a knee injury in the first game of the year. Hudson had kicked 8 goals before being injured before half-time. John Hendrie whose grandfather played in Hawthorn's the first VFL game played the first of 197 games for the club. , During the 1970s a strong rivalry grew with North Melbourne and they met in three grand finals with the Hawks prevailing twice. The 1976 Grand Final team was inspired by the illness of former Captain Peter Crimmins who died 3 days after the victory from cancer, and by the humiliating defeat of the 1975 Grand Final loss to the North Melbourne Kangaroos. The Hawks greats such as the prolific goal-kicker Michael Moncrieff , rover Leigh Matthews , ruck rover Michael Tuck , ruckman Don Scott , full back Kelvin Moore and centre half-back Peter Knights played through this era. The Hawthorn North Melbourne clash was a close encounter, but injuries to champions such as Keith Greig and Brent Crosswell made North’s chances of winning difficult. However, when Hawthorn looked threatened, they replied quickly and kept their lead intact. The forward line won the day and as a result it was not surprising that John Hendrie was voted best on ground by radio and newspapers of the day. , After the disappointment of losing to North Melbourne in the 1977 Preliminary Final, the Hawks were back to play in the 1978 Grand Final , again against North Melbourne. It was the third time in four seasons that these two sides were to meet in a grand final. North Melbourne were competing in their fifth successive grand final and were the reigning premiers. At half-time North Melbourne led by four points but Hawthorn finished victors by three goals thanks largely to a strong third quarter which saw them kick 7.6. The turning point occurred when two North players spoiled each other in the goalsquare at the 6-minute mark, when a mark and a goal could have put them 17 points up. The Hawks went on to dominate play after this incident and never looked back. , Their greatest era was undoubtedly the 1980s, where the team won four premierships and played in the grand final seven years in succession, including three in a row against arch-enemy Essendon . The decade started poorly, with Hawthorn failing to finish in the top five (as it was then known) and seen by most critics as a spent force. Coach David Parkin left and agreed to coach Carlton and captain Don Scott would shortly retire after playing his 300th game. In a surprise appointment Hawthorn persuaded former St Kilda premiership coach Allan Jeans to coach the team. Jeans had not coached in the VFL for five years. , 1982 would mark the start of Hawthorn being in the finals for 13 years in a row. Hawthorn returned to finals football in 1982, finishing second after the home and away season, Hawthorn fans saw Subiaco champion Gary Buckenara for the first time and also a cameo appearance of Gary Ablett in a Hawthorn jumper and Dermott Brereton who was a skinny kid from Frankston made his debut in the semi final against North Melbourne and kicked five goals. Hawthorn lost the Preliminary Final to Carlton by 31 points. , The first of four premierships for the decade was in the 1983 Grand Final , with Hawthorn 20.20 (140) defeating Essendon 8.9 (57) This was at that time a record margin in a grand final; signifying the juggernaut that Hawthorn was to become during the 1980s. Hawthorn competed in the next two grand finals against rival Essendon, losing the 1984 Grand Final due to Essendon’s famous final quarter charge, and losing the 1985 Grand Final by a far greater margin; souring the final game of club legend Leigh Matthews. Playing alongside him was young Jason Dunstall , from Coorparoo , Queensland, he was recruited after winning the QAFL goalkicking in 1984. , Their second premiership came the following year in the 1986 Grand Final , with Hawthorn 16.14 (110) defeating Carlton 9.14 (68) convincingly, with Gary Ayres winning his first of two Norm Smith Medals. 1987 saw Hawthorn finish second to a superior Carlton team. The fact that Hawthorn even made it to the grand final is still the centre of some controversy; with Gary Buckenara’a after the siren kick in the 1987 Preliminary Final breaking the hearts of tens of thousands of Melbourne supporters. , Ill health to coach Allan Jeans meant that Football Operations Manager Alan Joyce took the coaching position for 1988. The Hawks lost only 3 games for the year; Jason Dunstall kicked 132 goals and the team would win the 1988 Premiership 22.20 (152) against Melbourne 6.20 (56); a then record margin in a Grand Final of 96 points. Gary Ayres won his second Norm Smith Medal. , The 1989 season was viewed as one of the most spectacular VFL/AFL seasons to date; with Dunstall again kicking a century of goals, the resurgence of Geelong and dominating play of Geelong great Gary Ablett Sr. , and the greatest grand final of the modern era occurring in this year. , The Hawks defeated Geelong in the 1989 Grand Final. The match is now legendary for its amazing toughness, physicality, skill, massive scoring and tension. The Hawks jumped out to an enormous lead as Geelong attempted to unsettle the Hawks through rough physical play. However the physical toll on the Hawks began to show as the match wore on; with John Platten being concussed, Robert DiPierdomenico puncturing his lung, Dermott Brereton breaking his ribs and Michael Tuck splitting the webbing on his hand.  By midway through the final quarter the Cats were charging; with Hawthorn desperately trying to hold off the Cats’ avalanche of goals while containing the brilliance of Ablett who ended the match with a grand final record of 9 goals. Hawthorn’s experience and determination allowed them to hold off Geelong just long enough, scraping through to victory by one goal.  , Other clubs have had success since but none have matched the sustained dominance of the Hawks in the late 1980s, having played in a record seven successive grand finals. Leading players of the 1980s included Dermott Brereton , Gary Ayres, Chris Mew , Michael Tuck , Jason Dunstall , Gary Buckenara , John Platten and Chris Langford . , The Hawks ended their era of dominance which included eight grand final appearances in nine seasons (1983–1991). Injuries to key personnel hampered Hawthorns 1990 campaign. Jason Dunstall and Dermott Brereton both missed many games, others like Robert DiPierdomenico carried injuries into the finals. The Hawks bowed out in the Elimination Final to Melbourne. Alan Joyce replaced Allan Jeans as coach for the 1991 season and the Hawks subsequently won the pre-season cup. The club recruited skillful South Australian Darren Jarman and with improvement from young players, such as Paul Hudson , Ben Allan and Stephen Lawrence the team made the 1991 Grand Final . , Grand Final Day 1991 was an historic occasion. It was the only grand final played at Waverley Park and featured the first ever appearance by a non-Victorian team. West Coast had dominated the home and away season but Hawthorn, written off by many early in the season, won the match. West Coast began the match kicking with the aid of a strong wind blowing down to the main scoreboard end and kicked the opening four goals. However, from that point the Hawks began to gain the ascendancy and, if not for inaccuracy in front of goal in the second term, they would have had a significant half-time lead. Having maintained the half-time margin, against the wind, in the third term, the Hawks scored 8.4 (52) to 1.3 (9) in the final quarter, to win a fifth premiership in nine seasons. A feature of the Hawks’ performance was that its two best players—Paul Dear and Stephen Lawrence—were from the team’s younger brigade. It was Michael Tuck ’s last game and he bowed out with the League record for games (426), finals (39), grand finals (11) and premierships (7). At the end of 1991, Hawthorn selected a young Shane Crawford with pick 13 in the National Draft, who eventually became the only surviving link between this era of success and its next triumph 17 seasons later. During the 1992 summer, the Hawthorn players’ T-shirts had "Too old. Too slow. Too good" written on them.  , After having shared Princes Park with Carlton as a home venue since 1974, Hawthorn began to move its home games to Waverley Park in Mulgrave in Melbourne’s south-east in 1990. The club played five home games at Waverley Park and the balance at Princes Park in each of 1990 and 1991, and played all home games at Waverley Park from 1992.  To further strengthen their links with the area a second social club was established nearby at the Waverley Gardens shopping centre. The club, which operates as a gaming venue, has also been a lucrative source of revenue for the club. , The end of the 1993 season saw the first cracks in the Family Club facade; coach Alan Joyce was replaced by Peter Knights and club legends Gary Ayres and Dermott Brereton departed. Chris Mew injured his achilles tendon and retired. Behind the scenes the Hawthorn board began to spend large amounts of money that the club didn't have, board members flew first class to games interstate and $1 million was spent renovating club offices by a company owned by the then club president. Despite a decade of onfield success, the club failed to attract supporters who would become long term backers for the club. Loss of key players continued, Ben Allan was offered the captaincy of the new Fremantle Dockers and left at the end of 1994, as did Andrew Gowers , who went to Brisbane . , After a promising start in 1995 the Hawks lost their last seven games to finish fifteenth and missed the finals for the first time since 1981. The board sacked the coaching staff and appointed Ken Judge who was an assistant to David Parkin at Carlton. Club Champion Darren Jarman told the club he wanted to return to Adelaide. , Falling on-field and off-field fortune saw the club almost merge with Melbourne in 1996. The resulting club was to be known as the " Melbourne Hawks " – a fusion with the Melbourne nickname of "Demons". A groundswell of support led by former champion Don Scott scuttled the proposal, with Hawthorn members voting strongly against it. Melbourne members supported the merger by a small margin. The failure of the merger led to the resignation of the board and its replacement, led by businessman Ian Dicker. , After fighting off the merger the new board launched the “Proud, Passionate and Paid Up” campaign in a bid to get more members. 27,450 memberships were bought by supporters, more than doubling the memberships from the previous year. Even in the successful years of the 1980s the club struggled to get 10,000 members. The team won the 1999 pre-season competition but missed out on the finals of the premiership season. Ken Judge resigned at the end of 1999 to accept the coaching job at West Coast Eagles . , Peter Schwab was appointed coach of the Hawks for the 2000 season and the team played a more attacking style than the “accountable football” discipline of Ken Judge. The Hawks reached the semi-finals before losing to the reigning premiers, the North Melbourne Football Club . The team made steady progress all over the field. Daniel Chick and Nick Holland were the joint winners of the Peter Crimmins Medal. Chance Bateman became the second Indigenous Australian to play for Hawthorn. , In 2001 the Hawks again enjoyed a successful year, but it was to be their last for several seasons. The Hawks won eight games straight at the start of the season and, despite faltering late in the home-and-away season, had a close win in a semi-final against Port Adelaide and made it to the preliminary finals in when they narrowly lost to Essendon . In the off-season, Hawthorn traded Trent Croad and Luke McPharlin for the Number 1 draft pick, Luke Hodge , No. 20 (Daniel Elstone) and No. 36 ( Sam Mitchell ). Croad would, ironically, return to Hawthorn two years later. , The Hawks missed the finals altogether in 2002, finishing tenth, which was considered a very disappointing result for the club. Shane Crawford won the Peter Crimmins Medal after another strong season. Players that made their debuts that year, Luke Hodge , Sam Mitchell , Campbell Brown , Robert Campbell and Mark Williams would all play in the 2008 premiership side. In the off-season, the Hawks again proved to be big players and gained the services of St Kilda ruckman Peter Everitt . , After a poor start to the 2003 season, the Hawks went on to finish the second half of the year strongly and finished in ninth position, narrowly missing the finals. Sam Mitchell shone for the Hawks and won the AFL Rising Star award. This form had punters excited and the team were early favourites for a top four finish the next year. Shane Crawford once again won the Peter Crimmins Medal and also came second in the Brownlow Medal by a single vote. , During the 2004 pre-season Hawthorn coach Peter Schwab declared that the Hawks would “win the premiership” although this statement would be followed by a horrific season for Hawthorn as the Hawks managed just four wins and eighteen losses. The club imploded, and by mid-season coach Peter Schwab was sacked, and Captain Shane Crawford broke his arm, and eventually relinquished the captaincy. Following the collapse of the club on the field, many players either left or were sacked from the club. Nathan Thompson left the club citing a fresh start following his admission that he suffered from depression. Rayden Tallis , Mark Graham , Kris Barlow and Lance Picioane were also released from the club. More than 700 games of experience left the club following the season. , Main articles = Hawthorn Football Club seasons 2007 , 2008 , 2009 , 2010 , 2011 , 2012 , 2013 and 2014 , Alastair Clarkson was appointed to his first senior AFL coaching role at the Hawthorn Football Club for the 2005 season, when the Hawks embarked to rebuild the team. Clarkson was prepared to delist older players and instill a youth policy. Club veterans Rayden Tallis , Mark Graham , Kris Barlow , Luke McCabe and Lance Picioane left the club while Nathan Thompson was trade to North Melbourne . The Hawks took Jarryd Roughead , Lance Franklin , Jordan Lewis at picks 2, 5 and 7 respectively in the AFL Draft . With Clarkson at the helm, the Hawks made solid progress, and instituted a culture of discipline at the club. The Hawks won only five games and by playing a high-possession game plan and finished in 14th position. Hawks fans saw a somewhat successful introduction to the AFL for players Franklin, Roughead and Lewis all of whom won Rising Star Nominations. Shane Crawford also had a return to form after a terrible 2004 when he broke his arm, and finished 3rd in the Peter Crimmins Medal tally. , Former number one draft pick Luke Hodge had a breakthrough season in 2005, winning the Peter Crimmins Medal , All-Australian jumper and coming equal 4th in the Brownlow Medal (15 votes) from half-back. Peter Everitt and Trent Croad were also named in the All-Australian team. After 2005, another round of culling and the club bid farewell to Angelo Lekkas , Nick Holland . Hawthorn recruited Xavier Ellis (pick 3), Beau Dowler (pick 6), Grant Birchall (pick 14), Max Bailey (pick 18) and Beau Muston (pick 22) all early in the draft; two of those selections were received by trading 2001 All-Australian full-back Jonathan Hay to North Melbourne and Nathan Lonie to Port Adelaide . , After numerous years of planning, the club relocated its administrative headquarters from Glenferrie Oval to a state-of-the-art redeveloped facility at Waverley Park in the early stages of 2006. Glenferrie Oval was to remain the spiritual home of the club. , In 2006, Clarkson showed innovation by restructuring the forwards into a system that came known as “Buddy’s box”. Starting the season 4–1 after the first five rounds, the Hawks faltered and lost twelve of the next thirteen games to fall to 5–13. The team won the final four matches to finish eleventh. Hawthorn’s progress up the ladder, developing youth, and attacking style of play saw coach Alastair Clarkson rewarded with a new 2-year contract after the mid-season break. , At the end of the 2006 season, the Hawks increased their commitment to the Tasmanian market – where they had developed a large support base – with four games to be played at Aurora Stadium in Launceston each year, and with the Tasmanian Government becoming an official sponsor of the club, in one of the biggest sponsorship deals in Australian sporting history,  worth $15–20 million. , Clarkson brought to the club delisted footballers Brent Guerra and Stephen Gilham who he knew from his time at Port Adelaide . The Hawks continued to improve in 2007, winning 13 games and finishing fifth on the Premiership table. This took them into the finals, where they defeated Adelaide in the Elimination Final, in which Lance Franklin kicked his seventh goal seconds from the final siren, before being eliminated in the Semi Final against North Melbourne . The club recorded its 11th consecutive year-end profit at the close of the 2007 season, a record A$ 3.6 million. , On Draft day 2007 Clarkson went against his own policy when he recruited recently retired Stuart Dew and youngster Cyril Rioli . Clarkson also introduced a new style of play that became known as the "Clarkson Cluster". , Throughout the 2008 AFL season , Hawthorn played a brand of football which became described as "unsociable" – a rough, physical style of play which conceded a lot of free kicks, but regardless asserted a physical dominance for the club.  Hawthorn finished second on the home-and-away ladder with a record of 17–5, and progressed to the Grand Final to defeat Geelong 18.7 (115) to 11.23 (89), who had lost only one match during the season.  Hawthorn would go on to lose its next eleven encounters with Geelong, allegedly caused by the " Kennett curse ". Lance Franklin won the Coleman Medal with 102 goals, becoming the first player for more than a decade to score 100 goals within the home-and-away season. , The 2008 Grand Final would become the last game for Trent Croad and Shane Crawford in their AFL careers – Crawford retired after the season, with 305 games service, and Croad suffered a foot injury during the Grand Final which kept him out of the following season, ultimately leading to his retirement. After the 2008 premiership, opposition teams worked hard at picking the "Clarkson cluster" apart, masked by injuries to key players the Hawks slipped down the ladder to finished ninth in 2009. The Hawks premiership defence ended with them missing the finals altogether. , A poor start to 2010 when the club lost six out its first seven games the team finally abandoned the cluster for a more precision kicking style. The change resulted in eleven wins, only three losses and a draw followed, and it was enough for them to make the finals, finishing seventh and drawing an away final against the Fremantle Dockers in Perth, which they lost by 30 points. , Aided by recruiting established players to cover weaknesses the club climbed its way back up the ladder. Shaun Burgoyne and Josh Gibson arrived in 2010, David Hale in 2011, Jack Gunston in 2012 and Brian Lake in 2013 helped Clarkson again guided the Hawks to a premiership win, this time over the Fremantle in the 2013 AFL Grand Final . , In 2011, Hawthorn finished the home and away season with a record of 18–4, finishing third. It lost to Collingwood by three points in a preliminary final. In a reasonably unheralded season Hawthorn won 18 games. Lance Franklin won the Coleman Medal and an All Australian guernsey; Josh Gibson, Sam Mitchell and Grant Birchall were also nominated for All Australian positions. , In 2012, Hawthorn finished on top of the home and away season ladder with a record of 17–5, finishing as minor premiers for the first time since 1989 . They defeated Collingwood and Adelaide by 38 and 5 points respectively to advance to their second Grand Final in five years, however, despite leading by two goals midway through the final term they were defeated by the Sydney Swans by 10 points. , In 2013, Hawthorn again finished as minor premiers after a home and away season record of 19–3. During the season Jarryd Roughead won the John Coleman Medal for the first time. The club also traded for Brian Lake , an experienced defender from the Western Bulldogs. Lake went on to win the Norm Smith Medal for his efforts in the Grand Final . Hawthorn defeated the Fremantle Dockers by 15 points to claim their 11th premiership after a tough and scrappy game. Team mates joining Lake as premiership players who began their careers at other clubs were Jonathan Simpkin , Jack Gunston (runner-up in Norm Smith voting with his 4 goals), David Hale , Shaun Burgoyne , Josh Gibson and Brent Guerra . , In 2014 the club was able to overcome adversity to win their twelfth premiership. Former leading goalkicker Lance Franklin left the club as a free agent soon after the 2013 premiership, linking up with the Sydney Swans on a multi-million dollar contract over nine years, new recruit Dayle Garlett retired before the start of the season, and coach Alastair Clarkson missed a month due to illness (during which Brendon Bolton acted as caretaker coach for five matches). The 2014 premiership saw Will and Chris Langford become the first father/son premiership players at the club since Peter Hudson (1971) and his son Paul (1991) (Chris' teammate John Kennedy Jr played in four premierships, whilst his father John Kennedy, Sr. coached the club to three flags.). , Includes the Peter Crimmins Medal (Best and Fairest) winners.  , When Hawthorn entered the VFL in 1925 their nickname was known as The Mayblooms . The maybloom was a flower that was profuse in the Hawthorn suburban area. In Round 2, 1943 when Hawthorn played Essendon , the match report in the Sporting Globe newspaper announced that prior to the start of the game at Glenferrie, Roy Cazaly , Hawthorn’s coach told the players that in future they would be known as the Hawks instead of the Mayblooms. Cazaly said I expect players to live up to the name being ready to fight hard and carry the ball away with pace and dash to the goal.  , The Hawthorn FC has had four VFL/AFL endorsed logos in its entirety. The first (1977), a flying Hawk, was an adaptation of a pre-existing unofficial logo that appeared on the club's official documentation throughout the 1960s and 1970s. The Hawks's Mascot Manor representative and club mascot is Hudson "Hawka" Knights, a caricature of a hawk dressed the same way as the Hawthorn players and slightly depicting club champion Dermott Brereton . , The Hawthorn colours are Brown & Gold vertical stripes. Hawthorn has worn this design since 1950. The current major sponsors of the team are Tasmania , iiNet , Bupa and Adidas . The standard home guernsey is used in all home and away games in Victoria, Sydney and Tasmania while the away guernsey is used in every away game in Adelaide, Perth and Brisbane. , The club's colours and designs have changed a few times during their history. From 1902 to 1904 they wore a blue guernsey with red shoulders and a red stripe down the front of the guernsey along with blue and white hooped socks. After they merged with Boroondara in 1905 they changed to a black guernsey with a red sash with black and red hooped socks. After the club had struggled for a few years it was decided to reform it and for seasons 1912–13 and they wore a yellow guernsey with a blue V. Upon entering the VFA they had to change their colours again as Williamstown already had that combination and adopted the colours brown and gold which have since remained to this day although the design has changed a few times, the main ones being: , The Hawthorn club song is entitled We're a Happy Team at Hawthorn , and is sung to the tune of The Yankee Doodle Boy which was written by George M. Cohen for his 1904 musical Little Johnny Jones . In the musical Johnny Jones is a patriotic US jockey competing in England. , The song gained prominence when it was featured in the wartime 1942 musical Yankee Doodle Dandy starring James Cagney as George M Cohen performing the part of Johnny Jones on stage! , The song was adapted with new Hawthorn lyrics by Chick Lander in 1956. , The closure of Waverley Park in 1999 was a setback as Hawthorn could no longer play home games in the south-east region where they have developed a large support base. Home games were moved to the Melbourne Cricket Ground . Their relationship with the south-east was rekindled in 2006, when the Hawks returned to Waverley as a training and administration centre. The oval and a section of the Sir Kenneth Luke stand have been retained by developer Mirvac as part of their redevelopment of the Waverley site as a housing estate, largely as a result of a Victorian government commitment to keep football there. Mirvac leases the facility to Hawthorn for a peppercorn rent, until the club takes ownership of the facility within the next 20 years. Hawthorn will maintain their association with Glenferrie, by housing several coteries and conducting social activities at the club's spiritual home. , On 30 September 2008, the Hawthorn Football Club relationship with Glenferrie Oval was rekindled when the club hosted a Supporters Day at the club's spiritual home celebrating the club's 10th premiership, attended by an estimated 20,000 fans. On the 29 September 2013, the Hawthorn Football Club shared the spoils with their supporters again at Glenferrie Oval, celebrating the club's 11th premiership with more than 22,000 fans in attendance. , In August 2005, former Victorian State Premier Jeff Kennett , a long time Hawthorn supporter and former number one membership ticket holder, was appointed to the board of the club with the intention of standing for president at the next coming Annual General Meeting . His rise to presidency was confirmed when on 14 December 2005, he was ushered in as president of the Hawthorn Football Club unopposed to the audience of a packed Hawthorn Town Hall. , Since 2001 Hawthorn has successfully cultivated a following in Tasmania, where the membership base has increased from 1,000 to more than 9,000. Since 2006, Hawthorn has increased its presence in the state as part of an agreement with the tourism component of the Tasmanian government, whereby they are contracted to play four games in the state and the Tasmanian Government will be the major sponsor for the club. This relationship was renewed for a further period for five years (2012–16) in November 2011. Subject to AFL consent Hawthorn has offered to play an additional home game in Tasmania as part of the new deal, provided the number of rounds in the home/away season is increased by the AFL to accommodate an 18 team competition.  , At their 2007 Annual General Meeting, Hawthorn embarked on a 5-year business plan titled "five2fifty", the core idea being that in the next five years the club will target to win 2 premierships and have fifty thousand members. As part of the plan, the football club wants to be seen as the most professional club in the AFL, and places great emphasis on the welfare of the people associated with the club.  , Following the completion of 'five2fifty' business plan in 2012, Hawthorn released a new business plan; 'All for One'. Striving for 80,000 plus members and investing a further $35m into capital investment projects in and around Waverley Park; the Hawks have set themselves an objective to become 'the destination club'; targeting successive top 4 finishes over the 2013-2017 period. Central to successfully achieving its commercial objectives, the Hawks have identified the importance of solidifying its status as a major MCG tenant as crucial to growing its membership and crowd support.  , In 2009 Hawthorn launched a community-based program called 'HANZ-UP! AFL Program' in New Zealand. The Hawks announced they had entered the New Zealand market, with an initial three-year deal with an option to extend the partnership until the end of 2018. , Hawthorn has joined with AFLNZ to promote HANZ-UP! through programs such as KiwiKick (a New Zealand version of Auskick), the Hawks Cup (a year-9 and year-10 schools competition) and the Trent Croad Scholarship Scheme (AFL international scholarships). Annual skills clinics will also be held throughout New Zealand featuring Hawthorn players. KiwiKick will see all participants receiving kits branded with the Hawks and HANZ-UP! logos, while Hawks Cup players will be given exclusive Hawthorn merchandise.  , The Hawthorn Football Club financial year ends on 31 October each year. , Hawthorn boasts a huge support base throughout Australia, particularly in Victoria and Tasmania. In a survey appearing in the 9/7/2008 edition of the Herald Sun, 11% of respondents barracked for Hawthorn, behind only Collingwood (14%), Essendon (12%) and Carlton (12%). As an MCG tenant, Hawthorn is among the top 5 crowd drawing clubs in the league, averaging crowds of more than 50,000 to their MCG home games since 2008.  Since 1997, Hawthorn has drawn the 5th largest crowds to home and away matches, drawing more than 36,000 per game across all home and away games. , Notable supporters include former Victorian Premier and former club President Jeff Kennett , cricketers Ian Healy , Mark Taylor , Terry Alderman and Damien Fleming , champion tennis players Pat Cash , Mark Philippoussis & Jarmila Gajdošová , Melbourne Storm captain Cameron Smith ,  Australian Olympic Rower James Tomkins , basketball legend Andrew Gaze , media personalities Stephen Quartermain , Helen Kapalos , Anthony Lehmann , the late Graeme "Shirley" Strachan and television host Shura Taft .  , Most of this widespread support can be accredited to the club's success in the 1970s and 1980s as the club successfully nurtured talent in its home ‘zones’ – primarily in the South and East of Victoria, as well as recruiting interstate talent from all over Australia. As a result, the club has a very widespread membership with 7,000 Tasmanian members, 3,000 WA members and 3,000 QLD and NSW members complementing the club's 45,000 Victorian members. In 2007 Hawthorn stated its ambitions were to grow their membership to beyond 50,000 by 2011 which was achieved in 2009. By 2012, Hawthorn became just the second club to grow membership beyond 60,000 setting a goal of reaching 80,000 plus members by 2017. , In 2008 the Hawthorn Football Club drew 1,164,396 to all 25 completed games, a club record and 7th largest aggregate attendance for any club, of all time. In May 2009, the Hawthorn Football Club boasted the largest membership in the AFL, becoming the first Victorian club to break the 51,000 barrier for membership. In all, Hawthorn has drawn more than 1,000,000 fans to AFL matches in 5 seasons - 2008 and 2011–2014. , Hawthorn's official membership figures 1925-1983  (* indicates official figure was an estimate) , The table below also contains crowd figures along with club membership numbers from 1984. Total attendance includes finals matches. , – ¹ as of 16 June 2015 , Head coach , Assistant coaches , , On 6 March 2011, at its annual Family Day, club representatives announced that as of the 2011 season the No. 1 guernsey would be officially retired as a player number and instead presented as a tribute to the fans. Max Bailey , who was the last player to wear #1, made the announcement by saying, "..the fans are number 1." , He then presented the cheersquad with a giant Hawthorn guernsey displaying "1" on its back. The oversized guernsey will be on display at selected home games. , Legend: Finals , Wooden spoon , , The following is a list of coaches of the Hawthorn Football Club. , Legend: P = Played, W = Won, L = Lost, D = Drew, W% = Win percentage , The following is a list of Presidents of the Hawthorn Football Club. , Hawthorn's "Best & Fairest Award" is called the Peter Crimmins Medal in honour of former Hawthorn captain Peter Crimmins who played as a rover during 1966–1975 and led the side in 1974–75. He died of cancer just days after the club's 1976 premiership win. , The match committee now awards the votes. The player with the maximum number of votes at the conclusion of the season is awarded the medal. (See Season Summaries for the complete list of winners.) , Note: Before 2002, this was the VFL/AFL Players Association Most Valuable Player award. In 2005, all winners of this honour prior to 2002 were retrospectively awarded the Leigh Matthews Trophy. , During the history of the Hawthorn Football Club, the club has had four mainstay home grounds (Glenferrie Oval, Princes Park, Waverley Park and the Melbourne Cricket Ground). Prior to adopting Glenferrie Oval as the club's traditional home the club had a nomadic history, playing home games at whatever the most suitable obtainable ground was for that season. Their first home ground, the Hawthorn C.G. (West Hawthorn Reserve) was abandoned after the first season due to conditions imposed by the Hawthorn Cricket Club and they played at John Wren's Richmond Racecourse in 1903 (which was off Bridge Road between Stawell Street and Westbank Terrace – where Tudor Street and 5 no through streets are now located) and moved to the Richmond Cricket Ground in 1904. Their merger with Boroondara in 1905 had them move to Boroondara's ground, which at the time was the East Melbourne Cricket Ground. Hawthorn dropped their colours of blue and red (similar to Melbourne's guernsey at the time) and adopted Boroondara's colours, which was a black guernsey with red sash but retained the name Hawthorn FC. When the Hawthorn council opened the Hawthorn City Sports Ground (Glenferrie Oval) in October 1905 they endeavored to get a senior club to represent the district to be the main tenant during the next football season. The Hawthorn FC, competing in the Metropolitan Junior Football Association (now known as the VAFA), and Hawthorn Rovers (a popular club in the Eastern Suburbs Association) merged to form the Hawthorn City Football Club and made Glenferrie their home ground (the word City was later dropped and the club was just known as the Hawthorn Football Club when it entered the VFA in 1914) . , Between 1906 and 1973, home games were played at the club's traditional home, Glenferrie Oval, in the heart of the affluent suburb. The state of Glenferrie Oval and its location, close by the Glenferrie train station on the Melbourne East route, was a central reason why the club was firstly accepted into the VFA in 1914, and then the VFL in 1925. The club's onfield results had not reached any great heights in those early days but both the VFA and VFL had recognised the importance for representation in the suburbs east of the Yarra River. Glenferrie Oval was pivotal in these advancements of the Hawthorn Football Club as it was considered the most suitable at the time. , In 1914, when Hawthorn entered the VFA, the council was required to build a new dressing shed to meet the standards of the VFA competition. These dressing sheds were erected in the north-west corner of the ground, where the Tuck Stand now resides, and were later moved to the Rathmines Road Reserve in Hawthorn where it still exists today. In 1922 the ground was widened by 30 yards and lengthened westward by 50 yards - taking in the previous outer reserve ground - to the dimensions that remain today. The 1922 ground improvements also resulted in Glenferrie Oval's first main stand, which was a wooden structure to be known as the Kennon-Owen Stand, and had been purchased from the East Melbourne Cricket Ground in late 1921 when that ground was closed due to expansion of the Jolimont railyards. The Kennon-Owen Stand was located where the Victorian Weightlifting Building is now situated. Glenferrie Oval is universally known for its famous art-deco Grandstand, built in 1937 and later named the Michael Tuck stand after the club great, and housed the new changerooms and administration of the club. It is now heritage protected as one of the most significant buildings of the era. The Kennon-Owen Stand was replaced by the Dr A S Ferguson Stand, a new brick stand opened in 1966 which was 185 feet long and could seat 1450, with 400 undercover. It was later to be home of the Past Players Association and the original Museum. The northern part of the Ferguson stand was demolished to make way for the Victorian Weightlifting Building. In 1963 the large scoreboard was erected at the eastern end of the ground. After the club won the 1961 premiership it was decided to buy some houses on the other side of Linda Crescent to build the Social Club which opened in 1962. The ground was relatively small by VFL standards, but the intimate nature of the ground (with the grandstands and train line surrounding the ground) made for a terrific atmosphere. , The club ceased playing VFL matches at the ground in 1973 to cater for the club's growing crowds and demands of VFL football. From 1974–2006, the club used the ground as a home and administration base, conducting training sessions and running a social club, across on Linda Crescent, before moving the administrative base to Waverley Park in 2007. The club used Glenferrie Oval for its post-premiership celebrations in 2008, attracting more than 20,000 fans. , The decision to move away from Glenferrie Oval and subsequent move to Princes Park , was a difficult transition, alienating many supporters. Prior to moving to Princes Park, the club pushed to build a stadium in Box Hill and mooted a move to the MCG (1964) both were rejected. The move to Princes Park – the traditional home of the Carlton Football Club, coincided with the club's golden era, hoisting the '76, '78, '83, '86, '88, '89 and '91 premiership flags at the ground. Combined with Carlton's '79, '81, '82 and '87 flags, Princes Park became a hub of success throughout the 1970s and 1980s. , Whilst the club had immense success at the ground, the ground wasn't a favourite with the majority of the Hawthorn membership. Located in Melbourne's Northern suburbs, the traditional home of the Carlton Football Club – one of the traditional powerhouses of the VFL, the move away from the club's heartland caused many Hawks supporters to turn their back on the club. , Recognising this, as early as the mid-1980s the Hawthorn administration pushed to relocate from Princes Park to Waverley Park, however due to the nature of long term terms of tenancy at Princes Park and ruthlessness of the Carlton Football Club for Hawthorn to abide by this contract, a move away from Princes Park before the end of the long term agreement would result in financial ruin for the club. , In 1990, with the backing of the AFL, Hawthorn set the wheels in motion for a move to VFL Park, playing a series of home games at Waverley Park – located 20 km east of the Melbourne CBD and location of Hawthorn's 1991 Premiership success. Whilst the move to Waverley was met with a drop in on-field success, symbolising the birth of the barren period for the club on the field leading up until 2008, the club successfully harboured large increases in attendances and membership at the ground. , As a result of the AFL closing the venue and subsequently selling the property to Mirvac to finance the Docklands stadia, the club had the opportunity to move home games to either the lavish new Docklands precinct (alongside Essendon, St Kilda, Western Bulldogs and North Melbourne) or join traditional tenants Melbourne and Richmond as well as Collingwood at the MCG. Highlighting the potential to push attendances and membership beyond 50,000, the club decided to push for a relocation to the MCG in line with the 'Family Club' mantra. , In January 2006, in the club's centennial year at Glenferrie Oval, the club's administration, museum and player base relocated to Waverley Park. , On 13 March 2000, Hawthorn played its first home game as an MCG tenant against Collingwood, becoming one of four tenant clubs to play at the ground. Until 2008 the shift from to the MCG has been met with a barren period on the field for the Hawks, having played in five out of nine non-finals seasons at the ground. , Since 2000, Hawthorn has played between seven to nine home games at the MCG, with secondary home games being played at Docklands Stadium and York Park in Tasmania. In 2008, Hawthorn played seven home games at the MCG, drawing 369,614 (52,802) to seven games and a total of 773,089 (59,468) to 13 games at the venue for the year.  , Since 2001, Hawthorn's has played "secondary" home games at York Park (currently also known by the sponsorship name of Aurora Stadium) in Tasmania. The Hawks have a very successful record at the ground, losing only two games played there since 2010.  As a result of the agreement with the Tasmanian government, thousands of Melbourne-based Hawthorn supporters have travelled to Tasmania to watch the Hawks play, increasing activity within the local Launceston economy. By the same token, Hawthorn has successfully increased its following in the state, with an estimated 25% of young Tasmanian supporters now barracking for their "local" team.  , Hawthorn fielded a reserves team in the VFL/AFL reserves competition, and its successor, the Victorian State Football League , from 1925 until 1999. During that time, the club won four reserves premierships: in 1958, 1959, 1972 and 1985. , Since 2000, after the VSFL ceased competition, Hawthorn has been affiliated with the Box Hill Football Club in the Victorian Football League . Under the affiliaton, Hawthorn players who are not selected in the AFL can play alongside Box Hill senior players in the VFL competition. The clubs have a strong affiliation, with Box Hill changing its club nickname from Mustangs to Hawks when the sides affiliated. Box Hill has won two premierships, in 2001 and 2013, during the period of the clubs' affiliation. , The reserve grade won the club's first flag after holding onto a winning lead by defeating Collingwood by four points. After an even first quarter the Hawks kicked four unanswered goals to lead by 26 points at half time. Collingwood lifted after the break keeping the Hawks to a goal in the third and only a point in the final quarter. Playing better football in wet conditions, Collingwood managed to narrow the gap but inaccurate kicking they failed by four points. Gary Young kicked four goals while Elward kicked two. , In 1959 Hawthorn Reserves went back to back winning their second premiership after defeating Fitzroy by 31 points. The Hawks opened up a 38-point half time lead by kicking six goals in the second quarter. The hawks extended their lead to 44 points at the last break before playing it safe and coasting to a 31-point win. Elward and Peter Hay kicked 3 goals for the winners and Dineen, Howell and Ritchie were amongst their best players , In a team that contained four of the previous years senior premiership players, Geoff Angus , Ken Beck , Michael Porter and Ray Wilson . Up and coming future club champions Michael Moncrieff , Michael Tuck , Kelvin Matthews and Alan Goad were instrumental in the match. The Hawks led all day before Melbourne hit the front with two minutes to go, a late goal to Fitzgerald won the game. , In 1985, Hawthorn Reserves contained future premiership players in James Morrissey , Greg Dear , Peter Curran , Chris Wittman and Paul Abbott . Hawthorn veterans, Peter Knights , Gary Buckenara , Rodney Eade and Colin Robertson and in his only year at the club Steve Malaxos . Buckenara kicked 8 goals. , Hawthorn fielded a side in the VFL Under 19 competition. The Under 19s played in two grand finals, losing the first in 1969 to Richmond but in 1972 won against North Melbourne. The team included Bernie Jones , Ron Beattie , Michael Zemski and Ian Scrimshaw. ,  ( A sound mind in a healthy body ) , The Carlton Football Club , nicknamed The Blues , is a professional Australian rules football club based in Melbourne . The club competes in the Australian Football League , and was one of the eight founding members of that competition in 1897. The club originally represented the suburb of Carlton in Melbourne's inner north, and its nickname comes from the navy blue colour which it has traditionally worn in its playing uniform. It is based at Princes Park in Carlton, and played its home matches there throughout most of its history, but currently plays its home matches at either Docklands Stadium (currently known as Etihad Stadium) or the Melbourne Cricket Ground . Carlton has historically been one of the AFL's most successful clubs, having won sixteen senior premierships throughout its history, equal with Essendon as the most of any club. , , , Carlton has had a long and successful history. Together with fierce rivals Collingwood , Richmond and Essendon , Carlton was considered historically to be one of the league's "Big Four" clubs, and enjoys a healthy rivalry with all three others.  , The Carlton Football Club was formed in July 1864. In the early days, Carlton became particularly strong and having grown a large supporter base became a fierce rival to the Melbourne Football Club in early competition including the Caledonian Challenge Cup , which it dominated in the 1870s. In 1877, Carlton became one of the foundation clubs of the Victorian Football Association , and was a comfortable winner of the premiership in the competition's inaugural season.  , Carlton was one of first clubs to have a player worthy of the superstar tag: champion player George Coulthard , who played for Carlton between 1876 and 1882, and was noted by The Australasian as 'The grandest player of the day'. He died of tuberculosis in 1883, aged 27. , The club won one more VFA premiership, in 1887, but after that, particularly during the 1890s, the club went from one of the strongest clubs in the Association to one of the weaker, both on-field and off-field. In spite of this, the club was invited to join the breakaway Victorian Football League competition in 1897.  The club continued to struggle in early seasons of the new competition, and finished seventh out of eight teams in each of its first five seasons. , Carlton's fortunes improved significantly in 1902. The Board elected the highly respected former Fitzroy footballer and Australian test cricketer Jack Worrall , then the secretary of the Carlton Cricket Club , to the same position at the football club. As secretary, Worrall slowly took over the managing of the players, in what is now recognised as the first official coaching role in the VFL. Under Worrall's guidance in the latter part of the 1902 season, Carlton's on-field performances improved,  and in 1903 he led Carlton to the finals for the first time. Carlton built a strong reputation and financial position, and was able to convince many great players to shift to the club from other clubs, or even (in the case of Mick Grace ) out of retirement. Worrall led the club to its first three VFL premierships, won consecutively, in 1906 , 1907 and 1908 . Carlton became the first club in the VFL to win three premierships in a row, and its win-loss record of 19–1 in the 1908 season (including finals) was a record which stood for more than ninety years. N 1 , Following these premierships, Carlton went through a tumultuous period off-field. Some players had become frustrated by low payments and hard training standards, and responded by refusing to train or even play matches. The club removed Worrall from the coaching role (he retained the role of secretary), and after significant changes at board level after the 1909 season, Worrall left the club altogether. Many players who had supported Worrall left the club at the end of the season. Then, in 1910, several players were suspected of having taken bribes to fix matches, with two players ( Alex Lang and Doug Fraser ) both found guilty and suspended for 99 matches.  Despite this backdrop, Carlton continued its strong on-field form, reaching the 1909 and 1910 Grand Finals, but losing both.  , Carlton fell out of the finals in 1913, but returned in 1914 under coach Norm Clark , and with many inexperienced players, to win back-to-back premierships in 1914 and 1915 VFL seasons . Most football around the country was suspended during the height of World War I , but Carlton continued to compete in a VFL which featured, at its fewest, only four clubs. Altogether, between Jack Worrall's first Grand Final in 1904 and the peak of World War I in 1916, Carlton won five premierships and contested nine Grand Finals for one of the most successful times in the club's history. The only success which eluded the club was the Championship of Australia ; Carlton contested the championship three times (1907, 1908 and 1914), with its South Australian opponents victorious on all three occasions. , Through the 1920s and the Great Depression of the 1930s, Carlton maintained a strong on-field presence. The club was a frequent finalist, contesting fourteen finals series between the wars. However, premiership success did not follow, and the club contested only three Grand Finals for just one premiership during this period, and endured the longest premiership drought (23 years) in the club's history.  The drought was broken with the club's sixth VFL premiership in 1938 , when former Subiaco and South Melbourne champion Brighton Diggins was recruited by the club to serve as captain-coach. , On-field, Carlton's inter-war period was highlighted by two of its greatest goalkickers: in the 1920s, Horrie Clover (396 goals in 147 games), and in the 1930s, Harry "Soapy" Vallence (722 goals in 204 games), both of which were Carlton career records at the time. , The VFL continued to operate through World War II . With the retirement of Diggins, Carlton secured the services of former Richmond coach Percy Bentley , who coached the club for fifteen seasons. Carlton continued to finish in or near the finals without premiership success through the war, before winning the premiership in 1945, one month after peace. In a remarkable season, Carlton languished with a record of 3–6 after nine weeks, but won ten of the remaining eleven home-and-away matches to finish fourth; Carlton then comfortably beat North Melbourne in the first semi-final, overcame a 28-point deficit in the final quarter to beat Collingwood in the preliminary final, then beat South Melbourne in the notoriously brutal and violent Bloodbath Grand Final .  , Carlton contested two more Grand Finals in the 1940s, both against Essendon , winning the 1947 Grand Final by a single point, and being comfortably beaten in 1949 .  Thereafter followed what was Carlton's weakest on-field period since Worrall's appointment in 1902, with the club reaching the finals only four times between 1950 and 1964. Finishing tenth out of twelve and winning only five matches, 1964 was Carlton's worst VFL season to date.  , A change of president at the end of 1964 heralded the most successful period in the Carlton Football Club's history. Between 1967 and 1988, Carlton missed the finals only three times, contested ten Grand Finals, and won seven premierships.  , The period of success began when George Harris replaced Lew Holmes as president of the club, after the 1964 season. Harris then signed Melbourne legend Ron Barassi serve as coach from 1965. Barassi was a six-time premiership player and two-time premiership captain at Melbourne during its most successful era, and at the age of 28 was still one of the biggest names in the game. His shift to Carlton remains one of the biggest player transfers in the game's history.  Also contributing to Carlton's success was the strength of the Bendigo Football League , to which Carlton gained recruitment access through the VFL's country zoning arrangements. , Under Barassi, Carlton reached three consecutive Grand Finals between 1968 and 1970, resulting in two premierships: 1968 against Essendon and 1970 against traditional rivals Collingwood. The 1970 Grand Final remains one of the most famous matches in football history. Played in front of an enduring record crowd of 121,696, Collingwood dominated early to lead by 44 points at half time, but Carlton kicked seven goals in fifteen minutes after half time to narrow the margin to only three points; after a close final quarter, Carlton won its tenth VFL premiership with a ten-point victory. Carlton won its first and second Championship of Australia titles in 1968 and 1970, beating the SANFL 's Sturt Football Club in both seasons.  , Carlton missed the finals in 1971, and Barassi left the club at the end of the season, but Carlton returned to prominence the following year, and contested back-to-back Grand Finals. Both matches were against Richmond , with Carlton recording a high-scoring victory in 1972 , and losing a rough, physical encounter in 1973 .  , Of the legendary players from the Barassi era, none was more important than John Nicholls , who captained all three premierships and took over as captain-coach upon Barassi's departure. Nicholls, a ruckman and forward, had played at Carlton since 1957, and he and Graham Farmer (who played with Geelong and in the WAFL during the same era) are regarded as the greatest ruckmen in the league's history.  Midfielders Sergio Silvagni and Adrian Gallagher , half-forward Robert Walls , and ruckman Percy Jones were also prominent throughout the Barassi era, and in 1970, Alex Jesaulenko became the first (and to date, only) Carlton forward to kick 100 goals in a season. , Carlton continued to play finals through the 1970s without premiership success, and went through several coaches in a short period of time: Nicholls (until 1975), Ian Thorogood (1976–77), Ian Stewart (for only three matches in 1978), and Alex Jesaulenko as playing coach after Stewart's departure.  It was not until 1979 that Carlton again reached the Grand Final , defeating Collingwood by five points in a close match best remembered for the late goal kicked by Ken Sheldon , after Wayne Harmes tapped the ball into the goalsquare from the boundary line. , After the 1979 season, there was off-field instability at the board level. Ian Rice replaced George Harris as president, N 2 and many of Harris' supporters left the club, including Jesaulenko, who went to St Kilda . Percy Jones replaced Jesaulenko as coach in 1980, before Hawthorn coach David Parkin was recruited in 1981, Carlton's sixth coach in eight seasons.  , Despite the off-field troubles, Carlton continued to thrive on-field, and Parkin led the team to back-to-back premierships in 1981 and 1982 , with victories in the Grand Finals against Collingwood and Richmond respectively. With its fourteenth premiership in 1982, Carlton overtook Collingwood to become the most successful club in the league's history, based on premierships won – a position it has held either outright or jointly with Essendon since.  , Starring on-field during this period for Carlton was Bruce Doull , regarded as one of the best half-back flankers in the history of the league. Wayne Johnston was a prominent centreman/forward, and Carlton had great success recruiting high profile Western Australian footballers to the club, including Mike Fitzpatrick , Ken Hunter and Peter Bosustow . , In 1983, John Elliott took over the presidency from Ian Rice . On-field, the club endured three consecutive unsuccessful finals campaigns under Parkin before he was replaced by Robert Walls in 1986. Also in 1986, Carlton lured three of South Australia's top young players to the club: Stephen Kernahan , Craig Bradley and Peter Motley . The club reached the next two Grand Finals, losing in 1986 and winning in 1987 , both times against Hawthorn . Kernahan went on to become the club's longest serving captain and leading career goalkicker (738 goals), and Bradley became the club games record holder (375 games); Motley's career was unfortunately cut short by a non-fatal car accident in 1987. Carlton had also recruited Stephen Silvagni (son of Sergio ) in 1985, who is now recognised as one of the greatest fullbacks of all-time, and secured the league's star player Greg Williams in a trade in 1992. , David Parkin returned to coach the club from 1991 until 2000, and Carlton was a mainstay of the finals throughout most of this time. In 1995, Carlton became the first team to win twenty matches in a home-and-away season (finishing with a record of 20–2), and won the Grand Final against Geelong to claim its sixteenth premiership. Carlton reached two other Grand Finals during the 1990s, losing to Essendon in 1993 and to the Kangaroos in 1999 ; in 1999, Carlton had come from sixth on the home-and-away ladder to qualify for the Grand Final, famously beating its rival Essendon (the minor premiers ) by one point in the preliminary final .  , In 2002, Carlton swiftly fell from being one of the most successful clubs, both on-field and off-field, to one of the least successful. The club had been much slower than others to embrace the AFL Draft as a means for recruitment, so when its champion players from the 1990s began to retire in the early 2000s, on-field performances fell away quickly, and in 2002, the club won the wooden spoon for the first time in its VFL/AFL history. At the same time, the club was starting to struggle financially, due to unwise investments under John Elliott – most significantly, building a new grandstand at Princes Park during the 1990s, at a time when other clubs were finding it more profitable to play at the higher-capacity central venues.  Then, at the end of 2002, it was revealed that Carlton had been systematically cheating the league salary cap during the early 2000s. The scandal resulted in the loss of draft picks and a fine of almost one million dollars, which exacerbated the club's poor on-field and off-field positions. The club's professional reputation was also severely damaged.  , In the immediate fall-out from 2002, president John Elliott was removed, and was replaced with Docklands Stadium CEO Ian Collins . Under Collins, the club shifted its home stadium from Princes Park to Docklands, with the final match played at Princes Park in 2005. Additionally, coach Wayne Brittain was sacked, and replaced with Kangaroos coach Denis Pagan . On-field performances did not improve under Pagan, and overall the club won three wooden spoons and finished in the bottom two five times between 2002–2007.  , Carlton's overall position began to improve in 2007, when businessman Richard Pratt ,  Steven Icke  and Collingwood's Greg Swann  came to the club as president, general manager of football operations, and CEO respectively; although Pratt's presidency lasted only sixteen months, after which he was replaced by Stephen Kernahan ,  the new personnel stabilised the club's off-field position. Pagan was sacked as coach mid-season after a string of heavy defeats, and was replaced by former club captain Brett Ratten . Then, prior to the 2008 season, Carlton was able to secure a trade for West Coast 's Chris Judd , one of the league's best midfielders, to join the club as captain. The time spent at the bottom of the ladder also allowed Carlton to secure three No. 1 draft picks – Marc Murphy , Bryce Gibbs and Matthew Kreuzer – who helped the club's on-field position. Brett Ratten led Carlton to the finals from 2009 until 2011, but was sacked with a year remaining on his contact after the club missed the finals in 2012,  and was replaced by former West Coast and Collingwood premiership coach Mick Malthouse .  Under Malthouse, the club returned to the finals in 2013, but fell to thirteenth in 2014. Kernahan and Swann stepped aside in mid-2014, and were replaced by Mark LoGiudice as president and Steven Trigg as CEO. , The club's on-field performances deteriorated drastically in the early part of 2015, and after eight weeks it was bottom of the ladder. The relationship between Malthouse and the club's new board began to deteriorate publicly; and on 26 May, after giving a radio interview critical of the board, Malthouse was sacked.  , The current Carlton guernsey is plain navy blue, emblazoned with a white CFC monogram (which stands for "Carlton Football Club") on the front, and white numbers on the back. Other than changes to the font of the monogram, this has been Carlton's guernsey continually since 1909.  The club has worn navy blue in its uniform since 1871, when colour of the team's caps was changed from orange/yellow.  The club's on-and-off field apparel have been manufactured by Nike since 1998.   , The team wears navy-blue shorts in home games, and white shorts in away games. Since 2013, Carlton's clash guernsey has been predominantly white, with navy blue monogram, side-panels, shoulders, waist and numbers.  , Carlton's official nickname is the 'Blues'. Since the addition of navy blue to the playing uniform in 1871, the club has been known almost universally in print media as the Blues, Dark Blues or Navy Blues. Other colloquial nicknames include Bluebaggers or 'Baggers.  , Prior to 1871, when the uniform was predominantly chamois, the club was known informally as the Butchers. After World War II, the club briefly considered changing its nickname to the Cockatoos, but this never formally eventuated;  even so, the push was serious enough that newspaper cartoons depicting a Carlton cockatoo were printed around that time.  , Carlton's club song is We Are the Navy Blues . The song is sung to the tune of the chorus of " Lily of Laguna " by Leslie Stuart . , The club's traditional home ground is Princes Park (currently known as Ikon Park), located in North Carlton . After struggling to find a permanent home venue during its time in the VFA, Carlton established Princes Park as its home venue when it joined the VFL in 1897.  The club played most of its home matches at Princes Park every year between 1897–2004, and a single farewell game was staged at the venue in 2005. It was the last of the suburban home grounds N 3 to be used in AFL competition. , Since 2005, Carlton has split its home games between Docklands Stadium and the Melbourne Cricket Ground , with matches expecting to draw higher crowds usually played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. From 2005 until 2014, Docklands Stadium was the club's primary home ground and hosted the majority of Carlton's home games in those years, under a ten-year deal established during Ian Collins ' presidency. From 2015, the Melbourne Cricket Ground will become the club's primary home ground, and will host the majority of the club's home games.  , Four emergencies were also named: (1) Laurie Kerr , (2) Bob Chitty , (3) Horrie Clover and (4) Rod McGregor . The five players with an asterisk (*) are also members of the AFL Team of the Century – the largest number of any AFL club. , The Carlton Football Club established its Hall of Fame in 1987, with nine inaugural inductees. As of March 2013, there have been 73 inductees. , The club added a Legends category to the Hall of Fame in 1997. There are currently twelve Legends in the Hall of Fame: Craig Bradley , Bert Deacon , Bruce Doull , Alex Jesaulenko , Wayne Johnston , Stephen Kernahan , John Nicholls , Stephen Silvagni and Harry Vallence (all elevated in 1997); Ken Hands (2006); Robert Walls (2011);  and Geoff Southby (2013).  , Carlton's current coach is John Barker , who has served as caretaker since the sacking of Mick Malthouse 26 May 2015. Marc Murphy has captained the team since March 2013. , , Head coach , Assistant coaches , President – Mark Lo Giudice , Vice presidents – Richard Newton, Jeannie Pratt , Board members – Marcus Clarke, Zac Fried, Raphael Geminder, Adrian Gleeson , Mark Harrison, Greg Lee, Stephen Moulton, Ari Suss , CEOs since 1980. , 2002, 2005, 2006 , Known as "Robert Reynolds Trophy" until 2003 , VFL/AFL except where noted. Awarded the Coleman Medal since 1955. , Twenty-two people have been inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame for their services to football for careers which were either partially or entirely served with the Carlton Football Club. Of those, three have Legend status in the Hall of Fame. , Ron Barassi , Alex Jesaulenko , John Nicholls , Peter Bedford , Craig Bradley , Horrie Clover , George Coulthard , Bruce Doull , Ken Hands , Ern Henfry , Stephen Kernahan , Anthony Koutoufides , Rod McGregor , Peter McKenna , Stephen Silvagni , Geoff Southby , Harry Vallence , Robert Walls , Greg Williams . , David Parkin , Jack Worrall , Sir Kenneth Luke , Carlton operated its own reserves team from 1919 until 2002. From 1919 to 1991 the VFL/AFL operated a reserves competition , and from 1992 to 1999 a de facto AFL reserves competition was run by the Victorian State Football League . The Carlton Football Club fielded a reserves team in both of these competitions, allowing players who were not selected for the senior team to play for Carlton in the lower grade. During that time, the Carlton reserves team won eight premierships (1926, 1927, 1928, 1951, 1953, 1986, 1987, 1990). Following the demise of the AFL reserves competition, the Carlton reserves team competed in the new Victorian Football League for three seasons from 2000 until 2002. , The reserves team was dissolved at the end of 2002, and Carlton entered a reserves affiliation with existing VFL club, the Northern Bullants . Under the affiliation, reserves players for Carlton play VFL football with the Northern Bullants. The partnership between the two clubs was strengthened in 2012, when the Northern Bullants were renamed the Northern Blues and they adopted Carlton's navy blue colours. The club now splits its home games between the VFL club's traditional home, the Preston City Oval ; and Carlton's traditional home, Ikon Park.  The Essendon Football Club , nicknamed The Bombers or colloquially The Dons , is a professional Australian rules football club which plays in the Australian Football League (AFL). Essendon is one of the oldest clubs in the AFL.  Formed in 1871 as a junior club and playing as a senior club since 1878, it is historically associated with the suburb of Essendon in the north-west of Melbourne , Australia . Since 2013, the club has been headquartered at the True Value Solar Centre, Melbourne Airport , and plays its home games at either Docklands Stadium or the Melbourne Cricket Ground ; throughout most of its history the club's home ground and headquarters was Windy Hill , Essendon. , An original club of both the Victorian Football Association and the Victorian Football League (VFL), Essendon is one of Australia's best-known football clubs since the inception of a national Australian rules competition, the AFL, in 1990.  The club says to have over a million supporters Australia wide.  Essendon has won 16 VFL/AFL premierships which, along with Carlton , is the most of any club in the AFL. , , , The club was founded by members of the Royal Agricultural Society, the Melbourne Hunt Club and the Victorian Woolbrokers.  The Essendon Football Club was formed sometime between 1871 and 1873. It was held at a meeting at the home of a well-known brewery family, the McCrackens, whose Ascot Vale property hosted a team of local junior players.  , Robert McCracken, the owner of several city hotels, was the founder and first President of the Essendon club, and his son, Alex , its secretary. Alexander would later become president of the newly formed VFL. Alex’s cousin, Collier, who had already played with Melbourne , was the team’s first captain.  , The club began as a junior club, and its first official match was played against the Carlton second twenty on 7 June 1873,  with Essendon winning by one goal. Essendon played 13 matches in its first season, winning seven, with four draws and losing two. [ citation needed ] The club was one of the inaugural junior members of the Victorian Football Association (VFA) in 1877,  and began competing as a senior club from the 1878 season.  During its early years in the Association, Essendon played its home matches at Flemington Hill, but moved to the East Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1881. , In 1878, Essendon played in the first match on what would be considered by modern standards to be a full-sized field at Flemington Hill. In 1879 Essendon played Melbourne in one of the earliest night matches recorded when the ball was painted white. In 1883 the team played four matches in Adelaide. [ citation needed ] , In 1891 Essendon won their first VFA premiership, which they repeated in 1892, 1893 and 1894. One of the club's greatest players, Albert Thurgood played for the club during this period. [ citation needed ] Essendon was undefeated in the 1893 season. [ citation needed ] , At the end of the 1896 season Essendon along with seven other clubs formed the Victorian Football League . Essendon's first VFL game was in 1897 was against Geelong at Corio Oval in Geelong. Essendon won its first VFL premiership by winning the 1897 VFL finals series . Essendon again won the premiership in 1901 , defeating Collingwood in the Grand Final . The club won successive premierships in 1911 and 1912 over Collingwood and South Melbourne respectively. [ citation needed ] , Having already re-located from its ground at Kent Street, Ascot Vale ("McCracken's Paddock") to Flemington Hill, the club was again forced to move in 1881; and, because the City of Essendon mayor of the day considered the Essendon Cricket Ground "to be suitable only for the gentleman's game of cricket",  Essendon moved to East Melbourne. [ citation needed ] , The club became known by the nickname "the Same Old Essendon", from the title and hook of the principal song performed by a band of supporters which regularly occupied a section of the grandstand at the club's games.  The nickname first appeared in print in the local North Melbourne Advertiser in 1889,  and ended up gaining wide use, often as the diminutive "Same Olds". [ citation needed ] , This move away from Essendon, at a time when fans would walk to their local ground, didn't go down too well with many Essendon people; and, as a consequence, a new team and club was formed in 1900, unconnected with the first (although it played in the same colours), that was based at the Essendon Cricket Ground, and playing in the Victorian Football Association . It was known firstly as Essendon Town and, after 1905, as Essendon (although it was often called Essendon A, with the A standing for association).  , After the 1921 season, the East Melbourne Cricket Ground was closed and demolished to expand the Flinders Street Railyard . Having played at the East Melbourne Cricket Ground from 1882 to 1921, and having won four VFA premierships (1891–1894) and four VFL premierships ( 1897 , 1901 , 1911 and 1912 ) whilst there,  Essendon was looking for a new home, and was offered grounds at the current Royal Melbourne Showgrounds , at Victoria Park , at Arden St, North Melbourne , and the Essendon Cricket Ground. The Essendon City Council, offered the (VFL) team the Essendon Cricket Ground, announcing that it would be prepared to spend over ₤12,000 on improvements, including a new grandstand, scoreboard and re-fencing of the oval. , The club's first preference was to move to North Melbourne  – a move which the North Melbourne Football Club (then in the VFA) saw as a grand opportunity to get into the VFL. Most of Essendon's members and players were from the North Melbourne area, and sportswriters believed that Essendon would have been taken over by or rebranded as North Melbourne within only a few years of the move.   However, the VFA, desperate for its own strategic reasons not to lose its use of the North Melbourne Cricket Ground, successfully appealed to the State Government to block Essendon's move to North Melbourne.  With its preferred option off the table, the club returned to Essendon, and the Essendon VFA club disbanded, with most of its players moving to North Melbourne.  , The old "Same Olds" nickname fell into disuse, and by 1922 the other nicknames "Sash Wearers" and "Essendonians" that had been variously used from time to time were also abandoned. The team became universally known as "the Dons" (from Essen DON ); it was not until much later, during the War years of the early 1940s, that they became known as "The Bombers" — due to Windy Hill’s proximity to the Essendon Aerodrome .  , In the 1922 season , playing in Essendon for the first time in decades, Essendon reached the final four for the first time since 1912, finishing in third place. In the 1923 season the club topped the ladder with 13 wins from 16 games. After a 17 point second semi final loss to South Melbourne defeated Fitzroy (who had beaten South Melbourne) in the challenge final: Essendon 8.15 (63) to Fitzroy 6.10 (46). Amongst Essendon’s best players were half forward flanker George "Tich" Shorten , centre half forward Justin McCarthy , centre half back Tom Fitzmaurice , rover Frank Maher and wingman Jack Garden . , This was one of Essendon's most famous sides, dubbed the "Mosquito Fleet", due to the number of small, very fast players in the side. Six players were 5'6" (167 cm) or smaller. , The 1924 season proved to be arguably the strangest year in Essendon's entire history. For the first time since 1897 there was no ultimate match — either "Challenge Final" or "Grand Final" — to determine the premiers; instead, the top four clubs after the home and away season played a round-robin to determine the premiers. Essendon, having previously defeated both Fitzroy (by 40 points) and South Melbourne (by 33 points), clinched the premiership by means of a 20-point loss to Richmond. With the Tigers having already lost a match to Fitzroy by a substantial margin, the Dons were declared premiers by virtue of their superior percentage, meaning that Essendon again managed to win successive premierships. But the poor crowds for the finals meant this was never attempted again, resulting in Essendon having the unique record of winning the only two premierships without a grand final. [ citation needed ] , Prominent contributors to Essendon's 1924 Premiership success included back pocket Clyde Donaldson , follower Norm Beckton , half back flanker Roy Laing , follower Charlie May and rover Charlie Hardy . [ citation needed ] , The 1924 season was not without controversy, with rumours of numerous players accepting bribes. Regardless of the accuracy of these allegations, the club's image was tarnished, and the side experienced its lowest period during the decade that followed, with poor results on the field and decreased support off it. [ citation needed ] , There was worse to follow, with various Essendon players publicly blaming each other for the poor performance against Richmond, and then, with dissension still rife in the ranks, the side plummeted to an humiliating 28 point loss to VFA premiers Footscray in a special charity match played a week later in front of 46,100 people, in aid of Dame Nellie Melba's Limbless Soldiers' Appeal Fund , purportedly (but not officially) for the championship of Victoria.  , While it is always difficult to assess the damage caused by events such as these, the club's fortunes dipped alarmingly, and persistently. Indeed, after finishing third in the 1926 season , it was to be 14 years before Essendon would even contest a finals series. [ citation needed ] , The 1933 season , was probably the start of the Essendon revival, seeing the debut of the player regarded as one of Essendon's greatest players Dick Reynolds . His impact was immediate. He won his first Brownlow Medal aged 19. His record of three Brownlow victories (1934, 1937, 1938), equalled Haydn Bunton, Sr (1931, 1932, 1935), and later equalled by Bob Skilton (1959, 1963, 1968), and Ian Stewart (1965, 1966, 1971). , Reynolds went on to arguably even greater achievements as a coach, a position to which he was first appointed, jointly with Harry Hunter, in 1939 (this was while Reynolds was still a player). A year later he took the reins on a solo basis and was rewarded with immediate success (at least in terms of expectations at the time which, after so long in the wilderness, were somewhat modest). He was regarded as having a sound tactical knowledge of the game and being an inspirational leader, as he led the side into the finals in 1940 for the first time since 1926, when the side finished 3rd. Melbourne, which defeated Essendon by just 5 points in the preliminary final, later went on to trounce Richmond by 39 points in the grand final. , 1941 brought Essendon's first grand final appearance since 1923, but the side again lowered its colours to Melbourne. A year later war broke out and the competition was considerably weakened, with Geelong being forced to pull out of the competition due to travel restrictions as a result of petrol rationing. Attendances at games also declined dramatically, whilst some clubs had to move from their normal grounds due to them being used for military purposes. Many players were lost to football due to their military service. Nevertheless, Essendon went on to win the 1942 Premiership with Western Australian Wally Buttsworth in irrepressible form at centre half back. Finally, the long awaited premiership was Essendon's after comprehensively outclassing Richmond in the grand final, 19.18 (132) to 11.13 (79). The match was played at Carlton in front of 49,000 spectators. , In any case, there could be no such reservations about Essendon's next premiership, which came just four years later. Prior to that Essendon lost a hard fought grand final to Richmond in 1943 by 5 points, finished 3rd in 1944, and dropped to 8th in 1945. , After WWII, Esssendon enjoyed great success. In the five years immediately after the war, Essendon won 3 premierships (1946, 1949, 1950) and were runners up twice (1947, 1948). In 1946, Essendon were clearly the VFL's supreme force, topping the ladder after the roster games and surviving a drawn second semi final against Collingwood to win through to the grand final a week later with a 10.16 (76) to 8.9 (57). Then, in the grand final against Melbourne, Essendon set a grand final record score of 22.18 (150) to Melbourne 13.9 (87), with 7 goal centre half forward Gordon Lane . Rover Bill Hutchinson, and defenders Wally Buttsworth, Cec Ruddell and Harold Lambert among the best players. , The 1947 Grand Final has to go down in the ledger as 'one of the ones that got away', Essendon losing to Carlton by a single point despite managing 30 scoring shots to 21. As if to prove that lightning does occasionally strike twice, the second of the 'ones that got away' came just a year later, the Dons finishing with a lamentable 7.27, to tie with Melbourne (who managed 10.9) in the 1948 grand final. A week later Essendon waved the premiership good-bye, as Melbourne raced to a 13.11 (89) to 7.8 (50) triumph. The club's Annual Report made an assessment that was at once restrained and, as was soon to emerge, tacitly and uncannily prophetic: , It is very apparent that no team is complete without a spearhead and your committee has high hopes of rectifying that fault this coming season. , The 1949 season heralded the arrival on the VFL scene of John Coleman , arguably the greatest player in Essendon's history, and, in the view of some, the finest player the game has known. In his first ever appearance for the Dons, against Hawthorn in Round 1 1949, he booted 12 of his side's 18 goals to create an opening round record which was to endure for forty five years. More importantly, however, he went on to maintain the same high level of performance throughout the season, kicking precisely 100 goals for the year to become the first player to top the ton since Richmond's Jack Titus in 1940. [ citation needed ] , The Coleman factor was just what Essendon needed to enable them to take that vital final step to premiership glory, but even so it was not until the business end of the season that this became clear. Essendon struggled to make the finals in 4th place, but once there they suddenly ignited to put in one of the most consistently devastating September performances in VFL history. , Collingwood succumbed first as the Dons powered their way to an 82 point first semi final victory, and a fortnight later it was the turn of the North Melbourne Football Club as Essendon won the preliminary final a good deal more comfortably than the ultimate margin of 17 points suggested. In the grand final, Essendon were pitted against Carlton and in a match that was a total travesty as a contest they overwhelmed the Blues to the tune of 73 points, 18.17 (125) to 6.16 (52). Best for the Dons included pacy aboriginal half back flanker Norm McDonald, ruckman Bob McLure, and rovers Bill Hutchinson and Ron McEwin. John Coleman also did well, registering 6 majors. , A year later Essendon were if anything even more dominant, defeating the North Melbourne Football Club in both the second semi final and the grand final to secure consecutive VFL premierships for the third time. Best afield in the grand final in what was officially his swansong as a player was captain-coach Dick Reynolds, who received sterling support from the likes of Norm McDonald, ruckman/back pocket Wally May, back pocket Les Gardiner, and big Bob McLure. , With 'King Richard' still holding court as coach in 1951, albeit now in a non-playing capacity, Essendon seemed on course for a third consecutive flag but a controversial four-week suspension dished out to John Coleman on the eve of the finals effectively put paid to their chances. Coleman was reported for retaliation after twice being struck by his Carlton opponent, Harry Caspar, and without him the Dons were rated a 4 goals poorer team. Nevertheless, they still managed to battle their way to a 6th successive grand final with wins over Footscray by 8 points in the first semi final and Collingwood by 2 points in the preliminary final. , The Dons sustained numerous injuries in the preliminary final and the selectors sprang a surprise on grand final day by naming the officially retired Dick Reynolds as 20th man. 'King Richard' was powerless to prevent the inevitable, although leading at half time, the Geelong kicked five goals to two points in the third quarter to set up victory by 11 points. , Essendon slumped to 8th in 1952 but John Coleman was in irrepressible form managing 103 goals for the year. Hugh Buggy noted in The Argus : "It was the wettest season for twenty two years and Coleman showed that since the war he was without peer in the art of goal kicking." , Two seasons later Coleman's career was ended after he dislocated a knee during the Round 8 clash with the North Melbourne Football Club at Essendon. Aged just twenty five, he had kicked 537 goals in only 98 VFL games in what was generally a fairly low scoring period for the game. His meteoric rise and fall were clearly the stuff of legend, and few if any players, either before or since, have had such an immense impact over so brief a period. , According to Alf Brown, football writer for The Herald : , (Coleman) had all football's gifts. He was courageous, a long, straight kick, he had a shrewd football brain and, above all, he was a spectacular, thrilling mark. , Somewhat more colourful, R.S. Whittington suggested, , "Had he been a trapeze artist in a strolling circus, Coleman could have dispensed with the trapeze." , Without Coleman, Essendon's fortunes plummeted, and there were to be no further premierships in the 1950s. The nearest miss came in 1957 when the Bombers (as they were popularly known by this time) earned premiership favouritism after a superb 16 point second semi final defeat of Melbourne, only to lose by over 10 goals against the same side a fortnight later. , 1959 saw another grand final loss to Melbourne, this time by 37 points, but the fact that the average age of the Essendon side was only 22 was seen as providing considerable cause for optimism. However, it was to take another three years, and a change of coach, before the team's obvious potential was translated into tangible success. [ citation needed ] , John Coleman started his coaching career at Essendon in 1961, thus ending the Dick Reynolds era at the club. In the same year Essendon finished the season mid table and supporters were not expecting too much for the following season. However, the club blitzed the opposition in this year, losing only two matches and finishing top of the table. Both losses were to the previous year's grand finalists. The finals posed no problems for the resurgent Dons, easily accounting for Carlton in the season's climax, winning the 1962 Premiership. This was a remarkable result for Coleman who in his second season of coaching pulled off the ultimate prize in Australian football. As so often is the case after a flag, the following two years were below standard. A further premiership in 1965 (won from 4th position on the ladder), was also unexpected due to periods of poor form during the season. The Bombers were a different club when the finals came around, but some of the credit for the improvement was given to the influence of Brian Sampson and Ted Fordham during the finals. Coleman's time as coach turned out to be much like his playing career: highly successful but cut short when he had to stand down due to health problems in 1967. Only six years later, on the eve of the 1973 season, he would be dead of a heart-attack at just 44 years of age. , Following Coleman's retirement, the club experienced tough times on and off the field. Finals appearances were rare for the side, which was often in contention for the wooden spoon . Essendon did manage to make the 1968 VFL Grand Final , but lost to Carlton by just three points and would not make it back to the big stage for a decade-and-a-half. , During the period from 1968 until 1980, five different coaches were tried, with none lasting longer than four years. Off the field the club went through troubled times as well. In 1970 five players went on strike before the season even began, demanding higher payments. Essendon did make the finals in 1972 and 1973 under the autocratic direction of Des Tuddenham (Collingwood) but they were beaten badly in successive elimination finals by St. Kilda and would not taste finals action again until the very end of the decade. The 70s Essendon sides were involved in many rough and tough encounters under Tuddenham, who himself came to logger heads with Ron Barassi at a quarter time huddle where both coaches exchanged heated words. Essendon had tough, but talented players with the likes of "Rotten Ronnie" Ron Andrews and experienced players such as Barry Davis , Ken Fletcher , Geoff Blethyn , Neville Fields and West Australian import Graham Moss . In May 1974, a controversial half time all-in-brawl with Richmond at Windy Hill and a 1975 encounter with Carlton were testimony of the era. Following the Carlton match, the 'Herald' described Windy Hill as "Boot Hill", because of the extent of the fights and the high number of reported players (eight in all – four from Carlton and four from Essendon). The peak of these incidents would occur in 1980 with new recruit Phil Carman making headlines for head-butting an umpire. The tribunal suspended him for sixteen weeks, and although most people thought this was a fair (or even lenient) sentence, he took his case to the supreme court, gathering even more unwanted publicity for the club. Despite this, the club had recruited many talented young players in the late 70s who would emerge as club greats. Three of those young players were Simon Madden , Tim Watson and Paul Van Der Haar . Terry Daniher and his brother Neale would come via a trade with South Melbourne , and Roger Merrett joined soon afterwards to form the nucleus of what would become the formidable Essendon sides of the 1980s. This raw but talented group of youngsters took Essendon to an elimination final in 1979 under Barry Davis but were again thrashed in an Elimination Final, this time at the hands of Fitzroy. Davis resigned at the end of the 1980 season after missing out on a finals appearance. , One of the few highlights for Essendon supporters during this time was when Graham Moss won the 1976 Brownlow Medal ; he was the only Bomber to do so in a 40-year span from 1953–1993. Even that was bittersweet as he quit VFL football to move back to his native Western Australia, where Moss finished out his career as a player and coach at Claremont Football Club . In many ways, Moss' career reflects Essendon's mixed fortunes during the decade. , Former Richmond player Kevin Sheedy started as head coach in 1981.  , Essendon reached the Grand Final in 1983, the first time since 1968. Hawthorn won by a then record 83 points.  , In 1984, Essendon won the pre-season competition and completed the regular season on top of the ladder. The club played, and beat, Hawthorn in the 1984 VFL Grand Final to win their 13th premiership—their first since 1965. The teams met again in the 1985 Grand Final , which Essendon also won. At the start of 1986 , Essendon were considered unbackable for three successive flags, but a succession of injuries to key players Paul Van der Haar (only fifteen games from 1986 to 1988), Tim Watson , Darren Williams , Roger Merrett and Simon Madden led the club to win only eight of its last eighteen games in 1986 and only nine games (plus a draw with Geelong ) in 1987.  During this period, the Bombers suffered a humiliation at the hands of Sydney who became the only team ever to kick two hundred points in three quarters.  , In 1988, Essendon made a rebound to sixth place with twelve wins, including a 140-point thrashing of Brisbane where they had a record sixteen individual goalkickers.  In 1989, they rebounded further to second on the ladder with only five losses and thrashed Geelong in the Qualifying Final. However, after a fiery encounter with Hawthorn ended in a convincing defeat, the Bombers were no match for Geelong next week. , In 1990, Essendon were pace-setters almost from the start, but a disruption from the Qualifying Final draw between Collingwood and West Coast was a blow from which they never recovered. The Magpies comprehensively thrashed them in both the second semi final and the grand final. , Following the 1991 season, Essendon moved its home games from its traditional home ground at Windy Hill to the larger and newly renovated MCG . This move generated large increases in game attendance, membership and revenue for the club. The club's training and administrative base remained at Windy Hill until 2013. , Following the retirement of Tim Watson and Simon Madden in the early 1990s, the team was built on new players such as Gavin Wanganeen , Joe Misiti , Mark Mercuri , Michael Long , Dustin Fletcher (son of Ken) and James Hird , who was taken at #79 in the 1992 draft. This side became known as the "Baby Bombers", as the core of the side was made up of young players early in their careers. , The team won the 1993 Grand Final against Carlton and that same year, Gavin Wanganeen won the Brownlow Medal , the first awarded to an Essendon player since 1976. Three years later, James Hird was jointly awarded the medal with Michael Voss of Brisbane. , In 2000, Essendon won 20 consecutive matches before they lost to the Western Bulldogs in round 21. The team went on to win their 16th premiership, defeating Melbourne , thereby completing the most dominant single season in AFL/VFL history. The defeat to the Bulldogs was the only defeat for Essendon throughout the entire calendar year (Essendon also won the 2000 pre-season competition).  , Essendon was less successful after 2001. Lucrative contracts to a number of premiership players had caused serious pressure on the club's salary cap, forcing the club to trade several key players. [ citation needed ] Blake Caracella, Chris Heffernan, Justin Blumfield, Gary Moorcroft and Damien Hardwick had all departed by the end of 2002; in 2004 Mark Mercuri , Sean Wellman and Joe Misiti retired. The club remained competitive, however they could progress no further than the second week of the finals each year for the years of 2002, 2003, and 2004. Sheedy signed a new three-year contract at the end of 2004. , In 2005 , Essendon missed the finals for the first time since 1997; and in 2006 , the club suffered its worst season under Sheedy, and its worst for more than 70 years, finishing second-last with only three wins (one of which was against defending premiers Sydney , in which Matthew Lloyd kicked eight goals)  and one draw from twenty-two games. Matthew Lloyd replaced James Hird as captain at the start of the season, but after suffering a season-ending hamstring injury early in the season, David Hille was appointed captain for the remainder of the season. The club improved its on-field position in 2007, but again missed the finals. , Sheedy's contract was not renewed after 2007, ending his 27-year tenure as Essendon coach. Matthew Knights replaced Sheedy as coach, and coached the club for three seasons, reaching the finals once – an eighth place finish in 2009 at the expense of reigning premiers Hawthorn .  On 29 August 2010, shortly after the end of the 2010 home-and-away season, Knights was dismissed as coach. , On 28 September 2010, former captain James Hird was named as Essendon's new coach from 2011 on a four-year deal. Former Geelong dual premiership winning coach and Essendon triple-premiership winning player Mark Thompson later joined Hird on the coaching panel. In his first season, Essendon finished eighth. The club started strongly in 2012, sitting fourth with a 10-3 record at the halfway mark of the season; but the club won only one more match for the season, finishing eleventh to miss the finals. , During 2013, the club was investigated by the AFL and the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA) over its 2012 player supplements and sports science program , most specifically over allegations into illegal use of peptide supplements. An internal review found it to have "established a supplements program that was experimental, inappropriate and inadequately vetted and controlled", and on 27 August 2013 the club was found guilty of bringing the game into disrepute for this reason. Among its penalties, the club was fined A$2 million, stripped of early draft picks in the following two drafts, and forfeited its place in the 2013 finals series (having originally finished seventh on the ladder); Hird was suspended from coaching for twelve months.  Several office-bearers also resigned their posts during the controversy, including chairman David Evans  and CEO Ian Robson.  However, on 31 March, 2015, the AFL anti-doping tribunal ruled they were "not comfortably satisfied" that the 34 past and present Essendon players had used any banned substance in relation to the club's 2012 supplements program.  , On May 12, 2015 The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) announced an appeal, with the case to be determined at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. , In October 2013, the club moved its training and administrative base to the True Value Solar Centre, a new facility in the suburb of Melbourne Airport which it had developed in conjunction with the Australian Paralympic Committee . Essendon holds a 37-year lease at the facility,  and maintains a lease at Windy Hill to use the venue for home matches for its reserves team in the Victorian Football League , and for a social club and merchandise store on the site.  , Assistant coach Mark Thompson took over as coach for the 2014 season during Hird's suspension,  and he led the club back to the finals for a seventh-place finish. Hird has returned to the position of senior coach for the 2015 and 2016 seasons.  , Essendon's first recorded jumpers were navy blue (The Footballers, edited by Thomas Power, 1875) although the club wore 'red and black caps and hose'. In 1877 The Footballers records the addition of 'a red sash over left shoulder'. This is the first time a red sash as part of the club jumper and by 1878 there are newspaper reports referring to Essendon players as 'the men in the sash'. , Given that blue and navy blue were the most popular colours at the time it is thought that Essendon adopted a red sash in 1877 to distinguish its players from others in similar coloured jumpers. , In 2007, the AFL Commission laid down the requirement that all clubs must produce an alternative jumper for use in matches where jumpers are considered to clash. Since 2012, Essendon's clash guernsey has been predominantly grey, with a red sash fimbriated in black; the grey field contains, in small print, the names of all Essendon premiership players.  , From 2007–2011, the Essendon clash guernsey was the same design as its home guernsey, but with a substantially wider sash such that the guernsey was predominantly red rather than predominantly black. This was changed after 2011 when the AFL deemed that the wider sash did not provide a sufficient contrast.  , Following Adam Ramanauskas ' personal battle with cancer, a "Clash for Cancer" match against Melbourne was launched in 2006. This was a joint venture between Essendon and the Cancer Council of Victoria to raise funds for the organisation.  Despite a formal request to the AFL being denied, players wore yellow armbands for the match which resulted in the club being fined $20,000.  In 2007, the AFL agreed to allow yellow armbands to be incorporated into the left sleeve of the jumper.  The 'Clash for Cancer' match against Melbourne has become an annual event, repeated in 2008 and 2009. In 2009, the jumpers were auctioned along with yellow boots worn by some players during the match.  , The club's theme song, "See the Bombers Fly Up", was written c. 1959 by Kevin Andrews and is based on the tune of Johnnie Hamp 's 1929 song " (Keep Your) Sunny Side Up " at an increased tempo. At the time, "(Keep Your) Sunny Side Up" was the theme song for the popular Melbourne-based TV show Sunnyside Up .  The official version of the song was recorded in 1972 by the Fable Singers and is still used today.  , The song, as with all other AFL clubs, is played prior to every match and at the conclusion of matches when the team is victorious. , Songwriter Mike Brady , of " Up There Cazaly " fame, penned an updated version of the song in 1999 complete with a new verse arrangement, but it was not well received. However, this version is occasionally played at club functions. , The club's mascot is named Skeeta Reynolds, named after Dick Reynolds. He is a mosquito, created in honour of the team's back-to-back Premierships side in the 1920s known as the Mosquito Fleet. He was first named through a competition run in the Bomber magazine - "Skeeta" being the winning entry. This was later changed by the AFL to Skeeta Reynolds. He appears as a red mosquito in an Essendon jumper and wears a red and black scarf. , Notable supporters include Andrew Bogut , Australian basketball player,  and Dante Exum , Australian basketball player.  Steve Irwin was also a supporter.  , Essendon has a four-way rivalry with Carlton , Collingwood and Richmond , being the four biggest and most supported clubs in Victoria. Matches between the clubs are often close regardless of form and ladder positions. If out of the race themselves, all four have the desire to deny the others a finals spot or a premiership. Essendon also has a fierce rivalry with Hawthorn stemming from the 1980s. , The current Chairman is former Toll Holdings managing director Paul Little after David Evans made the decision to leave due to health concerns. David Evans was appointed at the club's Annual General Meeting on 21 December 2009.  He succeeds Ray Horsburgh (Chairman since 2006) who will remain as a board member for the remainder of his term. David is the son of former club chairman Ron Evans (1988–1992). , On 25 August 2008, Samsung was announced as major sponsor of the Essendon Football Club in a three-year deal touted as the biggest individual annual club sponsorship in AFL history .  The deal included Samsung having naming rights on the front and back of the club jumper and signage. Although the amount was only confirmed by the club as a very significant lift from where 3 were , it was estimated to be worth around $7 million in total.  , The club's apparel is currently produced by Adidas .  , See Essendon Football Club honours See W.

The team enjoyed success in the form of eight premierships between 1919 and 1999, including the last Victorian State Football League year in 1999. From 2000 until 2002, the club's reserves team competed in the new Victorian Football League competition. , At the end of 2002, the club dissolved its reserves team, and established a reserves affiliation with the Bendigo Football Club in the VFL. The affiliation ran for ten years from 2003 until 2012, allowing reserves players from the Essendon list to play with Bendigo. , The club re-established its reserves team in 2013, seeking greater developmental autonomy, and the reserves team has since competed in the VFL. The team plays its home games at Windy Hill .  The team is made up of AFL senior listed players and VFL contracted players. , a Essendon refused to play the Grand Final in Geelong, so the premiership was awarded to Geelong.  The Geelong Football Club , nicknamed The Cats , is a professional Australian rules football club, named after and based in the city of Geelong , playing in the Australian Football League (AFL). The club has been the VFL/AFL premiers nine times, with three in the AFL era (since 1990). Geelong has also won nine McClelland Trophies , a record it shares with Essendon .   , Formed in 1859, Geelong is the second oldest club in the AFL after Melbourne and one of the oldest football clubs in the world.  The club participated in the first football competition in Australia, winning the second season in 1863, and was a foundation club of the Victorian Football Association (VFA) in 1877 and the Victorian Football League (VFL) in 1897.  , An early VFL powerhouse with six premierships up to 1963, Geelong developed a reputation as an under-achieving club. Despite playing in five losing Grand Finals , four between 1989 and 1995, its fans waited 44 years until it won another premiership—an AFL-record 119-point victory in the 2007 AFL Grand Final .    Despite recording the most successful home and away season in the game's history, the club went one win short of back-to-back premierships in losing the 2008 AFL Grand Final to Hawthorn, but won the 2009 Grand Final against St Kilda. This was followed up with another Grand Final victory, in 2011 against Collingwood . With three premierships since the commencement of the AFL in 1990 they are the second most successful side behind Hawthorn who have won four premierships. , The club's home ground is Kardinia Park (currently also known by its sponsorship name "Simonds Stadium"). However, the club also hosts home matches at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and Docklands Stadium . The club's traditional guernsey colours are white with navy blue hoops, white shorts and navy and white hooped socks and the team song is "We Are Geelong". The club's nickname, the "Cats", was first used in 1923 after a run of losses prompted a local cartoonist to suggest that the club needed a black cat to bring it good luck. , , , The Geelong Football Club was formally established at a meeting held in the Victoria Hotel on 18 July 1859.  The club is one of the oldest football clubs in the world; however, many of its official records before 1920 have disappeared.  , Geelong travelled to Melbourne to become the second winner of the Caledonian Challenge Cup in 1863, played under compromise rules. Geelong's George Reynolds Rippon kicked the winning goal to defeat Melbourne to take the cup. The club contested the final in 1867 and 1869. , Tom Wills , one of the founders of Australian football, played exclusively for Geelong from 1865 until his retirement from football in 1874. As Geelong's captain, he pioneered the Australian football tactic of flooding .  , Geelong played most of its early home games at the Argyle Square, situated between Aberdeen Street and Pakington Street. However, in 1881 the club was evicted from the ground by the private owner who ploughed up the paddock because the club had neglected to pay its rent.  , Geelong moved to Corio Oval for the 1878 season – the year the club won its first VFA premiership in only the second VFA season.  , The Geelong Football Club was among the most powerful in the VFA ( Victorian Football Association ), winning seven VFA premierships up to the birth of the VFL ( Victorian Football League ) in 1897.  Geelong was the only non-Melbourne-based team at a time when a trip from Geelong to Melbourne involved quite an arduous journey. Notable was Geelong's success in "The Match of the Century" in 1886. This first grand final in the VFA between two previously undefeated teams, Geelong and South Melbourne, stimulated unprecedented public interest. It was alleged that saboteurs attempted to destroy one of the special trains carrying Geelong supporters to the match in South Melbourne. The victorious Geelong team were treated to an impromptu public parade in the enemy territory of South Melbourne. , Geelong helped form the new VFL with other foundation clubs, Carlton, Collingwood, Essendon, Fitzroy, Melbourne, South Melbourne and St Kilda. , For many years the Geelong Football Club were known as the Pivotonians , after the city's nickname 'The Pivot'. Seagulls was also an earlier nickname. The dark blue and white hooped uniform still worn today represents the blue water of Corio Bay and the white seagulls so numerous in the Bay. Geelong was nicknamed the 'Cats' in 1923 after a run of losses prompted a local cartoonist to suggest that the club needed a black cat to bring it good luck. Soon after, during a match a black cat ventured on to the ground. Geelong won that match, breaking the losing streak. Geelong has ever since been known as the Cats. , Despite dominating in the VFA, Geelong found the premiership harder to win in the VFL. In 1897, the inaugural season of the VFL, no grand final was played, but instead a round-robin finals system. Essendon won all three of its games, while Geelong lost to Essendon during this series. As a result, Geelong finished second in the inaugural season, a good start to the new league. , Geelong performed poorly early on in the 1923 season . In the lead-up to the club's Round 9 clash against favourites Carlton, the Herald Sun published a depiction of the match by cartoonist Sam Wells, featuring a black cat wandering onto the field to give Geelong good luck. Credit was given to the cat when Geelong recorded an upset win. Geelong captain Bert Rankin liked the analogy and suggested the club adopt "the Cats" nickname, even recruiting key position forward Lloyd Hagger , a talented artist, to design a cat that was made into badges for the players to wear on their lapels.   , Geelong finally won its first VFL premiership in 1925.  , The VFL/AFL's award for the fairest and best player in a season is named after Charles Brownlow , a Geelong and VFL administrator who died in early 1924. The first player to win the award was Geelong's champion, Edward Greeves , in 1924. Greeves attained a second and third place in votes for the award in later seasons, emphasizing his skill and sportsmanship. , Geelong followed up on its 1925 Premiership with wins in 1931 and 1937.  The 1937 Grand Final is widely regarded as a game of the highest quality, remembered for its long and accurate kicking and high marking. During this era the Coulter Law discouraged club administrators from poaching players from each other's clubs. For many footballers who were seldom more than semi-professional sportsmen, match payments supplemented Great Depression -hit wages. , In 1941, the club moved from Corio Oval to the more centrally located Kardinia Park in South Geelong . Geelong experienced a lean period in the 1940s. World War II wartime restrictions prohibited travel in 1942 and 1943 even for the purposes of playing football. Geelong had always been particularly subject to what Geoffrey Blainey , a notable Australian historian, author of A Game of Our Own , and Geelong supporter, termed the "tyranny of distance". Despite these handicaps, at war's end the club recruited many players who represented the club during its most successful era in the early 1950s. , In the 1950s, Geelong flourished. Led by Geelong's greatest coach (officially named at Geelong's Team of the Century 2000) Reg Hickey , Geelong won two consecutive premiership flags of 1951 and 1952.  In 1951 the Ford Motor Company signed on as a corporate sponsor of the Geelong Football Club.   This relationship has persisted to the present day. , Geelong won the 1951 Premiership under memorable circumstances. Essendon was favoured to win the third of a hat-trick of premierships. However, in the final round of the home and away season Essendon's champion full forward, John Coleman retaliated against Carlton full back, Harry Caspar and was reported and later suspended for four weeks. He therefore was unable to play in the grand final. Bob Davis acknowledges the possibility that had Coleman played, Essendon may well have won, given that Geelong had no true match for him, as Coleman was simply too skilled. , To celebrate its good fortune, Geelong buried a toy bomber in the Kardinia Park turf. This comical ceremony was inspired by the rumour that Geelong's premiership players of 1937 had buried a magpie in the middle of the ground after their premiership win over Collingwood that year. Players of note in this golden era include Bob Davis, Leo Turner (father of future star, Michael Turner ), Peter Pianto , Fred Flanagan , and Bernie Smith . Bernie Smith's quality was recognised with his win in the 1951 Brownlow Medal . In 1952, Geelong easily defeated Lou Richards ' Collingwood team. To celebrate the win, the next day the players buried another dead magpie in the middle of Kardinia Park. In 1953, Collingwood defeated Geelong in the Grand Final. , In 1956, Geelong recruited Billy Goggin , Geelong's greatest rover, who also coached Geelong in the 1980s. , At the end of 1959, Reg Hickey decided to retire as coach, making way for Bob Davis , a star in the 51–52 Premierships. , Geelong's most notable recruitment coup ever was the transfer of perhaps the greatest ruckman of all time, Graham "Polly" Farmer from East Perth. At Geelong's first practice match, a crowd of 20,000 attended just to witness his legendary skills. , In 1962, another of Geelong's star players, Alistair Lord won the Brownlow Medal playing in the centre. His twin, Stewart Lord also played with the club and has been credited as the main reason his brother won the award given their similarities in appearance, both played significant roles in the club's premiership win. High expectations of success were somewhat disappointed in 1962. Graham Farmer injured his knee three times during the season, causing him to miss crucial games. However, as Farmer's and Goggin's partnership developed from 1963 onwards, their teamwork at ruck duels inspired admiration and envy. These two players spearheaded the club's next premiership in 1963.  , In 1963, Geelong played Hawthorn four times. Early in the season the clubs played a draw. However, in the final round of the season, the semi finals and the grand final (the only instance of a team playing three matches in a row against one other team – Hawthorn does not have that claim as it played Melbourne in the intervening Preliminary Final), Geelong defeated John Kennedy's Hawthorn (the Hawks). Captained by Fred Wooller , Geelong clearly distinguished itself as the team of 1963 with an easy 49 point win. A dead hawk joined two magpies and a toy bomber under the Kardinia Park turf.  , Frustratingly for supporters of the Club, 1963 was the last time that Geelong enjoyed premiership success until 2007. , At the beginning of 1964, Geelong recruited John "Sammy" Newman as a ruckman from Geelong Grammar School . In an interview with Lou Richards on Channel 7's World of Sport , Bob Davis predicted that Newman would enjoy a stellar career. Sam Newman played 300 games for Geelong and went on to become a prominent, if controversial, media personality. , Geelong played in finals in every year between 1962 and 1969. Graham Farmer succeeded Fred Wooller as captain in 1965, leading the club until the end of 1967. In 1966, the Geelong Board decided to declare the coaching position open. Applications were sought but Bob Davis declined to reapply. The Board chose Peter Pianto as Davis' replacement. Pianto coached Geelong to the 1967 Grand Final. Geelong narrowly lost this match by nine points to Richmond. Graham Farmer played his 101st and final match for Geelong on this day. , The 1970s Geelong Football Club achieved mediocre results. The club fell behind the progressive clubs of the 1970s, notably Carlton , Richmond , Hawthorn and North Melbourne . Unlike these clubs, Geelong recruited poorly and/or could not afford to recruit quality footballers. During the 1970s footballers increasingly came to view the game as a profession rather than a pastime. Richer and more entrepreneurial clubs outbidded clubs like Geelong for talented and dedicated players.  Coaches Graham Farmer and Rodney Olsson failed to develop successful teams. Geelong finished fourth in the 1976 season. The club won its only final of the 1970s by defeating fifth-placed Footscray. Geelong lost to North Melbourne in the second week of the finals. In 1978 Geelong finished fifth, only to lose to Carlton in the first week of the finals. One of the few noteworthy players was Larry Donohue , who in 1976 kicked over 100 goals to lead the VFL goal kicking. 1978 yielded him 95 goals. , During the 1980s Geelong recruited well but underperformed on the field. , In 1980, coached by Billy Goggin , Geelong finished on top of the ladder at the home and away season. Geelong defeated Richmond once during the season but could not do it again in the first week of the finals. Geelong played Collingwood in the Preliminary Final for the right to play Richmond in the Grand Final and lost the match. , In 1981 Geelong's finals campaign inflicted more heartbreak. Geelong beat Collingwood in the Qualifying Final but lost to Carlton in the Second Semi-Final. Geelong were beaten by Collingwood by the narrow margin of seven points when they clashed again in the Preliminary Final. , In 1982 the club collapsed on-field, missing the finals. The board sacked Billy Goggin. Richmond premiership coach Tom Hafey took over in 1983. However, the club did not improve under Hafey. Geelong failed to play in the finals during Hafey's tenure. One bright moment during the Hafey years was the recruitment of former Hawthorn player Gary Ablett from Myrtleford for the 1984 season. In his first season, Ablett won his only Best and Fairest for the club, an early indication of Ablett's football genius. , The most notable incident for the club in 1985 was when Hawthorn legend Leigh Matthews swung his arm at ruck-rover Neville Bruns ' jaw and broke it. The incident received huge media coverage. Matthews was charged by police. Although the law courts did not punish Matthews, the VFL suspended his playing permit for one month. , The club also recruited future champion midfielder and dual Brownlow Medallist, Greg Williams and another future Brownlow Medallist and three-time club champion, Paul Couch . Due to a lack of on-field improvement during his tenure as coach, Tom Hafey was sacked at the end of the 1985 season. Hafey was soon afterwards appointed coach of the Sydney Swans . Three players followed him to Sydney: David Bolton , Bernard Toohey , and Greg Williams . , In 1986, John Devine , a member of the 1963 Premiership team, was appointed as coach. Under Devine, the club recruited Barry Stoneham , Garry Hocking , Mark Bairstow and Billy Brownless . Geelong's recruiters demonstrated that they had adapted to the new system of the player salary cap introduced in 1985 and the AFL Draft introduced in 1986. [ citation needed ] However, the club missed the finals during Devine's tenure. In 1986, as a sign of things to come, Paul Couch won the first of his three club best-and-fairest awards. In 1987 Geelong missed the finals. , In the pre-season of 1988, in a foretaste of approaching frustrations, Geelong contested with Hawthorn for the pre-season cup, the National-Panasonic Cup . Geelong lost by two points despite being in control for much of the match. Geelong underperformed in the main competition, finishing tenth. The board sacked John Devine as coach. , In 1989 Geelong signed North Melbourne champion Malcolm Blight to coach the club. Blight's new approach had mixed results. Geelong once again contested the National-Panasonic pre-season grand final, this time against Melbourne. Once again the Cats lost. , Adapting quickly to Blight's coaching philosophy, Geelong kicked high scores. During the 1989 season, Geelong were the only club to win by 100 points for three weeks in a row, defeating lowly clubs Richmond, St Kilda and the Brisbane Bears . Gavin Exell had a productive season, kicking 61 goals during the home-and-away season, narrowly pipping team-mate Gary Ablett , who kicked 60. , Ablett's notable goalkicking feats of the year included 14 goals against Richmond, 10 against Brisbane and seven against Collingwood (where he gained 38 possessions on the wing in the wet). [ citation needed ] In this match against Collingwood, Gary Ablett also kicked the Goal of the Year . , Geelong finished third at the completion of the home-and-away season and met Essendon in the qualifying finals in the first week. Geelong's lack of finals experience was telling as Essendon ended a three-year losing streak to Geelong, thrashing them by 76 points. Gary Ablett and Shane Hamilton each kicked three goals. , Geelong then met Melbourne in the semifinals. The previous week, Essendon had assigned "taggers" to Geelong's midfielders, Paul Couch and Mark Bairstow . This move worked to great effect, nullifying both. Melbourne coach John Northey did the same. However, his move was considered so predictable by Malcolm Blight that he benched both Couch and Bairstow for the first quarter, throwing Melbourne's plans into disarray. The result saw Geelong easily defeat Melbourne by over 10 goals. Gary Ablett kicked seven goals as well as taking one of the marks of the year over Melbourne's Steven Febey . , The preliminary finals saw a rematch between Geelong and Essendon at VFL Park . Early on, it appeared that Essendon would repeat their win of two weeks prior. However, Geelong soon got back on track and began to kick goals. Gary Ablett continued his good form, kicking eight goals and constructing many more. The result saw Geelong cause a 170-point turnaround from a fortnight before, to comprehensively defeat Essendon by 94 points, to go into the club's first grand final since 1967. , The 1989 VFL Grand Final proved to be an epic battle. At the opening bounce, Mark Yeates , retaliating to an incident caused by Dermott Brereton in Round 6, violently bumped Brereton to try and take the match winner out of the game, breaking Brereton's ribs. During this period, Ablett had managed to mark and kick the opening goal of the match. Brereton was ordered off the ground, but refused and instead rested in the pocket. Brereton took a mark shortly after and goaled, leading Hawthorn to a 40-point quarter-time lead. Hawthorn coach Alan Jeans commented at the time that Brereton's courage was "inspirational". , Geelong won the second quarter by two points and the third quarter by one point so at three quarter time were still six goals down. The final quarter proved frantic, as Geelong managed to get within six points of the tiring and wounded Hawks, before the siren sounded. Gary Ablett was awarded the Norm Smith Medal for a best on ground performance in kicking nine goals and one behind to equal Collingwood's Gordon Coventry ’s goalkicking record in a grand final. His second quarter goal and third quarter marks were two of his notable highlights of the day. , To cap a remarkable season, Paul Couch won the Brownlow Medal by two votes from Hawthorn 's John Platten . , The decade of the 1990s was another era of disappointed expectations. By the end of the 1990s Geelong Football Club was in crisis, deep in debt and with a depleted player list. , Geelong failed in 1990 to reproduce the exciting brand of attacking football of 1989. Season 1991 started ominously. On the eve of the season, Gary Ablett retired for odd reasons. Nevertheless, Geelong won some games. Ablett returned mid-season to the club. The club finished third at the end of the home and away season. The final against 4th placed St Kilda was a memorable one. Tony Lockett kicked his nine goals for St Kilda by three-quarter time. Billy Brownless, kicked eight goals. The Cats managed to win by seven points. Ablett was suspended for elbowing St Kilda's Nathan Burke , and missed the rest of the season due to suspension. , Over the next two weeks, Geelong met Hawthorn and the West Coast Eagles , both losses for the club. Consistent with the close finish of 1989, Hawthorn won the match by two points. The loss against the Eagles was by fifteen points. , In 1992 Geelong returned to the spectacular form of three seasons previous. Against the Brisbane Bears at Carrara the club kicked a VFL/AFL record score of 37 goals 17 behinds (239 points). This record score still stands.  Gary Ablett Sr. and Billy Brownless both kicked more than 70 goals for the season to form a potent forward-line combination. [ citation needed ] Geelong finished the regular season on top of the ladder, eclipsing their previous record for total points scored in a home-and-away season (2916 in 1989) and increased it to 3057 points.  , After beating Footscray in the qualifying final by 61 points, Geelong lost the 2nd semi final to West Coast Eagles by 38 points, then beat Footscray again in the preliminary final by 64 points. The Cats again squared off against the power of the West Coast Eagles in the Grand Final and got off to a wonderful start, at one stage during the second quarter leading by four goals. However, in the second half West Coast's Peter Matera ran riot, booting five goals and earning himself the Norm Smith Medal as best on ground. The Perth-based West Coast won by 28 points to take the first premiership won by a non-Victorian club. , In 1993 the Geelong once again underachieved as Malcolm Blight experimented with more defensive tactics. For most of the season on-field performances were lacklustre as the players struggled to adapt. It was not until late in the season when Geelong reverted to its all-out attacking style of play. Several experienced players urged Blight to revert to Geelong's customary geisha style of play. Blight agreed and Geelong began to play like champions again. Frustratingly, Geelong narrowly missed the finals on percentage. , In 1993 Blight decided to play Gary Ablett at Full Forward permanently. The move paid handsome dividends, as Ablett reached the second fastest century in VFL/AFL history. Ablett's most notable performances of this year included 11 goals against Melbourne, 14 against Essendon and 10 against the Adelaide Crows – all in losing sides. Tallies of 10 goal against North Melbourne, and 12 against his favourite victim, Richmond, in winning sides. , 1994 proved to be a hard year for the club. The club had a good home-and-away season to finish fourth. Gary Ablett topped the goalkicking for the year easily, kicking 129 goals (including the finals) and winning his second consecutive John Coleman Medal . The club met fifth placed Footscray in the first week of the finals. The match proved a nailbiter, with an after-the-siren kick and goal by Billy Brownless giving the club a five-point win. A week later Geelong had no hope of beating Carlton , who had finished 2nd after the home and away season, given that their three best midfielders; Garry Hocking , Paul Couch and Mark Bairstow were not playing through injury. However, with several young players and second-tier midfielders, along with six goals from Gary Ablett , Geelong defeated Carlton by 33 points. Geelong met North Melbourne in the Preliminary Final in a match which proved even more nailbiting than their match with Footscray 2 weeks prior. North Melbourne started well, but Geelong dominated the second and third quarters to lead by six goals in the third quarter. A fine feat given that Geelong's target all season, Gary Ablett was being beaten by North Melbourne's full back, Mick Martyn . However, North Melbourne came back strongly in the last quarter and took the lead late in the match. However, Geelong scored a behind to level the scores. With 25 seconds left and a boundary throw-in, the ball came to ground and Martyn cleared, only for the ball to be marked by Leigh Colbert . Colbert then kicked long, where ruckman John Barnes dropped the mark, allowing Leigh Tudor , a former North Melbourne player to swoop, and kick the ball over Martyn's head to land in the hand of Gary Ablett . As Ablett walked back to take his kick, the siren went, and Ablett kicked the winning goal, propelling Geelong to its third Grand Final in seven years. , Geelong once again played West Coast for the premiership. Unlike two seasons ago, Geelong proved no match against an Eagles outfit superior to its 1992 premiership team, losing by 80 points. Billy Brownless stood out with a fantastic mark in the second quarter, as well as four goals. Malcolm Blight , dispirited by three Grand Final losses under his tenure, announced his resignation. His assistant Gary Ayres took over the job. Ayres immediately took action, sacking both Steven Hocking (on 199 games) and former captain Mark Bairstow . 1994 saw another best-and-fairest win to Garry Hocking, who also won 20 votes in the Brownlow Medal to finish third to eventual winner Greg Williams on 30 votes and Peter Matera on 28 votes. , 1995 saw the club improve. The club was highly consistent, its biggest losing margin being less than 20 points, and never losing two matches in a row – the only club to do so for the year. The club finished second on the ladder to Carlton. Gary Ablett once again won the Coleman Medal and kicked over 100 goals for the third year in a row. , In the finals the club met 7th placed Footscray and won by 82 points. The club earned a week break and returned for the third weeks clash against Richmond, and won by 78 points and so for the second consecutive season and for the fourth time in seven years, Geelong played for the premiership, this time against Carlton, who had only lost two games for the year. The match was hard to tip, as many saw Geelong a definite chance given that the two sides met once during the year, which saw Carlton win by three points. Geelong was thrashed by 61 points, playing its worst game for the entire season. Gary Ablett played his worst game for years, blanketed by Carlton's Stephen Silvagni . To add insult to injury, former Geelong player Greg Williams , now a superstar at Carlton, was named best on ground with his five goals. A notable rookie of this year would be Brenton Sanderson , who would play over 200 games by the end of career, retiring at the end of 2005, and be recognised with selection into the Geelong Hall of Fame. The Best and Fairest was won by Paul Couch , who narrowly missed out on winning his second Brownlow Medal . , In 1996 the club would experience an unsuccessful year, finishing seventh at the end of the home and away season. Gary Ablett would be suspended for five weeks after round 2, which resulted in a rapid decline in his quality. He would kick his 1000th career goal against Fremantle. The cats would meet eventual premier, North Melbourne in the first week of the finals, which saw North win by over 10 goals. Garry Hocking would once again win the Best and Fairest award, and miss out on the Brownlow Medal by a vote in the process. A notable recruit would be Steven King , standing at over two metres tall. , In 1997 Geelong faced a season with no dependence on ageing superstars, Paul Couch and Gary Ablett . By mid season, Couch would retire on 259 games. Gary Ablett would not play a senior game ever again for the club after injuring his knee in the reserves. The club would start the season well, challenging Carlton to the 1997 Pre-season Premiership, the Ansett Australia Cup. However, identically to 1995, Geelong capitulated, allowing Carlton another piece of silverware. The club finished second on the ladder. The club met North Melbourne in a "home" final at the MCG at Night. North Melbourne, on its actual home ground beat Geelong by 18 points. Geelong then travelled to Adelaide and lost the game by eight points after the umpire failed to pay a courageous Leigh Colbert mark late in the game with Geelong narrowly hanging on to a lead, exiting by losing both finals. , 1998 was a season best forgotten. The club finished 12th, its lowest finish for over 40 years. A notable recruit for Geelong came in the form of Matthew Scarlett , son of former player, John. Geelong took full advantage of the Father-Son Rule . This concession allowed sons of ex-players to nominate for their fathers' clubs, thus exempting them from being chosen by any other club in the national draft. , In 1999 the club won five games straight to open the season. However, the club then lost its next 9 to finish the season with 10 wins and tenth position. The roller-coaster season saw coach Gary Ayres quit to take the job at Adelaide, which ironically was available after Malcolm Blight quit, almost identical to when Ayres took over Geelong in 1995. Mark Thompson was appointed coach. At the end of this season, Geelong traded Leigh Colbert for North Melbourne premiership player, Cameron Mooney . , The 2000 season started well, with Geelong winning its first three matches. By the end of the home and away season Geelong finished fifth and met eighth placed Hawthorn in the first finals match ever played at Docklands Stadium, the AFL's state-of-the-art facility. Hawthorn won by nine points. Barry Stoneham announced his retirement after this game, ending a career spanning over 240 games. This was also the year that the club entered a reserves team into the Victorian Football League. , 2001–2003 saw a lean period for the club where finals were not realised for three years – finishing twelfth, ninth and twelfth respectively.  However, during this time the club recruited well. Current players such as Steve Johnson , Gary Ablett, Jr. , Jimmy Bartel , James Kelly and Andrew Mackie were notable recruits. Veteran Brenton Sanderson won the Best and Fairest in 2001, Steven King in 2002 (who was in that year appointed club captain) and Matthew Scarlett in 2003. There was one highlight of this period, with Geelong winning the 2002 VFL premiership against Port Melbourne. , In 2004 Geelong challenged for the pre-season premiership (known as the Wizard Home Loans Cup), where they met St Kilda in the grand final. Geelong led for much of the match, but St Kilda finished strongly to win by 22 points. The season proved fruitful as the club finished fourth at the end of the home and away season. The club met eventual premier, Port Adelaide at AAMI Stadium / Football Park in Adelaide , historically Geelong's worst ground in terms of wins. Port reaffirmed their superiority at the venue to win by 55 points. Geelong soldiered on, however, and met Essendon at the MCG , winning by ten points despite leading by over six goals at three quarter time. Geelong then met Brisbane , the premiers of 2001–2003. The Cats dominated the first half but it was clear the club lacked a target up forward. In the second half, Brisbane took control and steadied enough to win by a small margin of nine points. Post season, Geelong signed Nathan Ablett to play AFL football for Geelong. Another major signing was disgruntled Richmond big-man Brad Ottens , recruited to counter Geelong's lack of forward line height. Cameron Ling capped off a fine season by winning his first Best and Fairest after finishing runner up in the previous two counts. , The club started very well in 2005, before hitting a slump mid-season as injuries took their toll. By the end of the season, Geelong finished sixth and played seventh placed Melbourne. Geelong thrashed Melbourne by 55 points in a match remembered for Steven King 's attempted kick of the ball in mid air, accidentally making contact with Melbourne ruckman Jeff White , smashing his face, which required surgery. The next week the club met Sydney at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) where the Cats led for the majority of the match. A four goal lead at three quarter time in a low scoring match saw Geelong in a strong position. A stunning final term performance by Sydney's Nick Davis that saw him kick four goals including the winning snap three seconds before the siren denied Geelong victory. Sydney later went on to become the 2005 Premiers. This was Brenton Sanderson 's final game. Joel Corey won his first Best and Fairest. , Season 2006 began promisingly, but ended with criticism by club members of the performance of the club. Geelong beat Adelaide to claim the pre-season NAB Cup . Big wins at home against the Brisbane Lions and Kangaroos in the first two rounds fuelled optimism. However, Geelong began to underperform, losing some close encounters and suffering some humiliating defeats. In the final game of the year, the Cats were soundly beaten by Hawthorn for the second time. Geelong finished tenth on the ladder with ten wins and a draw. Responding to member anger, the Board ordered a comprehensive review of all aspects of the administration of the club and of the club's personnel. Coach Mark Thompson was widely perceived to be at risk. However, the review accepted that Thompson should continue as coach. The Board opted for stability over the uncertainty of radical personnel change. Thompson was publicly outraged by the ordeal which he considered poorly handled. [ citation needed ] , It appeared Geelong would repeat the outcome of the previous season after five rounds of the 2007 season, where Geelong was positioned tenth on the ladder with two wins and three losses, with the latest loss being against the Kangaroos at Skilled Stadium. Following this unexpected loss at their home ground, player Paul Chapman publicly criticised the club's culture,  expressing frustration at the lack of team mentality present with many of the players,  and urging the club as a whole to change this underachieving culture for the better.  Chapman's criticisms, which followed a similar assessment from coach Mark Thompson,  led to a group discussion involving all of the club's playing and coaching staff,  and produced frank assessments of both individuals and the club in general.  This session proved to be a catalyst for the club to begin a transformation of the club's culture, and resulted in a 157-point defeat of Richmond, with Geelong's score of 222 points the club's third-highest overall.  This was the beginning of a winning-streak where the club won 15 games in succession before losing to the second-placed Port Adelaide in round 21. Geelong then succeeded in winning their remaining match of the regular season, where they finished three games clear of Port Adelaide in first position on the ladder, earning the club their first McLelland Trophy since 1992, and qualification for the season's finals series . , Geelong proceeded to defeat the Kangaroos and Collingwood in their qualifying and preliminary finals respectively, the latter being a close game with Collingwood threatening victory late in the match. Geelong ultimately won the match by five points. , These two victories ensured Geelong a place in the 2007 AFL Grand Final against Port Adelaide, which Geelong won by a record margin of 119 points. Geelong scored 24 goals and 19 points for a total of 163 points, compared to the six goals and eight points scored by Port Adelaide for a total of 44 points. Steve Johnson was awarded the Norm Smith Medal after being judged the best player in the match, providing Geelong with just their second Norm Smith Medallist . Cameron Mooney scored the highest number of goals with five, and a total of 11 Geelong players scored at least one goal, with five of those players scoring two goals or more. The win was Geelong's first premiership since 1963, and broke the club's 44-season premiership drought. The club had also won the 2007 VFL premiership against Coburg the weekend before. , Geelong changed their name to the Geelong Cats in 2008 and continued to dominate with the club having a regular season record of 21 wins and one loss to become the best-performing team in the home-and-away season since Essendon in 2000. The club's sole loss occurred in Round 9 with an 86-point deficit against Collingwood. Geelong finished the regular season in first position on the ladder, earning the club a second-consecutive McClelland Trophy, its ninth overall. Geelong then proceeded to win its qualifying and preliminary finals in succession, earning a place in the 2008 AFL Grand Final against Hawthorn and the chance for a second-consecutive premiership. However, Geelong failed to capitalise on its performance during the season, losing the grand final by a margin of 26 points. , Geelong's season began strongly in 2009, with the club winning the 2009 NAB Cup and managing a successive run of victories for the opening 13 rounds of the season. The winning streak was broken when Geelong were defeated by St Kilda in Round 14 by six points. Geelong managed to defeat the reigning premiers, Hawthorn, in the two clubs' second meeting of the season in Round 17. The match was notable with Geelong successfully completing a comeback from a 28-point deficit early in the final quarter to record a victory when an after-the-siren kick Jimmy Bartel scored a point and resulted in a win. Despite not placing first on the ladder at any point during the regular season, Geelong managed a regular-season record of 18 wins and four losses, which was the first time a team had won 18 or more matches in the VFL or AFL's regular season for three consecutive seasons.  After qualifying for the 2009 AFL finals series , Geelong proceeded to win its qualifying and preliminary finals in succession, earning a place in the 2009 AFL Grand Final against St Kilda. Geelong were victorious, defeating St Kilda by 12 points. , This victory marked the first time since 1984 that a grand final had been won by a team which had been trailing at all breaks. The Norm Smith Medal was awarded to Paul Chapman, after gathering 26 possessions and scoring three goals, including the goal which effectively won the match for Geelong. , In addition to the premierships and Norm Smith Medallists, this era of success for the Geelong Football Club was capped by supplying Brownlow Medallists (Bartel and Gary Ablett, Jr. in 2007 and 2009 respectively). Between 2007 and 2009, Geelong players received 13 individual selections in All-Australian teams over the three seasons, including a record nine selections in the 2007 team . Other individual successes include Ablett winning the Leigh Matthews Trophy as the AFL Players Association (AFLPA) Most Valuable Player on a record three occasions and for a record three consecutive seasons from 2007 to 2009. , In 2010, Geelong did not reach the grand final. At the start of 2011, Geelong was all but written off, after coach Mark Thompson left at the end of the 2010 season and the move of Gary Ablett Jr to the Gold Coast Suns. Despite an aging player list and a first year coach in Chris Scott, Geelong managed to beat the reigning premiers, Collingwood, in the two home and away matches that they played against each other. Geelong were the only team to beat Collingwood in the 2011 season and finished second on the ladder behind Collingwood. On 1 October 2011, Geelong and Collingwood played at the MCG for the 2011 AFL Grand Final . With the lead changing a number of times during the game, Geelong gained the lead in the third quarter and did not relinquish it for the rest of the game, with Collingwood failing to score a goal in the last quarter. Jimmy Bartel of Geelong was awarded the Norm Smith medal for the best on ground. , The club has also had a team in the Victorian Football League since the 2000 season which has won three VFL premierships: 2002 against Port Melbourne, 2007 against Coburg and 2012 against Port Melbourne. , Note: This list and details are incomplete , Geelong's traditional navy blue and white hooped guernsey has been worn since the club's inception in the mid-1800s. The design is said to represent the white seagulls and blue water of Corio Bay .  , The team have worn various away guernseys since 1998, all featuring the club's logo and traditional colours.  , "We Are Geelong" is the song sung after a game won by the Geelong Football Club. It is sung to the tune of " Toreador " from Carmen . The lyrics were written by former premiership player John Watts . Only the first verse is used at matches and by the team after a victory. The song currently used by the club was recorded by the Fable Singers in April 1972.  , Head coach , Assistant coaches , , The Geelong reserves team began competing in the VFL Reserves competition with the league's other reserves teams from 1919. From 1919 to 1991 the VFL/AFL operated a reserves competition , and from 1992 to 1999 a de facto AFL reserves competition was run by the Victorian State Football League . The Geelong Football Club fielded a reserves team in both of these competitions, allowing players who were not selected for the senior team to play for Geelong in the lower grade. During that time, the Geelong reserves team won thirteen premierships (1923, 1924, 1930, 1937, 1938, 1948, 1960, 1963, 1964, 1975, 1980, 1981, 1982), the most of any club. , Since the demise of the AFL reserves competition, the Geelong reserves team has competed in the new Victorian Football League , having won three premierships in that time. Unlike all other Victorian AFL clubs, Geelong has never operated in a reserves affiliation with an existing VFL club, having instead operated its stand-alone reserves team continuously. The team is composed of both reserves players from the club's primary and rookie AFL lists, and a separately maintained list of players eligible only for VFL matches. Home games are played at Simonds Stadium , with some played as curtain-raisers to senior AFL matches. , a Essendon refused to play the Grand Final in Geelong, so the premiership was awarded to Geelong.
