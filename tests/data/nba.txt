 United States : , Canada : , The National Basketball Association ( NBA ) is the preeminent men's professional basketball league in North America , and is widely considered to be the premier men's professional basketball league in the world. It has 30 franchised member clubs (29 in the United States and 1 in Canada ), and is an active member of USA Basketball (USAB),  which is recognized by FIBA (also known as the International Basketball Federation) as the national governing body for basketball in the United States. The NBA is one of the four major North American professional sports leagues . NBA players are the world's best paid sportsmen, by average annual salary per player.  , The league was founded in New York City on June 6, 1946, as the Basketball Association of America (BAA).  The league adopted the name National Basketball Association on August 3, 1949, after merging with its rival National Basketball League (NBL). The league's several international as well as individual team offices are directed out of its head offices located in the Olympic Tower at 645 Fifth Avenue in New York City. NBA Entertainment and NBA TV studios are directed out of offices located in Secaucus, New Jersey . , , , The Basketball Association of America was founded in 1946 by owners of the major ice hockey arenas in the Northeastern and Midwestern United States and Canada . On November 1, 1946, in Toronto , Ontario , Canada, the Toronto Huskies hosted the New York Knickerbockers at Maple Leaf Gardens , in a game the NBA now regards as the first played in its history.  The first basket was made by Ossie Schectman of the Knickerbockers. Although there had been earlier attempts at professional basketball leagues, including the American Basketball League and the NBL, the BAA was the first league to attempt to play primarily in large arenas in major cities. During its early years, the quality of play in the BAA was not significantly better than in competing leagues or among leading independent clubs such as the Harlem Globetrotters . For instance, the 1948 ABL finalist Baltimore Bullets moved to the BAA and won that league's 1948 title, and the 1948 NBL champion Minneapolis Lakers won the 1949 BAA title. Prior to the 1948-49 season, however, NBL teams from Fort Wayne, Indianapolis, Minneapolis, and Rochester jumped to the BAA, which established the BAA as the league of choice for collegians looking to turn professional.  , Following the 1948-49 season, the BAA took in the remainder of the NBL: Syracuse, Anderson, Tri-Cities, Sheboygan, Denver, and Waterloo. In deference to the merger and to avoid possible legal complications, the league name was changed from the BAA to the National Basketball Association in spite of having the same BAA governing body including Podoloff.  The new league had seventeen franchises located in a mix of large and small cities,  as well as large arenas and smaller gymnasiums and armories. In 1950, the NBA consolidated to eleven franchises, a process that continued until 1953–54, when the league reached its smallest size of eight franchises, all of which are still in the league (the New York Knicks , Boston Celtics , Golden State Warriors , Los Angeles Lakers , Royals/Kings , Detroit Pistons , Atlanta Hawks , and Nationals/76ers ). The process of contraction saw the league's smaller-city franchises move to larger cities. The Hawks shifted from the "Tri-Cities" (the area now known as the Quad Cities ), to Milwaukee in 1951, and then to St. Louis, Missouri in 1955; the Royals from Rochester, New York to Cincinnati in 1957; and the Pistons from Fort Wayne, Indiana to Detroit in 1957. , Japanese-American Wataru Misaka broke the NBA color barrier in the 1947–48 season when he played for the New York Knicks . He remained the only non-white player in league history prior to the first African-American, Harold Hunter , signing with the Washington Capitols in 1950.   Hunter was cut from the team during training camp,   but several African-American players did play in the league later that year, including Chuck Cooper with the Celtics, Nathaniel "Sweetwater" Clifton with the Knicks, and Earl Lloyd with the Washington Capitols . During this period, the Minneapolis Lakers, led by center George Mikan , won five NBA Championships and established themselves as the league's first dynasty .  To encourage shooting and discourage stalling, the league introduced the 24-second shot clock in 1954.  If a team does not attempt to score a field goal (or the ball fails to make contact with the rim) within 24 seconds of obtaining the ball, play is stopped and the ball given to its opponent. , In 1957, rookie center Bill Russell joined the Boston Celtics , who already featured guard Bob Cousy and coach Red Auerbach , and went on to lead the club to eleven NBA titles in thirteen seasons. Center Wilt Chamberlain entered the league with the Warriors in 1959 and became a dominant individual star of the 1960s, setting new single game records in scoring ( 100 ) and rebounding (55). Russell's rivalry with Chamberlain became one of the greatest rivalries in the history of American team sports. , The 1960s were dominated by the Celtics. Led by Russell, Bob Cousy and coach Red Auerbach, Boston won eight straight championships in the NBA from the 1959–66. This championship streak is the longest in NBA history. They did not win the title in 1966-67 , but regained it in the 1967-68 season and repeated in 1969 . The domination totaled nine of the ten championship banners of the 1960s.  , Through this period, the NBA continued to strengthen with the shift of the Minneapolis Lakers to Los Angeles , the Philadelphia Warriors to San Francisco , the Syracuse Nationals to Philadelphia to become the Philadelphia 76ers , and the St. Louis Hawks moving to Atlanta , as well as the addition of its first expansion franchises. The Chicago Packers (now Washington Wizards ) became the ninth NBA team in 1961. From 1966 to 1968, the league expanded from 9 to 14 teams, introducing the Chicago Bulls , Seattle SuperSonics (now Oklahoma City Thunder ), San Diego Rockets (who relocated to Houston four years later), Milwaukee Bucks , and Phoenix Suns . , In 1967, the league faced a new external threat with the formation of the American Basketball Association (ABA). The leagues engaged in a bidding war. The NBA landed the most important college star of the era, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (then known as Lew Alcindor). However, the NBA's leading scorer, Rick Barry , jumped to the ABA, as did four veteran referees— Norm Drucker , Earl Strom , John Vanak, and Joe Gushue.  , In 1969, Alan Siegel , who oversaw the design of Jerry Dior's Major League Baseball logo a year prior, created the modern NBA logo inspired by the MLB's. It incorporates the silhouette of the legendary Jerry West based on a photo by Wen Roberts, although NBA officials denied a particular player as being its influence because, according to Siegel, "They want to institutionalize it rather than individualize it. It's become such a ubiquitous, classic symbol and focal point of their identity and their licensing program that they don't necessarily want to identify it with one player." The iconic logo debuted in 1971 and would remain a fixture of the NBA brand.   , The ABA succeeded in signing a number of major stars in the 1970s, including Julius Erving of the Virginia Squires , in part because it allowed teams to sign college undergraduates. The NBA expanded rapidly during this period, one purpose being to tie up the most viable cities. From 1966 to 1974, the NBA grew from nine franchises to 18. In 1970, the Portland Trail Blazers , Cleveland Cavaliers , and Buffalo Braves (now the Los Angeles Clippers ) all made their debuts expanding the league to 17.  The New Orleans Jazz (now in Utah ) came aboard in 1974 bringing the total to 18. Following the 1976 season, the leagues reached a settlement that provided for the addition of four ABA franchises to the NBA, raising the number of franchises in the league at that time to 22. The franchises added were the San Antonio Spurs , Denver Nuggets , Indiana Pacers , and New York Nets (now the Brooklyn Nets). Some of the biggest stars of this era were Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , Rick Barry , Dave Cowens , Julius Erving , Elvin Hayes , Walt Frazier , Moses Malone , Artis Gilmore , George Gervin , Dan Issel , and Pete Maravich . The end of the decade, however, saw declining TV ratings, low attendance and drug-related player issues – both perceived and real – that threatened to derail the NBA. , The league added the ABA's innovative three-point field goal beginning in 1979 to open up the game. That same year, rookies Larry Bird and Magic Johnson joined the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers respectively, initiating a period of significant growth in fan interest in the NBA throughout the country and the world. In 1984 they played against each other for the first time in the NBA Finals. Johnson went on to lead the Lakers to five titles, and Bird went on to lead the Celtics to three. Also in the early 1980s, the NBA added one more expansion franchise, the Dallas Mavericks , bringing the total to 23 teams. Later on, Larry Bird won the first three three-point shooting contests. Former league commissioner David Stern who took office on February 1, 1984 before retiring February 1, 2014, oversaw the expansion and growth of the NBA to a global commodity. , Michael Jordan entered the league in 1984 with the Chicago Bulls , providing an even more popular star to support growing interest in the league. This resulted in more cities demanding teams of their own. In 1988 and 1989, four cities got their wishes as the Charlotte Hornets , Miami Heat , Orlando Magic , and Minnesota Timberwolves made their NBA debuts, bringing the total to 27 teams. In the first year of the 1990s, the Detroit Pistons would win the second of their back-to-back titles, led by coach Chuck Daly and guard Isiah Thomas. Jordan and Scottie Pippen would lead the Bulls to two three-peats in eight years during the 1991–98 seasons. Hakeem Olajuwon won back-to-back titles with the Houston Rockets in 1994 and 1995. , The 1992 Olympic basketball Dream Team , the first to use current NBA stars, featured Michael Jordan as the anchor, along with Bird, Johnson, David Robinson , Patrick Ewing , Scottie Pippen, Clyde Drexler , Karl Malone , John Stockton , Chris Mullin , Charles Barkley , and Christian Laettner . Eleven players on the Dream Team have been inducted individually into the Basketball Hall of Fame. , In 1995, the NBA expanded to Canada with the addition of the Vancouver Grizzlies and the Toronto Raptors . In 2001, the Vancouver Grizzlies relocated to Memphis , which left the Raptors as the only Canadian team in the NBA. , In 1996, the NBA created a women's league, the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA). , In 1998, the NBA owners began a lockout which lasted 191 days and was settled on January 18, 1999. As a result of this lockout the 1998–99 NBA season was reduced from 82 to 50 games (61% of a normal season), and the All-Star Game was cancelled. The San Antonio Spurs won their first championship, and first by a former ABA team, by beating the New York Knicks , who were the first, and to this date, the only, eighth seed to ever make it to the NBA Finals. , Since the breakup of the Chicago Bulls championship roster in the summer of 1998, the Western Conference has dominated, with the Los Angeles Lakers and San Antonio Spurs combining to win the title in nine of fourteen years. Tim Duncan and David Robinson won the 1999 championship with the Spurs , and Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant started the 2000s with three consecutive championships for the Lakers. The Spurs reclaimed the title in 2003 against the Nets . In 2004, the Lakers returned to the Finals , only to fall in five games to the Detroit Pistons . , After the Spurs took home the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy in 2005 , the 2006 Finals featured two franchises making their inaugural Finals appearances. The Miami Heat , led by their star shooting guard, Dwyane Wade , and Shaquille O'Neal, who had been traded from the Lakers during the 2004 summer, won the series over the Dallas Mavericks in six after losing the first two games. The Lakers/Spurs dominance continued in 2007 with a four-game sweep by the Spurs over the Cleveland Cavaliers , who were led by LeBron James . The 2008 Finals saw a rematch of the league's highest profile rivalry , the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers , with the Celtics winning, for their 17th championship, thanks to their new big three of Paul Pierce , Ray Allen , and Kevin Garnett . , In 2009, the Lakers with Kobe Bryant returned to the Finals , this time defeating the Dwight Howard-led Orlando Magic .  Kobe Bryant won his first Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award in his 13th season after leading the Lakers to their first NBA championship since the departure of Shaquille O'Neal.  , The 2010 NBA All-Star Game was held at Cowboys Stadium in front of the largest crowd ever, 108,713.  At the end of that season, the Celtics and the Lakers renewed their rivalry from 2008 when they met again in the NBA Finals for a record 12th time. The Lakers won the title in Game 7, 83–79.  Before the start of the 2010–11 season the NBA had an exciting summer with one of the most anticipated free agent classes of all time. Two of which signed, and one resigned, with the Miami Heat, leading to a season that was heavily centered on their eventual success or failure at taking home the championship. The Heat, led by LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh, did in fact make the Finals against the Dallas Mavericks, in a rematch for the franchises of the 2006 Finals. The Mavericks, led by Dirk Nowitzki (the eventual NBA Finals MVP), took the series in six games. This was the Mavericks' first title. Other veterans like Shawn Marion , Jason Kidd, Jason Terry , and Peja Stojaković also won their first titles with Nowitzki. , On July 1, 2011, at 12:01 am, the NBA announced another lockout .  After the first few weeks of the season were canceled, the players and owners ratified a new collective bargaining agreement on December 8, 2011, setting up a shortened 66-game season.  Following the shortened season, the Miami Heat made a return to the Finals with the trio of Dwyane Wade, Lebron James and Chris Bosh against Oklahoma City's Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook and James Harden. The Heat went on to defeat the Thunder in five games, capturing their second NBA title in six years. , Following pioneers like Vlade Divac ( Serbia ) and Dražen Petrović ( Croatia ) who joined the NBA in the late 1980s, an increasing number of international players have moved directly from playing elsewhere in the world to starring in the NBA. Below is a short list of foreign players who have won NBA awards or have been otherwise recognized for their contributions to basketball, either currently or formerly active in the league: , On some occasions, young players, most but not all from the English-speaking world, have attended U.S. colleges before playing in the NBA. Notable examples are: , Since 2006, the NBA has faced Euroleague teams in exhibition matches in the NBA Europe Live Tour and since 2009 in the Euroleague American Tour . , The 2013–14 season opened with a record 92 international players on the opening night rosters, representing 39 countries and comprising over 20% of the league  The NBA defines "international" players as those born outside the 50 United States and Washington, D.C. This means that: , In 2001, an affiliated minor league , the National Basketball Development League, now called the NBA Development League (or D-League) was created.  Before the league was started, there were strong rumors that the NBA would purchase the Continental Basketball Association , and call it its developmental league. , In 2004, two years after the Hornets' relocation to New Orleans , the NBA returned to North Carolina as the Charlotte Bobcats were formed as an expansion team . , In 2005, the Hornets relocated to Oklahoma City for two seasons because of damage caused by Hurricane Katrina . In 2007, the Hornets returned to New Orleans. , On June 28, 2006, a new official game ball was introduced for the 2006–07 season, marking the first change to the ball in over 35 years and only the second ball in 60 seasons.  Manufactured by Spalding , the new ball featured a new design and new synthetic material that Spalding claimed offered a better grip, feel, and consistency than the original ball. However, many players were vocal in their disdain for the new ball, saying that it was too sticky when dry, and too slippery when wet. , On December 11, 2006, Commissioner Stern announced that beginning January 1, 2007, the NBA would return to the traditional leather basketball in use prior to the 2006–07 season. The change was influenced by frequent player complaints and confirmed hand injuries (cuts) caused by the microfiber ball.  The Players' Association had filed a suit in behalf of the players against the NBA over the new ball.  As of 2006, the NBA team jerseys are manufactured by Adidas , which purchased the previous supplier, Reebok . , On July 19, 2007, the Federal Bureau of Investigation investigated allegations that veteran NBA referee Tim Donaghy bet on basketball games he officiated over the past two seasons and that he made calls affecting the point spread in those games.  On August 15, 2007, Donaghy pleaded guilty to two federal charges related to the investigation. However, he could face additional charges if it is determined that he deliberately miscalled individual games. Donaghy claimed in 2008 that certain refs were friendly with players and "company men" for the NBA. Donaghy alleged that refs influenced the outcome of certain playoff and finals games in 2002 and 2005. NBA commissioner David Stern denied the allegations and said Donaghy was a convicted felon and a "singing, cooperating witness".  Donaghy served 15 months in prison and was released in November 2009.  According to an independent study by Ronald Beech of Game 6 of the NBA 2002 Western Conference Finals between the Lakers and Kings, although the refs increased the Lakers' chances of winning through foul calls during the game, there was no collusion to fix the game. On alleged "star treatment" during Game 6 by the refs toward certain players, Beech claimed, "there does seem to be issues with different standards and allowances for different players."  , On July 2, 2008, it was announced that the Seattle SuperSonics would relocate to Oklahoma City . The Oklahoma City Thunder began playing in the 2008–09 season. , On October 11, 2008, the Phoenix Suns and the Denver Nuggets played the first outdoor game in the modern era of the NBA at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden .  , On September 1, 2009, the contract between the NBA and its referees expired, creating a referee lockout. On October 1, 2009, the first preseason games were played and replacement referees from the WNBA and NBA Development League were used. The last time replacement referees were used was the beginning of the 1995–96 season.  The NBA and the regular referees reached a deal on October 23, 2009.  , In 2011, the first official NBA league games on European ground took place. In two matchups, the New Jersey Nets faced the Toronto Raptors in London 's O2 Arena in front of over 20,000 fans. , In July 2011, the NBA laid off around 114 league employees (about 11 percent of all the league office workforce) to save money.  , The 2011–12 NBA season , scheduled to begin November 1, 2011, with a matchup between the defending champion Dallas Mavericks and the Chicago Bulls, was postponed due to a labor dispute . The lockout officially ended on December 8, 2011, when players and owners ratified a new collective bargaining agreement, and the season began on Christmas Day. , On April 30, 2012, the New Jersey Nets officially changed their name to the Brooklyn Nets . They began playing in the New York City borough of Brooklyn in the 2012–13 season. , In October 2012, the NBA announced that it would begin fining players for flopping .  , After the 2012–13 season, the New Orleans Hornets renamed themselves the Pelicans. During the 2013-14 season, Stern retired as commissioner after 30 years, and deputy commissioner Adam Silver ascended to the position of commissioner. During that season's playoffs, the Bobcats officially reclaimed the Hornets name, and by agreement with the league and the Pelicans, also received sole ownership of all history, records, and statistics from the Pelicans' time in Charlotte. As a result, the Hornets are now officially considered to have been founded in 1988, suspended operations in 2002, and resumed in 2004 as the Bobcats, while the Pelicans are officially treated as a 2002 expansion team.  (This is somewhat similar to the relationship between the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Ravens in the NFL .) , In April 2014 Donald Sterling , an NBA owner at the time, received a lifetime ban from the NBA after racist remarks he made became public. , On August 5, 2014, Becky Hammon was hired by the San Antonio Spurs as an assistant coach, becoming the second female coach in NBA history but the first full-time coach.  This also makes her the first full-time female coach in any of the four major professional sports in North America.  , The NBA originated in 1946 with 11 teams, and through a sequence of team expansions, reductions, and relocations currently consists of 30 teams. The United States is home to 29 teams and one is located in Canada. , The current league organization divides thirty teams into two conferences of three divisions with five teams each. The current divisional alignment was introduced in the 2004–05 season . Reflecting the population distribution of the United States and Canada as a whole, most teams are in the eastern half of the country: thirteen teams are in the Eastern Time Zone , nine in the Central , three in the Mountain , and five in the Pacific . , Following the summer break, teams begin training camps in late September. Training camps allow the coaching staff to evaluate players (especially rookies), scout the team's strengths and weaknesses, prepare the players for the rigorous regular season, and determine the 12-man active roster (and a 3-man inactive list) with which they will begin the regular season. Teams have the ability to assign players with less than two years of experience to the NBA development league. After training camp, a series of preseason exhibition games are held. Preseason matches are sometimes held in non-NBA cities, both in the United States and overseas. The NBA regular season begins in the last week of October. , During the regular season, each team plays 82 games, 41 each home and away. A team faces opponents in its own division four times a year (16 games). Each team plays six of the teams from the other two divisions in its conference four times (24 games), and the remaining four teams three times (12 games). Finally, each team plays all the teams in the other conference twice apiece (30 games). This asymmetrical structure means the strength of schedule will vary between teams (but not as significantly as the NFL or MLB ). Over five seasons, each team will have played 80 games against their division (20 games against each opponent, 10 at home, 10 on the road), 180 games against the rest of their conference (18 games against each opponent, 9 at home, 9 on the road), and 150 games against the other conference (10 games against each team, 5 at home, 5 on the road). , The NBA is one of only two of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada in which teams play every other team during the regular season (the other being the National Hockey League ). Each team hosts and visits every other team at least once every season. From 2005 to 2008, the NBA had the distinction of being the only one of the four major leagues in which all teams play every other team. , The NBA is also the only league that regularly schedules games on Christmas Day.  The league has been playing games regularly on the holiday since 1947,  though the first Christmas Day games weren't televised until 1983–84 .  Games played on this day have featured some of the best teams and players.    Christmas is also notable for NBA on television, as the holiday is when the first NBA games air on network television each season.   Games played on this day have been some of the highest-rated games during a particular season. , In February, the regular season pauses to celebrate the annual NBA All-Star Game . Fans vote throughout the United States, Canada, and on the Internet , and the top vote-getters at each position in each conference are given a starting spot on their conference's All-Star team. Coaches vote to choose the remaining 14 All-Stars. Then, Eastern conference players face the Western conference players in the All-Star game. The player with the best performance during the game is rewarded with a Game MVP award . Other attractions of the All-Star break include the Rising Stars Challenge (originally Rookie Challenge), where the top rookies and second-year players in the NBA play in a 5-on-5 basketball game, with the current format pitting U.S. players against those from the rest of the world; the Skills Challenge , where players compete to finish an obstacle course consisting of shooting, passing, and dribbling in the fastest time; the Three Point Contest , where players compete to score the most amount of three-point field goals in a given time; and the NBA Slam Dunk Contest , where players compete to dunk the ball in the most entertaining way according to the judges. These other attractions have varying names which include the names of the various sponsors who have paid for naming rights. , Shortly after the All-Star break is the trade deadline , which is set to fall on the 16th Thursday of the season (usually in February) at 3pm Eastern Time .   After this date, teams are not allowed to exchange players with each other for the remainder of the season, although they may still sign and release players. Major trades are often completed right before the trading deadline, making that day a hectic time for general managers. , Around the middle of April, the regular season ends. It is during this time that voting begins for individual awards, as well as the selection of the honorary, league-wide, post-season teams. The Sixth Man of the Year Award is given to the best player coming off the bench (must have more games coming off the bench than actual games started). The Rookie of the Year Award is awarded to the most outstanding first-year player. The Most Improved Player Award is awarded to the player who is deemed to have shown the most improvement from the previous season. The Defensive Player of the Year Award is awarded to the league's best defender. The Coach of the Year Award is awarded to the coach that has made the most positive difference to a team. The Most Valuable Player Award is given to the player deemed the most valuable for (his team) that season. Additionally, Sporting News awards an unofficial (but widely recognized) Executive of the Year Award to the general manager who is adjudged to have performed the best job for the benefit of his franchise. , The post-season teams are the All-NBA Team , the All-Defensive Team , and the All-Rookie Team ; each consists of five players. There are three All-NBA teams, consisting of the top players at each position, with first-team status being the most desirable. There are two All-Defensive teams, consisting of the top defenders at each position. There are also two All-Rookie teams, consisting of the top first-year players regardless of position. , NBA Playoffs begin in late April, with eight teams in each conference competing for the Championship. The three division winners, along with the team with the next best record from the conference are given the top four seeds. The next four teams in terms of record are given the lower four seeds. , Having a higher seed offers several advantages. Since the first seed begins the playoffs playing against the eighth seed, the second seed plays the seventh seed, the third seed plays the sixth seed, and the fourth seed plays the fifth seed, having a higher seed means a team faces a weaker team in the first round. The team in each series with the better record has home court advantage, including the First Round. This means that, for example, if the team who receives the 5 seed has a better record than the team with the 4 seed (by virtue of a divisional championship), the 5 seed would have home court advantage, even though the other team has a higher seed. Therefore, the team with the best regular season record in the league is guaranteed home court advantage in every series it plays. For example, in 2006, the Denver Nuggets won 44 games and captured the Northwest Division and the #3 seed. Their opponent was the #6 seed Los Angeles Clippers , who won 47 games and finished second in the Pacific Division. Although Denver won its much weaker division, the Clippers had home-court advantage and won the series in 5. , The playoffs follow a tournament format. Each team plays an opponent in a best-of-seven series, with the first team to win four games advancing into the next round, while the other team is eliminated from the playoffs. In the next round, the successful team plays against another advancing team of the same conference. All but one team in each conference are eliminated from the playoffs. Since the NBA does not re-seed teams, the playoff bracket in each conference uses a traditional design, with the winner of the series matching the 1st and 8th seeded teams playing the winner of the series matching the 4th and 5th seeded teams, and the winner of the series matching the 2nd and 7th seeded teams playing the winner of the series matching the 3rd and 6th seeded teams. In every round, the best-of-7 series follows a 2–2–1–1–1 home-court pattern, meaning that one team will have home court in games 1, 2, 5, and 7, while the other plays at home in games 3, 4, and 6. From 1985 to 2013, the NBA Finals followed a 2–3–2 pattern, meaning that one team had home court in games 1, 2, 6, and 7, while the other played at home in games 3, 4, and 5.  , The final playoff round, a best-of-seven series between the victors of both conferences, is known as the NBA Finals , and is held annually in June. The victor in the NBA Finals wins the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy . Each player and major contributor—including coaches and the general manager—on the winning team receive a championship ring. In addition, the league awards the Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award to the best performing player of the series. , On August 2, 2006, the NBA announced the new playoff format. The new format takes the three division winners and the second-place team with the best record and rank them 1–4 by record. The other 4 slots are filled by best record other than those other 4 teams.  Previously, the top three seeds went to the division winners. , The Boston Celtics have won the most championships with 17 NBA Finals wins. The second most successful franchise is the Los Angeles Lakers , who have 16 overall championships (11 in Los Angeles, 5 in Minneapolis). Following the Lakers are the Chicago Bulls with six championships, all of them over an 8-year span during the 1990s, and the San Antonio Spurs with five championships, all since 1999. , Current teams that have no NBA Finals appearances: , The National Basketball Association has sporadically participated in international club competitions. From 1987 to 1999 the NBA champions played against the continental champions of the Fédération Internationale de Basketball (FIBA) in the McDonald's Championship . This tournament was won by the NBA invitee every year it was held. FIBA is organizing a new World Club Championship to begin in 2010, and currently plans to invite the NBA champions starting in 2011.  , In 2012, a ticket cost from $10 to $3,000 apiece, depending on the location of the seat and the success of the teams that were playing.  , List of National Basketball Association awards , 1961 , 1966 , 1967 , 1968 , 1970 , 1974 , 1980 , 1988 , 1989 , 1995 , 2004  The Boston Celtics ( pronounced  /ˈsɛltɪks/ ) are an American professional basketball team based in Boston , Massachusetts . They play in the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Founded in 1946 and one of eight NBA teams (out of 23 total teams) to survive the league's first decade, the team is currently owned by Boston Basketball Partners LLC. The Celtics play their home games at the TD Garden , which they share with the National Hockey League 's Boston Bruins . The franchise's seventeen championships are the most for any NBA franchise, and account for 25.4% of all NBA championships since the league's founding in 1946.  This makes the Boston Celtics the most successful franchise to date in the major four traditional North American professional sports. [ note 1 ] , The Celtics have met the Lakers a record twelve times in the Finals, including their most recent appearances in 2008 and 2010, where the Celtics have won nine meetings (but only two since 1980). Four Celtics ( Bob Cousy , Bill Russell , Dave Cowens and Larry Bird ) have won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award for an NBA record total of ten MVP awards.  Their mascot 'Lucky the Leprechaun' is a nod to the team's Irish heritage and to Boston's historically large Irish population .  , The Celtics rose again after struggling through the 1990s to win a championship in 2008 with the help of Kevin Garnett , Paul Pierce , and Ray Allen .  Pierce and Garnett were later traded to the Brooklyn Nets , and Rajon Rondo was traded to the Dallas Mavericks in December 2014. , , , The Boston Celtics were formed in 1946 by Boston Garden-Arena Corporation President Walter A. Brown as a team in the Basketball Association of America , and became part of the National Basketball Association after the absorption of the National Basketball League by the BAA in the fall of 1949.  In 1943, the Celtics signed Chuck Cooper , becoming the first franchise to draft a black player.  , The Celtics struggled during their early years, until the hiring of coach Red Auerbach .  In the franchise's early days, Auerbach had no assistants, ran all the practices, did all the scouting—both of opposing teams and college draft prospects—and scheduled all the road trips. One of the first great players to join the Celtics was Bob Cousy , whom Auerbach initially refused to draft out of nearby Holy Cross because he was "too flashy".  Cousy eventually became the property of the Chicago Stags ,  but when that franchise went bankrupt, Cousy went to the Celtics in a dispersal draft. After the 1955–56 season, Auerbach made a stunning trade. He sent perennial All-Star Ed Macauley to the St. Louis Hawks along with the draft rights to Cliff Hagan in exchange for the second overall pick in the draft.  After negotiating with the Rochester Royals —a negotiation that included a promise that the Celtics owner would send the highly sought-after Ice Capades to Rochester if the Royals would let Russell slide to #2—Auerbach used the pick to select University of San Francisco center Bill Russell .  Auerbach also acquired Holy Cross standout, and 1957 NBA Rookie of the Year, Tommy Heinsohn .  Russell and Heinsohn worked extraordinarily well with Cousy, and they were the players around whom Auerbach would build the champion Celtics for more than a decade.  , With Bill Russell, the Celtics advanced to the NBA Finals and defeated the St. Louis Hawks in seven games, giving the Celtics the first of their record seventeen championships. Russell later won 11 championships, making him the most decorated player in NBA history.  In 1958, the Celtics again advanced to the NBA Finals , this time losing to the Hawks in 6 games.  However, with the acquisition of K.C. Jones that year, the Celtics began a dynasty that would last for more than a decade.  In 1959, the Celtics won the NBA Championship after sweeping the Minneapolis Lakers , the first of their record eight consecutive championships.  During that time, the Celtics met the Lakers in the Finals five times, starting an intense and often bitter rivalry that has spanned generations. In 1964, the Celtics became the first NBA team to have an all African American starting lineup. On December 26, 1964, Willie Naulls replaced an injured Tommy Heinsohn, joining Tom ‘Satch’ Sanders, K.C. Jones, Sam Jones and Bill Russell in the starting lineup. The Celtics defeated St. Louis 97-84. Boston won its next 11 games with Naulls starting in place of Heinsohn.  , The Boston Celtics of the late-1950s–60s are widely considered as one of the most dominant teams of all time.  , Auerbach retired as coach after the 1965–66 season and Russell took over as player-coach, which was Auerbach's ploy to keep Russell interested.  With his appointment, Russell also became the first African American coach in any U.S. pro sport.  Auerbach would remain the General Manager, a position he would hold well into the 1980s. However, that year the Celtics' string of NBA titles was broken as they lost to the Philadelphia 76ers in the Eastern Conference Finals. The aging team managed two more championships in 1968 and 1969, defeating the Lakers each time in the NBA Finals.  Russell retired after the 1969 season, effectively ending a dominant Celtics dynasty that had garnered 11 NBA titles in 13 seasons.  The streak of 8 consecutive championships is the longest streak of consecutive championships in U.S. professional sports history.  , The 1970 season was a rebuilding year, as the Celtics had their first losing record since the 1949–50 season. However, with the acquisition of Dave Cowens , Paul Silas , and Jo Jo White , the Celtics soon became dominant again.  After losing in the Eastern Conference Finals in 1972, the Celtics regrouped and came out determined in 1973 and posted an excellent 68–14 regular season record. But the season ended in disappointment, as they were upset in 7 games by the New York Knicks in the Conference Finals. John Havlicek injured his right shoulder in game six and was forced to play game 7 shooting left handed.  The Celtics returned to the playoffs the next year, defeating the Milwaukee Bucks in the NBA Finals in 1974 for their 12th NBA Championship .  The teams split the first four games, and after the Celtics won Game 5 in Milwaukee they headed back to Boston leading 3 games to 2, with a chance to claim the title on their home court. However, the Bucks won Game 6 when Kareem Abdul-Jabbar nestled in a hook shot with 3 seconds left in the game's second overtime, and the series returned to Milwaukee. But Cowens was the hero in Game 7, scoring 28 points, as the Celtics brought the title back to Boston for the first time in five years. In 1976, the team won yet another championship, defeating the Phoenix Suns in 6 games. The Finals featured one of the greatest games in the history of the NBA. With the series tied at two games apiece, the Suns trailed early in the Boston Garden, but came back to force overtime. In double overtime, a Gar Heard turn-around jumper at the top of the key sent the game to an unprecedented third overtime, at which point the Celtics prevailed.  Tommy Heinsohn coached the team for those two championships. After the 1976 championship and a playoff appearance in 1977 , Boston went into another phase of rebuilding. In the 1977 NBA Draft , the Celtics drafted a young forward from UNC Charlotte named Cedric Maxwell .  "Cornbread" Maxwell did not contribute much in his rookie season, but he showed promise. Auerbach's job became even tougher following the 1977–78 season in which they went 32–50 as John Havlicek , the Celtics' all-time leading scorer, retired after 16 seasons.  , The Celtics owned two of the top eight picks in the 1978 NBA Draft .  Since the Celtics had two draft choices, Auerbach took a risk and selected junior Larry Bird of Indiana State with the 6th pick, knowing that Bird would elect to remain in college for his senior year. The Celtics would retain his rights for one year—a rule that was later changed—and Auerbach believed that Bird's potential would make it worth the wait. Auerbach also felt that when the college season ended the Celtics would have a great chance to sign Bird. Auerbach was right and Bird signed soon after leading Indiana State to the NCAA Championship game, where they fell to a Michigan State University team. (The other pick was Freeman Williams , who was traded before the 1978–79 season began.) , In 1978, owner Irv Levin was looking to move to his native California. Since there was hardly any chance that the NBA would consider moving the Celtics out of Boston, Levin entered into an arrangement with John Y. Brown, Jr. , who at the time was the owner of the Buffalo Braves and who had also owned the Kentucky Colonels of the ABA . Brown traded ownership of the Braves for Levin's stake in the Celtics, thus allowing Brown to remain as a team owner and freeing up Levin to make the move he desired to make. Thus, Brown became the new owner of the Celtics while Levin moved the Braves to San Diego, California where they became known as the San Diego Clippers . , As part of the deal, trades were made between the Braves/Clippers franchise and the Celtics franchise which resulted in many former Braves joining the team. One of the moves that irked Auerbach was a trade that Brown made with the Braves that saw his franchise center Bob McAdoo join the Celtics for three first round draft picks that Auerbach had planned on using for the future rebuilding project he was trying to undertake.  The dispute nearly led to Auerbach resigning as General Manager for a position with the New York Knicks . With public support strongly behind Auerbach, Brown sold the team to Harry Mangurian rather than run the risk of having Auerbach leave the team.  The Celtics would struggle through the season, going 29–53 without Bird.  Newcomers Chris Ford , Rick Robey , Cedric Maxwell and Tiny Archibald failed to reverse the team's momentum.  , Bird debuted for the Celtics during the 1979–80 season, a year after being drafted.  With a new owner in place, Auerbach made a number of moves that would bring the team back to prominence. He almost immediately traded McAdoo,  a former NBA scoring champion, to the Detroit Pistons for guard M. L. Carr , a defensive specialist and legendary towel-waving Celtic cheerleader, and two first-round picks in the 1980 NBA Draft .  He also picked up point guard Gerald Henderson from the CBA . Carr, Archibald, Henderson and Ford formed a highly competent backcourt, with their unique skills blending in perfectly with the talented frontcourt of Cowens, Maxwell and Bird, who would go on to win NBA Rookie of the Year honors.  The Celtics improved by 32 games, which at the time was the best single-season turnaround in NBA history, going 61–21 and losing to the Philadelphia 76ers in the Eastern Conference Finals.  , After the season, Auerbach completed what may be the most lopsided trade in NBA history. Auerbach had always been a fan of stockpiling draft picks, so even after the success of the 1979–80 season, the Celtics had both the 1st and 13th picks in the 1980 NBA Draft left over from the M. L. Carr trade. Auerbach saw an opportunity to improve the team immediately, sending the two picks to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for center Robert Parish  and the Warriors' first round pick, the 3rd overall. With the draft pick, Auerbach picked University of Minnesota power forward Kevin McHale .  With these three future Hall of Famers on the team, henceforth known as the first "Big 3", the Celtics had a core in place to become a dominant team again in the NBA. , The Celtics went 62–20 under coach Bill Fitch in 1980–81 ,  despite losing center Dave Cowens to retirement late in training camp. Once again the Celtics matched up with the 76ers in the Eastern Conference Finals. Boston fell behind 3 games to 1 before coming back to win a classic 7th game, 91–90. The Celtics went on to capture the 1981 NBA Championship over the Houston Rockets ,  just two years after Bird had been drafted. Maxwell was named NBA Finals MVP .  The following year the Celtics once again tried to come back from a 3–1 deficit against the Sixers in the rematch but this time lost Game 7 at Boston Garden.  In 1983 the Celtics were swept in the playoffs for the first time by the Milwaukee Bucks ;  afterwards Fitch resigned and the team was sold to new owners led by Don Gaston .  , In 1983–84 the Celtics, under new coach K. C. Jones , would go 62–20 and finally get back to the NBA Finals after a three-year hiatus.  In the finals, the Celtics came back from a 2–1 deficit to defeat the Los Angeles Lakers , winning their 15th championship.  Bird renewed his college rivalry with Lakers star Magic Johnson during this series. After the series Auerbach officially retired as General Manager but maintained the position of team President.  Auerbach was succeeded by Jan Volk as General Manager.  Volk had been with the Celtics since graduating from Columbia Law School in 1971 and had been the team's General Counsel since 1976 and the team's Assistant G.M. since 1980. During the off-season, in Volk's first major transaction since assuming the GM role, the Celtics traded Henderson to the Seattle SuperSonics in exchange for their first round pick in the 1986 NBA Draft . , In 1985, the Lakers and Celtics met again, but this time the Lakers took the championship.  This was the first time the Lakers had defeated the Celtics for a championship, as well as the only time that the Celtics lost a championship at Boston Garden. During the following off-season the Celtics acquired Bill Walton from the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for Cedric Maxwell .  Walton was a big star with the Portland Trail Blazers , but injuries had kept him from living up to expectations. He was willing to come off the bench, deferring to the three big men already with the team. Walton, considered the best passer of all NBA centers in history, stayed healthy and was a big part of the Celtics' success in 1986. , In 1985–86 the Celtics fielded one of the best teams in NBA history. The 1986 Celtics won 67 games, going 40–1 at the Boston Garden . Bird won his third consecutive MVP award and Walton won the Sixth Man of the Year Award . They won the franchise's 16th championship and last of the 20th century, defeating the Houston Rockets in the NBA Finals 4 games to 2. , Thanks to the 1984 trade of Gerald Henderson and the subsequent fall of the Seattle SuperSonics , at the end of the 1985–86 the Celtics owned not only the best team in the NBA but also the second pick in the 1986 NBA Draft . The Celtics drafted Len Bias with the pick and had high hopes for the young University of Maryland star.  Fans believed Bias had superstar potential, and that he would be the perfect complement to the aging, but still strong, Celtics. The hope was that his presence would ensure that the franchise would remain a powerhouse after Bird, McHale and Parish retired. Unfortunately, Bias died 48 hours after he was drafted, after using cocaine at a party and overdosing.  It would be the first in a long string of bad luck for the Celtics, one that would continue until the next manifestation of the 'Big Three' in Boston. , It was also during the 1986 season that the Celtics became known for the off-court antics of Susan “Busty Heart” Sykes , a well-endowed spectator whom television cameras scanned across during a 1986 game. Sykes's newfound fame, coupled with the team's success, made her a pop-culture icon in Boston for the next several years and launched her career in adult entertainment.  , Despite the loss of Bias, the Celtics remained competitive in 1986–87 , going 59–23 and again winning the Eastern Conference Championship.  However, injuries took its toll, and the Celtics ceded the NBA championship to the Lakers in six games. It would be 21 years before they would reach the NBA Finals again. The Celtics' reign as the Eastern Conference champions ended in 1988, losing to the Detroit Pistons in six games.  , After the 1987–88 season, head coach K.C. Jones retired. Jones was replaced as head coach by assistant Jimmy Rodgers . Rodgers faced immediate trouble in 1988–89 when, only 6 games into the season, Larry Bird decided to have surgery to remove bone spurs in both feet. The injury was to sideline Bird until well after the All-Star Break, although he hoped to return that year. However, despite his best attempts to return he was unable to make it back as the Celtics stumbled to a 42–40 record and a first round playoff defeat to the Detroit Pistons . , Bird returned in 1989–90 to play in 75 games and he led the Celtics to a 52–30 record. In the playoffs , after winning the first two games of a Best of 5 series against the New York Knicks , the Celtics collapsed, losing 3 straight, including the decisive 5th game at the Boston Garden . In the wake of the embarrassing defeat, Rodgers was fired and replaced by assistant coach (and former Celtic player) Chris Ford . , Under Ford's leadership the Celtics improved to 56–26 in 1990–91 , recapturing the Atlantic Division title even though Bird missed 22 games with a variety of injuries. The Celtics fell to the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference Semifinals. In 1992, a late season rally allowed the Celtics to catch the New York Knicks and repeat as Atlantic Division champions. The team finished 51–31 and again matched up with the Indiana Pacers in the First round, this time sweeping the series 3 games to 0. In the Eastern Conference Semifinals the Celtics lost a grueling 7 game series to the Cleveland Cavaliers , 4 games to 3. Due to back problems, Larry Bird played in only 45 of the 82 regular season games, and only 4 of the 10 playoff games; during games he was frequently lying on the floor when out of the lineup, instead of sitting on the bench. , After thirteen seasons with the club and winning a gold medal in the Barcelona Olympics with the Dream Team , Bird retired in 1992, primarily due to his back injuries. , At the time of Bird's retirement, former Celtics guard Chris Ford was the coach of the Celtics.  26-year-old Reggie Lewis (out of Boston's Northeastern University ) was seen as Bird's successor as the franchise player for the Celtics. Lewis, a small forward , fainted during a 1993 first round playoff matchup with the Charlotte Hornets (the Celtics lost in four games).  It was later revealed that Lewis had heart problems,  yet he was able to get doctors to clear him for a comeback. He died of a heart attack while shooting baskets at Brandeis University during the offseason.  The Celtics honored his memory during the following season by retiring his number 35.  , The original Big Three era came to an end in 1994, after Robert Parish signed with the Hornets  The year before, Kevin McHale retired after the Celtics' playoff loss to the Hornets. The Celtics finished the year out of the playoffs with a 32–50 mark. , In 1994, the Celtics hired former player M. L. Carr to be the team's new V.P. of Basketball Operations, working alongside G.M. Jan Volk. In his first draft in charge of the Celtics, he drafted University of North Carolina star Eric Montross with his first round draft pick. Montross became the new heir apparent in the paint, but failed to develop and was eventually traded. 1994–95 was the Celtics' final season in the Boston Garden . The Celtics signed the aging Dominique Wilkins as a free agent, and he led the team in scoring with 17.8 PPG. Second-year player Dino Radja , a power forward from Croatia , added an interior presence to the team that had been lacking 1993–94 . The Celtics made the playoffs, losing to the heavily favored Orlando Magic in 4 games. , In 1995, the Celtics moved from the Boston Garden to the Fleet Center (later TD BankNorth, then TD Garden ). Carr fired Chris Ford and took the coaching reins himself. After drafting Providence College star Eric Williams , the Celtics struggled to a 33–49 record. Things got worse in 1996–97 as the Celtics lost a franchise record 67 games, setting an unwanted NBA record winning only once against other Atlantic Division teams and winning only fifteen times overall despite the emergence of 1st-round draft pick Antoine Walker . Carr's stint as coach is considered a failure. Carr stepped aside to another job in the organization when Celtics principal owner Paul Gaston convinced star college coach Rick Pitino to join the franchise as the team's president, director of basketball operations, and head coach .  Pitino's appointment as team president was controversial as Auerbach, who had filled that role for more than 25 years, first heard about this change from local media people. Unfortunately for the franchise, Pitino was not the savior everyone expected him to be. Auerbach bore the insult of being elbowed out with dignity, even as the team failed to improve. , The Celtics received the third and sixth draft picks in the 1997 NBA Draft ,  and used the picks to select a brand new backcourt. They drafted Chauncey Billups and Ron Mercer and dismantled much of the young team that lost 67 games the year before. David Wesley , Dino Radja and Rick Fox were let go, and Williams was traded to the Denver Nuggets for a pair of second round draft picks (Williams would return to the Celtics in 1999 and played for four years). Billups was subsequently traded to the Raptors during his rookie year and Ron Mercer .  was traded to the Nuggets during his third season. , The following year the Celtics drafted Paul Pierce in the 1998 NBA Draft ,  a college star who had been expected to be drafted much earlier than the Celtics' 10th overall pick. Pitino also acquired veteran Kenny Anderson , for future Finals MVP Billups and Dee Brown . Pitino failed to achieve meaningful success and resigned in 2001.  , Following the resignation of Rick Pitino, the Celtics saw modest improvement under coach Jim O'Brien . Paul Pierce matured into an NBA star and was ably complemented by Antoine Walker, along with the other players acquired over the years. The team finished the season 24–24 under O'Brien  (after going 12–22 before Pitino's resignation) and following the 2000–01 season O'Brien was given the job of head coach on a permanent basis. As a result of numerous trades, the Celtics had three picks in the 2001 NBA Draft , a luxury that seemed to set the franchise up well for the long term. General Manager Chris Wallace used the picks on Joe Johnson , Joe Forte (a favorite of Red Auerbach ) and Kedrick Brown . Only Johnson managed to succeed in the NBA, becoming a perennial All-Star after leaving the Celtics; Forte and Brown were busts. , The Celtics entered the 2001–02 season with low expectations. The team's success in the latter stages of 2000–01 was largely forgotten, and critics were surprised when the team, along with the New Jersey Nets , surged to the top of the Atlantic Division ahead of teams like the Philadelphia 76ers , who were fresh off a trip to the NBA Finals . The Celtics won a hard-fought 5-game series with the 76ers in the first round, 3 games to 2. Pierce scored 46 points in the series-clinching blowout at the Fleet Center . In the Conference Semifinals, the Celtics defeated the favored Detroit Pistons 4 games to 1 in a series best remembered for the Celtics low-scoring Game 3 victory, 66–64. In their first trip to the Eastern Conference Finals since 1988 , the Celtics jumped out to a 2–1 series lead over the New Jersey Nets, after rallying from 21 points down in the fourth quarter to win Game 3, but would lose the next three games to fall 4 games to 2.  , In 2003, the Celtics were sold by owner Paul Gaston to Boston Basketball Partners L.L.C.,  led by H. Irving Grousbeck , Wycliffe Grousbeck and Steve Pagliuca . The team made it back to the playoffs but were swept by the Nets in the second round, despite bringing Game 4 to double overtime.  , Before their elimination, the team hired former Celtic guard Danny Ainge as General Manager, moving Chris Wallace to another position in the organization. Ainge believed the team had reached its peak and promptly sent Antoine Walker to the Dallas Mavericks (along with Tony Delk ).  In return, the Celtics received the often-injured Raef LaFrentz , Chris Mills , Jiri Welsch ,  and a first-round pick in 2004 . The Celtics made the playoffs , only to be swept in the first round by the Indiana Pacers , losing all 4 games by blowout margins.  , The Celtics were a young team under new coach Doc Rivers during the 2004–05 season,  having drafted youngsters Al Jefferson , Delonte West and Tony Allen in the 2004 Draft. Yet they seemed to have a core of good young players, led by Pierce and rookie Al Jefferson , to go along with a group of able veterans. The Celtics went 45–37 and won their first Atlantic Division title since 1991–92 , receiving a boost from returning star Antoine Walker in mid-season. The Pacers defeated them in the first round yet again, with the series culminating in an embarrassing 27-point loss in Game 7 at the Fleet Center . After the season Walker was traded again, this time to the Miami Heat , where he went on to win a championship next season. Despite Pierce's career season, in which he averaged career-highs in points (26.8), the Celtics missed the playoffs with a 33–49 record, owing largely to a young roster and constant roster shuffling, which saw the likes of Marcus Banks , Ricky Davis and Mark Blount traded for underachieving Michael Olowokandi and former all-star Wally Szczerbiak . , The Boston Celtics continued to rebuild on the night of the 2006 NBA Draft . Danny Ainge traded the rights to seventh overall pick Randy Foye , Dan Dickau and Raef LaFrentz to the Portland Trail Blazers for NYC high school phenom Sebastian Telfair , Theo Ratliff and a future second-round pick.  The Celtics traded a first-round pick in the 2007 NBA Draft to the Phoenix Suns for the 21st selection, with which Ainge selected Kentucky point guard Rajon Rondo , who was to become a key piece in the Celtics' revival. In the second round the Celtics added Leon Powe to the team.  On July 6, 2006, Allan Ray was signed as a free agent.  , The 2006–07 season was a gloomy one for the franchise. The season began with the death of Red Auerbach at 89.  Auerbach was one of the few remaining people who had been a part of the NBA since its inception in 1946. The Celtics went 2–22 from late December 2006 through early February 2007 after losing Paul Pierce to injury, the result of a stress reaction in his left foot. At first, the Celtics received a much needed boost from guard Tony Allen but he tore his ACL and MCL on a needless dunk attempt after the whistle in a game vs. the Indiana Pacers on January 10, 2007.  The Celtics compiled a record of 24–58, second-worst in the NBA, including a franchise record 18-game losing streak that lasted from January 5 to February 14.  At the end of the season, the Celtics, with the second worst record in the NBA, were at least hopeful that they could secure a high draft pick and select either Greg Oden or Kevin Durant to help rebuild the franchise. During one of the most anticipated draft lotteries Boston has ever experienced, fans watched the Celtics end up falling as low as they could in the lottery to fifth. It seemed to many to be one misfortune in a long line of bad luck beginning with the death of Len Bias, but disappointment led to eventual redemption. , The Celtics completed the largest single-season turnaround in NBA history. The new Big Three of Pierce, Allen and Garnett went 66–16 in the regular season, an unprecedented 42-game improvement. However, the team struggled initially in the playoffs. The Atlanta Hawks took them the full seven games in the first round, as did the Cleveland Cavaliers in the conference semifinals. The Celtics defeated the Detroit Pistons in six games of the Eastern Conference Finals, winning two road games.  , In the 2008 NBA Finals, the Celtics faced MVP Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers for the 11th time, the first time since 1987. The Celtics won Game 1 at home 98-88, fueled by strong play by Garnett and Pierce's dramatic comeback from a second half knee injury. They would also go on to win Game 2 108-102, despite nearly blowing a 24-point lead in the fourth quarter. As the series shifted to Los Angeles, the Lakers stifled Pierce and Garnett in Game 3 and won 87-81. However, the Celtics would overcome a 24-point deficit in Game 4 to win 97-91, the largest comeback in NBA Finals history. After once again blowing a large lead, the Lakers hung on to win Game 5 103-98, sending the series back to Boston. In Game 6, the Celtics overpowered the Lakers, winning 131-92, clinching their 17th NBA title, and first since 1986. It remains the most lopsided win ever in a championship-clinching game; Paul Pierce was named Finals MVP.  The win in Game 6 was a sense of relief, as it was a difficult path to this championship; in that game, these Celtics set a record for most games a team had ever played in a postseason, with 26, surpassing the 1994 New York Knicks , whom Coach Doc Rivers played for, and the 2005 Detroit Pistons , each of whom played 25, but lost their respective finals in seven games (Knicks in 1994 , Pistons in 2005 ).  , The 2008–09 Celtics started off the season at 27–2, the best starting record in NBA history.  They also had a pair of 10+ game winning streaks including a franchise record 19-game streak.  After the All Star Break, Kevin Garnett was injured in a loss against the Utah Jazz , missing the last 25 games of the season. Garnett was eventually shelved for the playoffs. The 2009 Celtics still finished with 62 victories, but their playoff run would end against the Magic in the second round, losing in seven games after leading 3–2, the first such occurrence in team history.  In the prior round they were pushed to a Game 7 against the Chicago Bulls, with four of those games went to overtime, yet the Celtics' experience was too much for the young Bulls.  , The following year, with the return of Kevin Garnett from injury and the additions of Rasheed Wallace and Marquis Daniels , the Celtics started the season 23–5 and at one point had the best record in the NBA. However Doc Rivers ultimately decided to lessen his aging stars' minutes to keep them fresh for the playoffs. As a result the Celtics sputtered to an even 27–27 record the rest of the way and finished the 2009–10 regular season with a 50–32 record, with a better road (26–15) than home (24–17) record.  Despite previous predictions that the Celtics would never go deeper into the playoffs, the Celtics still managed to make the NBA Finals despite their lowly fourth seeding. They defeated the Miami Heat in five games, upset the top-seeded Cavaliers in six games and toppled the defending Eastern Conference Champion Magic, avenging their loss from the previous season. Rajon Rondo finally emerged as a bonafide superstar during post-season play, continuing his rise to fame beginning with his first All-Star appearance.  , The Celtics and the Lakers met for the 12th time in the NBA Finals. After taking a 3–2 lead heading into Los Angeles for Game 6, the Celtics appear poised to pack in their 18th title. But Kendrick Perkins , the team's starting center, suffered a severe knee injury early in Game 6,  and the Celtics would lose Game 6, and go on to blow a 13-point lead in Game 7. After speculation that coach Doc Rivers would resign to spend more time with his family, he affirmed on June 30, 2010 that he would return to the team for the 2010–11 season. , During the 2010 off season, with Perkins expected to be out until February 2011, the Celtics signed two former All-Star centers, Shaquille O'Neal and Jermaine O'Neal , for insurance; they also signed Turkish center Semih Erden , their 2008 second round pick . The Celtics also welcomed back Delonte West to back up Rondo. During the 2010–11 season, Paul Pierce became the third Celtic to score 20,000 points, joining Larry Bird and John Havlicek . Ray Allen broke the NBA record for most three-pointers made in a career, while the Celtics won 3,000 games, the second team to do so. On February 17, however, Kendrick Perkins was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder partially due to the expectation that Shaquille O'Neal would return from his injuries to fill Perkins' role. The Celtics were 33–10 in games Perkins had missed during the year due to injury,  and they were 19–3 in games that O'Neal played over 20 minutes.  The Celtics were 41–14 at the time of the trade and held the Eastern Conference leaderboard despite another rash of injuries. Following the trade, however, they proceeded to win only 15 of their final 27 games to finish with a 56–26 record, sliding to the third seed, due to the difficult adjustment of new Celtics such as Jeff Green , Nenad Krstić and Carlos Arroyo as well as player injuries. Shaquille O'Neal played only five minutes after February 1.   The Celtics swept the New York Knicks 4–0 in the opening round of the 2011 NBA Playoffs , but in the second round they were ousted by the Miami Heat in five games. Shaquille O'Neal missed the first round of the playoffs, and he was limited to 12 minutes in two games in the second round against the Heat (lost to Mavericks in NBA Finals).  Shaquille O'Neal retired at the end of the season. , At the 2011 NBA Draft , the Celtics selected Providence Friar swingman MarShon Brooks with the 25th overall pick then immediately traded his rights to the Brooklyn Nets for the rights to the 27th overall pick, power forward JaJuan Johnson . Then the Celtics selected E'Twaun Moore with the 55th overall pick in the 2nd round (reason being for his choice of #55), which reunited the Purdue teammates. During the short preseason following the 2011 NBA lockout , the Celtics signed free agents Marquis Daniels, Chris Wilcox , Keyon Dooling and Greg Stiemsma , while acquiring Brandon Bass from the Magic for Glen Davis and Von Wafer . They also re-signed Jeff Green , only to have it voided after a physical revealed that Green was diagnosed with an aortic aneurysm , forcing him to miss the season. The Celtics started the season 0–3 with Paul Pierce out with a heel injury. To fill the void, the Celtics signed French swingman Mickaël Piétrus , but did not make his season debut until January 6, 2012 against the Indiana Pacers. The Celtics, however, continued to struggle, at one point posting a five-game losing streak that was the longest in the 'Big Three' era. At the All Star break, the Celtics were below .500 with a 15–17 record. However, they were one of the hottest teams after the break, going 24–10 the rest of the year and winning their 5th division title in a row. The Celtics would end up making the playoffs as the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference in the 2012 NBA Playoffs. , In the playoffs, the Celtics faced the Atlanta Hawks in the first round, beating them in six games led by strong play from Pierce and Garnett. In the Conference Semifinals the Celtics faced the Philadelphia 76ers led by Doug Collins and a young group of promising players that would push the Celtics into a full-seven game series. Following a Game 7 85–75 win the Celtics faced the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals, who had defeated them in the playoffs the previous year. After losing Game 1 93–79, Boston fought back, pushing Miami into a Game 2 overtime, but ultimately fell short losing 115–111. Facing a 0–2 deficit heading back to Boston, the Celtics would come back with a strong 101–91 Game 3 win and then a hard fought 93–91 Game 4 overtime win, with Dwyane Wade missing a potential game-winning three-point shot at the buzzer. The C's then won Game 5 in Miami 94–90, giving them a chance to take the series back at the Garden. The Celtics couldn't close out the series however. Game 6 ended up in a blowout home loss of 98-79 taking the series back to Miami for Game 7, where the Celtics built an early lead but eventually lost 101-88; Miami would go on to defeat the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Finals. , 2012 became a pivotal off season for Danny Ainge's Celtics, as both Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett became free agents and only six players remained under contract ( Rajon Rondo , Paul Pierce , Avery Bradley , JaJuan Johnson , E'Twaun Moore & Sean Williams ). In the 2012 NBA Draft , the Celtics drafted three players, Jared Sullinger , Fab Melo and Kris Joseph with their 21st, 22nd and 51st picks respectively. The Celtics re-signed their free agents Kevin Garnett , Brandon Bass and Keyon Dooling along with Chris Wilcox and Jeff Green , who both were returning to play after sustaining season-ending heart ailments. The Celtics also signed former Dallas Mavericks shooting guard Jason Terry . On July 20, the Celtics acquired free agent Courtney Lee in a three-team sign and trade, sending JaJuan Johnson, E'Twaun Moore, Sean Williams and future second round pick to the Houston Rockets and Sasha Pavlovic to Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for Lee. Jason Collins was later signed to a one-year deal. However, Allen chose to sign with the Miami Heat , for less money, bringing the five-year "Big Three" era to a somewhat acrimonious end. , On September 20, Keyon Dooling was waived by the Celtics following his retirement from basketball, however, Dooling came back from retirement and signed with the Memphis Grizzlies later that year. In addition the Celtics signed center Darko Miličić and guard Leandro Barbosa . [ citation needed ] , Later in the season, it was announced that Miličić would return to Europe for a family matter. On December 24, the Celtics signed forward Jarvis Varnado of the NBA D-League team Sioux Falls to a deal. He was then waived on January 6 along with rookie forward Kris Joseph. , On January 27, 2013, it was revealed that Rajon Rondo had torn the ACL on his right knee and would miss the rest of the season along with part of the next season. On February 2, it was announced that Jared Sullinger would also miss the rest of the season due to back surgery. , Despite losing Rondo and Sullinger to injury, the Celtics compiled a seven-game winning streak, including victories over the Heat in double overtime and the Nuggets in triple overtime. The winning streak was snapped on February 12 when Leandro Barbosa suffered a torn ACL; he would miss the rest of the season as well. , Then on February 18, the Celtics signed swingman Terrence Williams to a deal. On February 21, the Celtics traded Leandro Barbosa and center Jason Collins for Washington Wizards guard Jordan Crawford. On February 28 and March 21, respectively, the Celtics signed forwards D. J. White and Shavlik Randolph .   , The Celtics finished the season with 41 wins, but played only 81 games after a home game against the Indiana Pacers on April 16 was cancelled following the Boston Marathon bombings ; the game was not made up with both teams already assured of their playoff positions.  The 41 wins were the lowest totals the Celtics achieved as a playoff-bound team since 2004. The Celtics trailed 3–0 to the New York Knicks in the first round of the 2013 NBA Playoffs , before losing the series in six games. In Game 6, the Celtics nearly completed a come back when they went on a 20-0 run to cut the lead to 4, but that was the closest they got as the New York Knicks would take over to win. , On June 3, 2013, head coach Doc Rivers was allowed out of his contract to coach Los Angeles Clippers and the Celtics were given a 2015 unprotected first round pick as compensation. , A few days later, on June 28, 2013, ESPN reported that Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett (after waiving his no-trade clause), along with Jason Terry and D. J. White , were traded to the Brooklyn Nets for Keith Bogans , MarShon Brooks , Kris Humphries , Kris Joseph , Gerald Wallace , and three future first-round draft picks (2014, 2016, 2018), with the option of swapping 2018 pick with Brooklyn's 2017 pick.  The deal was later approved by the league on July 12, 2013, effectively ending the 'Big 3' era and marking the start of a youth movement for the team.  , On July 3, 2013, the Celtics announced that Brad Stevens , the head coach of Butler University , would replace Doc Rivers as Head Coach.  , On July 27, 2013, the Celtics traded their 16th overall pick with the Mavericks' 13th to select Kelly Olynyk out of Gonzaga.  Olynyk would go on to make the NBA All-Rookie 2nd team. , On January 15 the Celtics traded Jordan Crawford and MarShon Brooks to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for future first and second round picks as well as Miami Heat center Joel Anthony . , On January 17, 2014, Rajon Rondo made his return from an ACL tear. He was named the new Captain of the Boston Celtics, the 15th Team Captain in team history. , On June 26, 2014, the Celtics drafted Marcus Smart with the 6th overall pick and James Young with the 17th overall pick in the 2014 NBA Draft .  , On July 10, 2014, Tyler Zeller and Marcus Thornton were traded to the Celtics in a three-team trade involving the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Brooklyn Nets. , On July 21, 2014, Evan Turner agreed to sign with the Celtics using the Mid-level exception. , On December 18, 2014, Rondo and rookie Dwight Powell were traded to Dallas for center Brandan Wright , forward Jae Crowder and veteran point guard Jameer Nelson , plus future picks.  On January 9, 2015, the Celtics traded Jeff Green to the Memphis Grizzlies in exchange for Tayshaun Prince and sent newly acquired center Brandan Wright to the Phoenix Suns. A few days later, they also traded Jameer Nelson to the Denver Nuggets for Nate Robinson but waived him a few days later. This left Brandon Bass and Avery Bradley as the only players left from the 2012 NBA Playoffs Celtics roster. On February 19, 2015, Boston acquired Isaiah Thomas from the Phoenix Suns in exchange for Marcus Thornton and the Cleveland Cavaliers' 2016 first-round draft pick in a last-minute trade deadline deal.  On that same day, February 19, 2015, the Celtics also traded Tayshaun Prince in a deal that netted them Luigi Datome and Jonas Jerebko from the Detroit Pistons.  On February 23, 2015, soon after the All-Star break, it was announced that Jared Sullinger, the team's leading scorer and rebounder, who was averaging 14.4 points and 8.1 rebounds, would miss the remainder of the season with a left metatarsal stress fracture; Sullinger returned on April 3, 2015 on limited minutes.  The Celtics finished the season with a 40-42 record, but still managed to clinch the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference Playoffs .  The Celtics were swept by the second seeded Cleveland Cavaliers , led by LeBron James , in the first round of the 2015 NBA Playoffs  , The rivalry between the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers involves the two most storied franchises in NBA history. It has been called the NBA's best rivalry.  The two teams have met a record twelve times in the NBA Finals , starting with their first Finals meeting in 1959 . They would go on to dominate the league in the 1960s and the 1980s, facing each other six times in the 1960s, three times in the 1980s, in 2008, and in 2010. , The rivalry had been less intense since the retirements of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird in the early 1990s, but in 2008 it was renewed as the Celtics and Lakers met in the Finals for the first time since 1987, with the Celtics winning the series in six games. They faced off once again in the 2010 NBA Finals which the Lakers won in seven games. The two teams have won the two highest numbers of championships, the Celtics 17, the Lakers 16; together, the 33 championships account for almost half of the 67 championships in NBA history. , The Celtics and the 76ers are the two teams who have the most meetings in the NBA Playoffs , playing each other in nineteen series, of which the Celtics have won twelve.  Some [ who? ] consider this to be the 2nd greatest rivalry in the NBA next to the Celtics–Lakers rivalry . The rivalry reached its peak when players Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain of the 76ers played each other from 1965 to 1968. Their play would result in the Celtics not winning every NBA Finals series in the 1960s when the Sixers won in 1967. During the early 1980s, the teams constantly fought for conference championships with Larry Bird leading the Celtics and Julius Erving leading the 76ers. , The rivalry between the Celtics and the Detroit Pistons peaked in the 1980s, featuring players such as Larry Bird , Kevin McHale , Robert Parish , Isiah Thomas , Bill Laimbeer , Dennis Rodman , and Joe Dumars . These teams met in the NBA Playoffs five times in seven seasons from 1985 to 1991, with the Celtics winning in 1985 and 1987, and the Pistons coming out on top en route to back-to-back Finals appearances in 1988 and their championship seasons of 1989 and 1990 . Led by Paul Pierce , Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen in the 2008 Eastern Conference Finals the Celtics defeated the Pistons in 6 games to advance to the NBA Finals where they went on to beat the Lakers also in 6 games. , The rivalry between the Celtics and the New York Knicks rivalry stems from the location of the teams, both of which are in the NBA's Atlantic division. Also, the rivalry is heated due to the ongoing rivalry between the cities of Boston and New York. The teams have played with each other 512 total times during the regular season, with the Celtics leading their series 276 to 175. The two teams have also played each other 61 total times during the playoffs, with the Celtics leading this series 34 to 27. , The Boston Celtics were once rivals of the New Jersey Nets during the early 2000s due to their respective locations and their burgeoning stars. The Nets were led by Jason Kidd and Kenyon Martin, while the Celtics were experiencing newfound success behind Paul Pierce and Antoine Walker. The rivalry began to heat up in the 2002 Eastern Conference Finals, which was preceded by trash talking from the Celtics  who claimed Martin was a "fake" tough guy. Things progressed as the series started, and on-court tensions seemed to spill into the stands. Celtic fans berated Kidd and his family with chants of "Wife Beater!"  in response to Kidd's 2001 domestic abuse charge. When asked about the fan barbs being traded, Kenyon Martin stated, "Our fans hate them, their fans hate us." Bill Walton said at the time that Nets-Celtics was the "beginning of the next great NBA rivalry" during the Eastern Conference Finals in 2002 with the Nets advancing to the NBA Finals, though New Jersey would go on to sweep Boston in the 2003 playoffs. In 2012, the year the Nets returned to New York in the borough of Brooklyn, there were indications that the rivalry might be rekindled when an altercation occurred on the court on November 28, resulting in the ejection of Rajon Rondo , Gerald Wallace, and Kris Humphries. Rondo was suspended for two games in the aftermath, while Wallace and Kevin Garnett were fined.  The story was revisited on December 25, when Wallace grabbed Garnett's shorts and the two had to be broken up by referees and players alike. However, the rivalry between the Nets and the Celtics appeared significantly cooled off by the June 2013 blockbuster trade that dealt Celtics stars Garnett and Paul Pierce to the Nets in exchange for Wallace, Humphries, and others. This move was billed as a merger of the two Atlantic Division teams.  Celtics announcer Sean Grande said "It's almost as if you found a great home for these guys. You couldn't have found a better place. These guys will be in the New York market, they'll be on a competitive team, they'll stay on national TV. It's funny, because the enemy of my enemy is my friend. So with Celtics fans feeling the way they do about the Heat , feeling the way they do about the Knicks , the Nets are going to become almost the second [Boston] team now."  , , The Celtics hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who isn't signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.  This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. , The Boston Celtics released a new logo for the 1996–97 season , although the depiction of a leprechaun spinning a basketball has been in use since the early 1950s. The leprechaun logo was originally designed by Zang Auerbach, the brother of Celtics head coach Red Auerbach . The logo has received numerous tweaks over the years; the latest version decorated the leprechaun in a gold vest to celebrate the club's 50th anniversary.  , The most familiar version, however, is the one-colored logo used during the Larry Bird era, with the leprechaun traced in black and only green and white clothes, which is still used on some TV networks whenever the current Celtics logo is unavailable or in classic Celtics references.  The logo made its debut midway through the 1975–76 season , albeit in green pants, at the center court of their trademark parquet floor . The official version with white pants debuted in the 1976–77 season . In the 1993–94 season , the pants on the center court were repainted white. Finally in the 1996–97 season , in coinciding with the team's (and the NBA's) 50th anniversary, the Celtics repainted the leprechaun logo to include gold on the vest, bow tie and hat, as well as brown on the ball and shillelagh , and black on its pants and shoes. Its face and hands were both painted tan. The one-colored leprechaun logo was revived for the 2011–12 season as an alternate logo, and is currently seen on the team website as well as banners during post-game interviews. , The Celtics also have various alternative logos, with the most popular being a white shamrock with the letters "Celtics" above it, wrapped in a green circle, which has been used since the 1998–99 season . The alternate logo is based on logos used by the Celtics before they used the Zang Auerbach leprechaun. For much of its history, the shamrock was trimmed in gold, as seen in the old team warmup jackets. A new secondary logo, unveiled in 2014, featured a variation of the leprechaun logo, albeit in silhouette form. , The Celtics jerseys have always been green on away games and white on home games since their inception in 1946. Except for some minor modifications, most notably the road 'Boston' script and the serifed version of the uniforms during the Bill Russell era, the jerseys remained unchanged through the years. , Beginning in 2005–06 , the Celtics began using alternate home/road jerseys which are green with black lettering and trim featuring the word "Boston" on the front side of the jersey. The alternate road jersey made few appearances in its first 2 seasons, but since 2007 it has been used much more often, in more than half of the road games. The uniforms traditionally make their debut on the last Friday of November home games, and are used on the road for games after that. In the 2011–12 season the uniforms were used sparingly, twice during the regular season, and during the first two games of the Eastern Conference Finals . , Also, in 2005–06 , the Celtics began a tradition of wearing green jerseys with gold trim as part of the St. Patrick's Day celebrations the NBA puts into place every third week of March. Except for the word "Boston" in front and the gold trim, the St. Patrick's Day jerseys resemble the regular road jerseys. For the first four years, the St. Patty's jerseys were used four times, a majority of which on the road; however in the 2009–10 NBA season , they were used just twice (both home games). They wore them six times in the 2011–12 season; wearing them at its earliest on March 9, their final home game before an eight-game road trip. The uniform was the only one in the current Celtics set that does not use the Adidas Revolution 30 design. , During the 2006–07 season , the Celtics wore a commemorative patch of a black shamrock with the nickname "Red" in green letters on the right top of the jersey in remembrance of Red Auerbach , who died shortly prior to the beginning of the season.  , During the NBA Europe Live Tour prior to the 2007–08 season , the Celtics used the alternate road jerseys in their game against the Toronto Raptors in Rome, except that the words "Boston" on the front side of the jersey and the shamrock on the shorts and on the reverse side of the jersey contained the green, white and red tricolors of the Italian flag . In the second game in London, the regular road jerseys featured a patch containing the Union Jack . , At the 2008–09 season opener against the Cleveland Cavaliers , the Celtics wore a modified version of their home uniforms, accented with gold, to commemorate last season's championship team. , In the 2012–13 season , the Celtics wore a special edition Christmas Day uniform known as 'Big Color'. The uniform is entirely green, with the exception of logos and lettering traced in white. , In the 2013–14 season , the Celtics replaced their former alternate St. Patrick's uniform with a new, sleeved version. Unlike the previous uniform, the front featured the team name in front, gold side panels and a white shamrock at the back, while the shorts closely resemble the green/black third uniform save for the gold accents. , A home grey alternate sleeved uniform was unveiled during the 2014–15 season . The uniform features a serifed vertical arch 'Celtics' wordmark in white with green trim, with names in green and numbers in white with green trim. In addition, it features a pattern of the Celtics' famed parquet floor on the sides, a silhouette version of their leprechaun logo on the waistband, and a green shamrock on the left leg of the shorts. It will be seen on six home dates during the season. , The team has honored deceased members of the Celtics family with a commemorative black band on the left shoulder strap of the jersey. It has been featured seven times in the history of the franchise: Walter Brown ( 1964–65 ), Bob Schmertz ( 1975–76 ), Joan Cohen ( 1989–90 ), Johnny Most ( 1993–94 ), Reggie Lewis ( 1993–94 ), Dorothy Auerbach ( 2000–01 ) and Dennis Johnson ( 2006–07 ).  , The team also had the tradition of wearing black sneakers through most of their history, except during the early 1980s when they wore green sneakers. According to legend, Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach had a problem with the white sneakers, claiming that the white sneakers can easily get dirty; hence starting a long tradition with the black sneakers. But prior to the 2003–04 season , current Celtics GM Danny Ainge and captain Paul Pierce suggested wearing white sneakers, in due part to a growing number of teams wearing black sneakers. Auerbach gladly accepted and the white sneakers have remained since on home games. They still wear the black sneakers on away games, but in the 2008–09 season , they wore white sneakers with green and gold accents while wearing their St. Patrick's Day jerseys on the road. Most recently, when the Celtics play on Christmas Day , they wore white or green sneakers with red and gold accents.  Since the 2009–10 season, the NBA relaxed its rules on specified sneaker colors, allowing several players such as Rajon Rondo to wear white sneakers on the road, or black at home, and sometimes solid green either home or away. , The Celtics were the only team to wear warmup jackets with the player names on the back. During the 1980s, this style was dominant in most NBA warmup jackets, but by the late 1990s, this style gradually declined. The Celtics, however, kept the design in keeping with tradition, before discontinuing the practice after the 2011–12 season. By that time Adidas issues a new warmup jacket design annually, and since the 2009–10 season, they provide players with a customized shooting shirt with the player's name and uniform number on the back. , Comcast SportsNet New England is currently the Boston Celtics' main television outlet, having aired its games since 1981. Most Celtics games began to air on the network full-time in 1998, and has held the distinction since. Before the 2007–08 Celtics season, the TV station was known as FSN New England and prior to 1997, it was known as SportsChannel New England. On October 1, 2007 the station transformed to the company Comcast, and is currently Comcast SportsNet. Comcast SportsNet broadcasts all Celtics games, except games that are nationally televised on TNT and ABC. Second and third rounds of the playoffs, and NBA Finals games are not broadcast on Comcast SportsNet. Mike Gorman, Tommy Heinsohn, and Abby Chin are the broadcasters for Comcast SportsNet during Celtics games with Mike Gorman going the play-by-play announcing, Tommy Heinsohn doing the color announcing and Abby Chin doing the sideline reporting. Various guest analysts, some with Celtic ties, serve during Celtics road games. , The Celtics can be heard on the WEEI Sports Radio Network during all Boston Celtics games, all season long from preseason to postseason. The play-by-play announcer is Sean Grande with commentary from Cedric Maxwell. , On September 26, 2013, the Celtics and 98.5 The Sports Hub announced a multi-year partnership in which the Boston Celtics games will be broadcast on the market's leading sports station. Beginning with the 2013–14 season, 98.5 The Sports Hub will feature select pre-season games, and all regular and post-season matchups, as well as produce extended pre- and postgame shows focused entirely on the Celtics.   The Brooklyn Nets are an American professional basketball team based in Brooklyn , New York City , New York , that competes in the National Basketball Association (NBA). They are a member of the league's Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference . The team was established in 1967 as a charter franchise of the NBA's rival league, the American Basketball Association (ABA). They were known as the New Jersey Americans during their first season, before moving to Long Island in 1968 and changing their name to the New York Nets . During this time, the Nets won two ABA championships (in 1974 and 1976). In 1976, the ABA merged with the NBA, and the Nets were absorbed into the NBA along with three other ABA teams (the San Antonio Spurs , Indiana Pacers and Denver Nuggets , all of whom remain in the league today). , In 1977, the team returned to the nearby state of New Jersey and played as the New Jersey Nets from 1977 to 2012. During this time, the Nets won two consecutive Eastern Conference championships (in the 2001–02 and 2002–03 seasons), but failed to win a championship. In the summer of 2012, the team moved to the Barclays Center in Brooklyn and was renamed the Brooklyn Nets.  , , , The Brooklyn Nets were founded in 1967 and initially played in Teaneck, New Jersey , as the New Jersey Americans . In its early years, the team led a nomadic existence, moving to Long Island in 1968 and playing in various arenas there as the New York Nets .  , Led by Hall of Famer Julius "Dr. J" Erving , the Nets won two ABA championships in New York before becoming one of four ABA teams to be admitted into the NBA as part of the ABA–NBA merger in 1976. The team then moved back to New Jersey in 1977 and became the New Jersey Nets . During their time in that state, the Nets saw periods of losing and misfortune intermittent with several periods of success, which culminated in two consecutive NBA Finals appearances in the 2001–02 and 2002–03 seasons by teams led by point guard Jason Kidd . , After playing 35 seasons in New Jersey, the team moved back to the state of New York, changed its geographic name to Brooklyn, and began playing in the new Barclays Center , starting with the 2012–13 NBA season .   , The Boston Celtics were once rivals of the Nets during the early 2000s because of their respective locations and their burgeoning stars. The Nets were led by Jason Kidd and Kenyon Martin, while the Celtics were experiencing newfound success behind Paul Pierce and Antoine Walker. The rivalry began to heat up in the 2002 Eastern Conference Finals, which was preceded by trash-talking from the Celtics  who claimed Martin was a "fake" tough guy. Things progressed as the series started, and on-court tensions seemed to spill into the stands. Celtic fans berated Kidd and his family with chants of "Wife Beater!"  in response to Kidd's 2001 domestic abuse charge. When the series returned to New Jersey, Nets fans responded, with some brandishing signs that read "Will someone please stab Paul Pierce?"  referring to a night club incident in 2000 in which Pierce was stabbed 11 times. When asked about the fan barbs being traded, Kenyon Martin stated, "Our fans hate them, their fans hate us." Bill Walton said at the time that Nets-Celtics was the "beginning of the next great NBA rivalry" during the Eastern Conference Finals in 2002 with the Nets advancing to the NBA Finals, though New Jersey would go on to sweep Boston in the 2003 playoffs. , In 2012, there were indications that the rivalry might be rekindled when an altercation occurred on the court on November 28, resulting in the ejection of Rajon Rondo , Gerald Wallace, and Kris Humphries. Rondo was suspended for two games in the aftermath, while Wallace and Kevin Garnett were fined.  The story was revisited on December 25, when Wallace grabbed Garnett's shorts and the two had to be broken up by referees and players alike. , However, the rivalry between the Nets and the Celtics appeared significantly cooled off by the June 2013 blockbuster trade that dealt Celtics stars Garnett and Paul Pierce to the Nets in exchange for Wallace, Humphries, and others. This move was billed as a merger of the two Atlantic Division teams.  Celtics announcer Sean Grande said "It's almost as if you found a great home for these guys. You couldn't have found a better place. These guys will be in the New York market, they'll be on a competitive team, they'll stay on national TV. It's funny, because the enemy of my enemy is my friend. So with Celtics fans feeling the way they do about the Heat , feeling the way they do about the Knicks , the Nets are going to become almost the second [Boston] team now."  , The Knicks–Nets rivalry has historically been a geographical one, with the Knicks playing in Madison Square Garden in the New York City borough of Manhattan and the Nets playing in the New York City suburbs of Long Island and in New Jersey , and since 2012, at Barclays Center in the New York City borough of Brooklyn . Media outlets have noted the Knicks–Nets rivalry's similarity to those of other New York City teams, such as Major League Baseball 's Subway Series rivalry between the American League 's New York Yankees and the National League 's New York Mets and National Football League 's rivalry between the NFC East 's New York Giants and the AFC East 's New York Jets , the result of the boroughs' proximity through the New York City Subway . Historically, the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn competed via the Dodgers–Giants rivalry , when the two teams were known as the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants . Like the Knicks and Nets, the Giants and Dodgers played in Manhattan and Brooklyn, respectively, and were fierce divisional rivals.  The rivalry between the New York Islanders and New York Rangers of the National Hockey League will also have this distinction once the Islanders move to Barclays Center in 2015.  Due to the Knicks being located in Manhattan and the Nets being located in Brooklyn, some media outlets have dubbed this rivalry "Clash of the Boroughs".   , A rivalry with the Toronto Raptors had emerged in 2004, when then-Raptor Vince Carter had been traded to the then-New Jersey Nets.  However, the two teams would not meet in the playoffs until 2007 , when the Nets defeated the Raptors in the First Round series, 4–2, after a go-ahead shot by Richard Jefferson with 8 seconds left in Game 6 led to a 98–97 victory.  Seven years later , the two teams would meet once again in the First Round, where the series would end in Game 7, after a game-winning block by Paul Pierce , giving the Nets the 104–103 victory.  The series was also noted for controversy when Toronto Raptor's General Manager Masai Ujiri made derogatory remarks towards Brooklyn at a fan rally outside Maple Leaf Square before Game 1. Ujiri later apologized at halftime.  , The mascot of the New Jersey Nets was Sly the Silver Fox , who debuted on October 31, 1997 as part of the rebranding of the Nets for the 1997–98 season .  Prior to that, the Nets' mascot was an anthropomorphic dragon named Duncan the Dragon .  , The Nets introduced a new super hero mascot for their move to Brooklyn named BrooklyKnight (a play on the demonym Brooklynite) on November 3, 2012 – he was lowered from the ceiling of the Barclays Center amid sparks and fanfare and introduced by Nets PA announcer David Diamante: "Here to defend Brooklyn, he's the BrooklyKnight." The mascot was co-created by Marvel Entertainment , a sister company to NBA broadcasters ABC and ESPN . A 32-page comic book titled BrooklyKnight #1 , written by Jason Aaron and drawn by Mike Deodato Jr. , was released by Marvel to commemorate the unveiling of the mascot.  After the Nets' second season in Brooklyn, the franchise decided to discontinue the BrooklyKnight mascot.  , On November 3, 2012, the Nets introduced a new team anthem titled "Brooklyn: Something To Lean On", written and recorded by Brooklyn-born musician John Forté .  The song is notable for its refrain, which features the "Brooklyn" chant that has been popular with fans in Barclays Center.  , The Nets' front office in 2013 included Mikhail Prokhorov (Principal Owner), Brett Yormark (CEO, Brooklyn Nets), Billy King (General Manager), and Jeff Gewirtz (Executive Vice President, Business Affairs & Chief Legal Officer).  , The original owner of the Nets franchise was trucking magnate Arthur J. Brown, who was the founder of the American Basketball Association team that was then known as the New Jersey Americans in 1967. The next year, Brown renamed the franchise to the New York Nets following a move to Long Island, and sold the team for $1.1 million to entrepreneur Roy Boe .  Due to financial losses suffered while the team was in Long Island, Boe moved the team back to New Jersey in 1977 and sold the team a year later to a group of seven local businessmen led by Alan N. Cohen and Joseph Taub, who became known as the " Secaucus Seven".  , After a lengthy ownership of the franchise and numerous attempts to improve the financial situation of the team, the "Secaucus Seven" finally sold the team in 1998 to a group of local real estate developers led by Raymond Chambers and Lewis Katz ,  who called themselves the "Community Youth Organization" (CYO) and wanted to move the team to Newark, New Jersey . The next year the group signed an agreement with New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner to form YankeeNets , a holding company that would own the two teams, and later also the New Jersey Devils , and increase leverage in future broadcast contracts by negotiating together. After receiving offers from numerous broadcast partners, including what was then their current rights holder Cablevision , YankeeNets decided to launch its own regional sports television called the YES Network . , YankeeNets would ultimately fail in its attempts to secure a deal with Newark to construct a new arena in the city. By that point in time, tensions between the management of the Yankees, Nets, and the Devils had cause a rift between them, and a decision was made to split the group up.  With their plan to move the Nets now dead, the CYO placed the team on sale. After a short bidding process, the group secured a deal with real estate developer Bruce Ratner to buy the team for $300 million, defeating a similar offer by Charles Kushner and Senator Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey. Ratner had purchased the team with the intent of moving it to a new arena in Brooklyn , which was to be a centerpiece of the large-scale Atlantic Yards development.  , On September 24, 2009, Mikhail Prokhorov , Russia's third-richest man according to Forbes , confirmed his intention to become majority owner of the Nets. Prokhorov sent an offer to the team owners requesting that the control shareholding of the basketball club be sold to his company, Onexim, for a symbolic price. In return, Prokhorov would fund a loan for the construction of a $700 million arena in Brooklyn and attract additional funds from Western banks. Prokhorov stated that he initiated the deal to help push Russian basketball to a new level of development.  On May 11, 2010, following approval from the other owners of the NBA, Prokhorov had become a principal owner of the Nets.  , The Nets' training center, and the headquarters for the team's basketball operations, have been located at the 65,000-square-foot PNY Center in East Rutherford, NJ, since 1998.  Prior to that, the team had practiced at the APA Recreation Center in North Bergen , NJ, sharing their lockers and practice courts with truck drivers who used the facility.  In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in November 2012, PNY Center suffered power outage and extensive water damage due to flooding, and for several months, the team used the smaller training spaces and practice courts inside the Barclays Center instead.  , On June 26, 2014, the Nets announced their intention to move their training center to the Industry City complex in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn. The new facility, to be known as the Hospital for Special Surgery Training Center (HSS Center), will be built on the roof of an empty warehouse in the complex, occupying 70,000 square feet of space in total. The renovation project will cost roughly $50 million.  , The Nets hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who isn't signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.  This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. , Bold denotes still active with team. Italics denotes still active but not with team.

This made the Nets the second team to opt for a D-League "hybrid affiliation", the first being the Houston Rockets with the Rio Grande Valley Vipers . Springfield ownership had maintained control over business, marketing, and day-to-day operations; however, the Brooklyn Nets had control over coaching and player decisions. This hybrid model was well received by GMs and owners.  However, after three seasons, the Pistons had purchased the Armor from the Nets, moving and renaming the team as the Grand Rapids Drive .  , The television home of the Nets is currently the YES Network , which the team helped create while they were under the corporate umbrella of YankeeNets LLC , a merger of business operations between the Nets and the New York Yankees . After the dissolution of YankeeNets and Bruce Ratner's purchase of the team, YES signed a long-term deal to keep broadcasting Nets games. The sale to the Ratner group did not include the percentage of YES that was previously owned by the Nets, which remains with the pre-merger Nets owners. Prior to that, the Nets' TV home was Fox Sports Net New York and SportsChannel New York . , The team's local broadcast partner is WWOR-TV , and games have aired on WLNY in the past as well. , The current flagship radio station of the Nets is WFAN , which took over the radio rights to the Nets after losing their basketball contract with the Knicks (who moved to WEPN ). Prior to that, Nets games aired on WNEW , WMCA , WVNJ , WNBC , WQEW , and WOR . , In the club's early ABA years, some Sunday road games were televised in a package carried by WPIX-TV . The team's later ABA tenure featured more frequent road telecasts on their current broadcast partner, WWOR-TV. Known then as WOR-TV, it continued airing road games for a time once the team joined the NBA in 1976. , Ian Eagle has television duties for the Nets after the departure of Marv Albert in 2011. Eagle became the lead television voice for the team in 1995 after serving as the team's radio voice for one year, while Albert joined the Nets following his firing by MSG Network in 2005 after four decades as the lead voice of the New York Knicks . When Albert joined the broadcast team, he became the lead broadcaster with Eagle as his substitute; beginning in the 2009–10 season, due to Albert's advancing age and his other commitments, Eagle once again assumed the lead play-by-play spot. As of the 2011–12 season, Eagle is the sole lead announcer after Albert decided to move to CBS Sports for both NFL and NCAA basketball , in addition to his work on the NBA on TNT . Ryan Ruocco substitutes for Eagle during the latter's CBS NFL and NCAA commitments. , Joining Eagle in the booth for 2013 are former NBA player and ex-Net Donny Marshall and longtime Nets analyst Jim Spanarkel . Marshall replaced Mike Fratello as the lead analyst following the 2012–13 season and Spanarkel shares duties with him as he has in the past with other announcers. , WFAN is the Nets' current radio flagship, the station having assumed radio rights from WOR following the 2003–04 season. Chris Carrino and Tim Capstraw comprise the broadcast team, Carrino on play-by-play and Capstraw as the analyst. , Other broadcasters who have worked for the Nets include Howard David , Bob Papa , Bill Raftery , Kelly Tripucka , Albert King , Mike O'Koren, Spencer Ross , Mel Proctor , Joe Tait , John Sterling , Mike DiTomasso , WFAN update man John Minko and Mark Jackson . , Nets games have also aired on WNEW-AM and WQEW in the past. , During the club's ABA years, announcers included Marty Glickman , Marv Albert's brothers Al Albert and Steve Albert , baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Bob Gibson , Bob Goldsholl, as well as Sterling and DiTomasso. The latter two joined the club's move into the NBA.  The Philadelphia 76ers (also commonly known as the Sixers ) are an American professional basketball team based in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . They play in the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Founded in 1946 and originally known as the Syracuse Nationals , they are one of the oldest franchises in the NBA, and one of only eight (out of 23) to survive the league's first decade. , The 76ers have had a rich history, with many of the greatest players in NBA history having played for the organization, including Wilt Chamberlain , Julius Erving , Moses Malone , Charles Barkley , Allen Iverson , and Dikembe Mutombo . They have won three NBA championships, with their first coming as the Syracuse Nationals in 1955. The second title came in the 1966–67 season , a team which was led by Chamberlain. The third title came in the 1982–83 season , won by a team led by Erving and Malone. They have only been back to the Finals once since then, during the 2001 campaign , led by Iverson and Mutombo, only to fall to the Los Angeles Lakers , 4–1. They won game 1 in overtime, but lost the next 4. The Sixers set a franchise record and tied an NBA record for futility during the 2013–14 season , losing 26 consecutive games. , , , In 1946, Italian immigrant Daniel Biasone sent a $5,000 check to the National Basketball League offices in Chicago , and the Syracuse Nationals became the largely Midwest-based league's easternmost team, based in the Upstate New York city of Syracuse .  The Syracuse Nationals began play in the NBL in the same year professional basketball was finally gaining some legitimacy with the rival Basketball Association of America that was based in large cities like New York and Philadelphia. While in the NBL with teams largely consisting of small Midwestern towns, the Nationals put together a 21–23 record, finishing in 4th place. In the playoffs, the Nats would be beaten by the fellow upstate neighbor Rochester Royals in 4 games. , In their second season, 1947–48, the Nationals would struggle, finishing in 5th place with a 24-36 record. Despite their struggles, the Nats would make the playoffs, getting swept by the Anderson Duffey Packers in 3 straight games. , Several teams began to leave the NBL for the BAA as the foundation for an absorption was laid. Staying in the NBL, the Nationals signed Al Cervi to be player coach as Dolph Schayes made his professional debut, leading the Nats to a winning record for the first time with a record of 41–22. In the playoffs the Nationals would make quick work of the Hammond Calumet Buccaneers, winning the series in 2 straight games. However, in the semifinals the Nats would fall to the Anderson Duffey Packers for the second straight season in 4 games. In 1949, the Nationals were one of seven NBL teams that were absorbed by the Basketball Association of America to form the NBA. , The Nationals were an instant success in the NBA winning the Eastern Division in the 1949-1950 season, with a league best record of 51–13 . In the playoffs the Nationals would continue to play solid basketball beating the Philadelphia Warriors in 2 straight. Moving on to the Eastern Finals the Nationals would battle the New York Knickerbockers beating their big city rivals in a 3-game series. Moving on to the NBA Finals the Nationals would face fellow NBL alum Minneapolis Lakers . In Game 1 of the Finals the Nats would lose just their 2nd home game of the season 68–66. The Nats would not recover as they fell behind 3 games to 1 before falling in 6 games. , Despite several teams leaving the NBA for the National Professional Basketball League , before the 1950-1951 season, the Nationals decided to stay put. In their second NBA season the Nationals played mediocre basketball all season finishing in 4th place with a record of 32–34. However, in the playoffs the Nats played their best basketball of the season as they stunned the 1st place Philadelphia Warriors in 2 straight taking Game 1 on the road in overtime 91–89. However, in the Eastern Finals the Nationals would be beaten by the New York Knickerbockers in a hard fought 5-game series losing the finale by just 2 points. , Al Cervi, playing less and coaching more, emphasized a patient offense and a scrappy defense, which led the league by yielding a stingy 79.5 points per game, as the Nationals won the Eastern Division in the 1951-1952 season, with a solid 40–26 record. In the playoffs the Nats would knock the Philadelphia Warriors off again in a 3-game series. However, in the Eastern Finals the Nats would fall to the New York Knickerbockers again dropping the series in 4 games. , The Nationals would finish in 2nd place in a hard fought 3-way battle for first place in the Eastern Division for the 1952-1953 season, with a record of 47–24. In the playoffs the Nationals would face the Boston Celtics dropping Game 1 at home 87–81. Needing a win in Boston to keep their hopes alive, the Nationals would take the Celtics deep in to overtime before losing in quadruple OT 111–105, in what remains the longest playoff game in NBA history.  , The Nationals acquired Alex Groza , and Ralph Beard as the Indianapolis Olympians folded leaving the NBA with just 9 teams for the 1953-1954 season. Once again the Nationals would battle for the Division title falling 2 games short with a 42–30 record. In the playoffs the Nats would win all 4 games of a round robin tournament involving the 3 playoff teams from the East. In the Eastern Finals the Nats would stay hot beating the Boston Celtics in 2 straight games. However, in the NBA Finals the Nationals would lose to the Minneapolis Lakers in a hard fought 7-game series where the 2 teams alternated wins throughout. , With the NBA struggling financially and down to just 8 teams Nationals owner during the 1954-1955 season Danny Biasone suggested the league limit the amount of time taken for a shot thus speeding up a game that often ended with long periods of teams just holding the ball and playing keep away. Biasone calculated a 24-second shot clock would allow at least 30 shots per quarter speeding up the game and increasing scoring. The Shot Clock was an instant success as scoring was up 14 points per game league wide. In the first season of the shot clock the Nats would take first place in the East with a 43–29 record. After a first round bye the Nats would beat the Boston Celtics in 4 games to reach the NBA Finals for the 2nd straight season. In the finals the Nats would get off to a fast start, lead by (led by forward Dolph Schayes ), and took the first 2 games at home against the Fort Wayne Pistons .  However, as the series moved to Fort Wayne the Pistons would spark back to life taking all 3 games to take a 3–2 series lead. Back in Syracuse for Game 6 on the Nats kept Championship hopes alive by beating the Pistons 109-104 to force a 7th game at home. Game 7 would be as tight as the series as George King sank a free throw to give the Nats a 92–91 lead in the final seconds. King would then steal inbound pass to clinch the NBA Championship for the Nationals. , Coming off their NBA Championship the Nationals struggled during the 1955-1956 season, needing a tiebreaker over the New York Knickerbockers to avoid finishing in last place and make the playoffs with a 35–37 record. However, in the playoffs the Nats would stun the Boston Celtics winning the first round series in 3 games by taking the final 2 games. In the Eastern Finals the Nationals played solid basketball again as they pushed the Philadelphia Warriors to a decisive 5th game. However, the Nationals' reign as champions would end with a 109–104 loss in Philadelphia . , The Nationals would get off to a slow start as coach Al Cervi was fired and replaced by Paul Seymour . Under Seymour the Nats would rebound and finish the 1956-1957 season in 2nd place with a record of 38–34. In the playoffs the Nats would have trouble knocking off the defending champion Philadelphia Warriors advancing to the Eastern Finals with 2 straight wins. However, the Nats would be swept in 3 straight games by the eventual champions, the Boston Celtics . , Fort Wayne and Rochester had moved on to Detroit and Cincinnati for the 1957-1958 season, leaving the Syracuse Nationals as the last small town team in the big city NBA. That would not matter on the court as the Nats held their own finishing in 2nd place with a 41–31 record. However, in the playoffs the Nationals would fall in the first round as they lost a 3-game series to the Philadelphia Warriors. , Despite a mediocre 35–37 record for the 1958-1959 season the Nationals would make the playoffs again by finishing in 3rd place. In the playoffs the Nationals would once again rise to the occasion sweeping the New York Knickerbockers in 2 straight to reach the Eastern Finals, where they gave the eventual champion Boston Celtics all they could handle, alternating wins before falling by 5 points in Game 7. , Playing in a league now dominated by superstars like Bill Russell of the Boston Celtics , Wilt Chamberlain of the Philadelphia Warriors and Bob Pettit of the St. Louis Hawks , the Nationals held their own posting a solid 45–30 record, while finishing in 3rd place after the 1959-1960 regular season. However, in the playoffs the Nats would lose a 3-game series to Chamberlain and the Warriors. , With the Lakers relocating from Minneapolis to Los Angeles before the 1960-1961 season, the Syracuse Nationals became the last old NBL team to still be playing in their original city in the NBA. The Nationals would go on to make the playoffs again by finishing in 3rd place with a 38–41 record. The Nationals would prove to be dangerous in the playoffs as they stunned the Philadelphia Warriors in 3 straight games. However, in the Eastern Finals the Nats would be knocked off once again by the eventual champion Boston Celtics in 5 games. , Dolph Schayes missed 24 games during the 1961-1962 season and fails to lead the team in scoring for the first time in 14 years, as Hal Greer leads the way with 22.8 ppg. The Nats would go on to finish in 3rd place again with a 41–39 record. In the playoffs the Nats would drop their first 2 games to the Philadelphia Warriors on the road. Facing elimination the Nats would win the next 2 games to force a 7th game in Philadelphia. However, in Game 5 the Warriors would prove to be too strong as they ended the Nats season with a 121–104 victory. , With an aging team the Nationals were expected to fade, however with the scrappy play of Johnny Kerr the Nationals remained a strong contender finishing in 2nd place for the 1962-1963 season, with a record of 48–32. In the playoffs the Nationals would face the Cincinnati Royals , getting off to a 2–1 series lead. However, needing a win to advance to the Eastern Finals again the Nationals would lose 2 straight dropping the decisive 5th game at home in overtime 131–127. , The playoff overtime loss on March 26, 1963 would prove to be the last game for the Syracuse Nationals, as investors Irv Kosloff and Ike Richman purchased the team from Danny Biasone moving the team to Philadelphia, filling the void left by the Warriors. Syracuse was the last of the medium-sized cities housing an NBA team, but by then it was apparent that central New York was no longer large enough to support it. The NBA thus returned to Philadelphia one year after the Warriors had left for San Francisco . A contest was held to decide on a new name for the team. The winning name, chosen by Walter Stalberg, was the "76ers".   Newspaper writers liked the name because it was easily shortened to "Sixers" in headlines. The shorter name was quickly accepted by the team for marketing purposes, and for most of the last half-century "76ers" and "Sixers" have been officially interchangeable. , For their first four years in Philadelphia, the 76ers played mostly at the Philadelphia Arena and Civic Center-Convention Hall , with an occasional game at The Palestra at the University of Pennsylvania . Schayes was named head coach, a post he held for four years (the first as player-coach). , In June 2014 the it was announced that the team would move their practice facility and home offices to the Camden Waterfront , across the Delaware River from Philadelphia in Camden, New Jersey .   , In the 1964–65 season, the 76ers acquired the legendary Wilt Chamberlain from the Warriors; Chamberlain had been a high school legend at Overbrook High School in Philadelphia and began his career with the Warriors while they still played in Philadelphia. The 76ers would push the Celtics to seven games in the semifinals, with the 76ers trailing 110–109 in Game 7. After Hal Greer 's pass was stolen by John Havlicek —an infamous blow to 76ers fans, rubbed in by fabled Celtics announcer Johnny Most when he yelled into the microphone "Havlicek stole the ball!"—the Celtics went on to beat the Los Angeles Lakers and win the NBA Championship. On December 3, 1965, in the midst of a game at the Boston Garden, co-owner Ike Richman suffered a heart attack and died courtside.  , Led by head coach Alex Hannum , the 76ers had a dream season as they started 46–4,  en route to a record of 68–13, the best record in league history at the time.  Chamberlain, Billy Cunningham , and Hal Greer , along with all-stars Chet Walker , Lucious Jackson and Wali Jones led the team to the semifinals. This time the 76ers beat the Celtics in five games. In Game Five of that series, as the 76ers went to victory and the NBA Finals, Philadelphia fans chanted "Boston is dead!"—a symbol that the Celts' eight-year reign as NBA champion had ended. The Finals were almost anticlimactic, with the Sixers ousting the Warriors in six games to give them their second NBA Championship. The 1966–67 Sixers were voted the best team in league history during the NBA's 35th anniversary celebration. Since then, the record for regular season wins has been broken twice, by the 1971-72 Los Angeles Lakers (69) and 1995-96 Chicago Bulls (72), both of whom also won championships in their respective seasons. Other than those two teams, the only other team in league history to post a better regular season record than the 1966-67 Philadelphia 76ers were the 1996-97 Chicago Bulls (69). , In the 1967–68 season, with a new home court in the form of The Spectrum to defend their championship, once again the 76ers made it back to the NBA Playoffs and in the rematch of the previous year's semifinals, the 76ers held a 3–1 series lead over the Celtics, before the Celtics staged a dramatic comeback to beat the Sixers in seven games. , At the end of the season, the 76ers dealt Chamberlain to the Los Angeles Lakers for Archie Clark, Darrall Imhoff and Jerry Chambers. At the time, the trade appeared to make some sense from the Sixers' perspective. Chamberlain was making noises about jumping to the American Basketball Association , and GM Jack Ramsay didn't want to risk letting Chamberlain walk away for nothing. Nonetheless, the Sixers didn't get nearly enough in return. The man who was in position to take over as the center, Lucious Jackson, suffered a severe injury in 1969 and was never the same player after that. The Chamberlain trade sent the Sixers into a freefall, which Ramsay accelerated by subsequent divestiture of All Star forward Chet Walker to the Chicago Bulls . , While the rapidly declining 76ers continued to contend for the next three seasons, they never got past the second round. In 1971–72—only five years after winning the title—the 76ers finished 30–52 and missed postseason play for the first time in franchise history. , The bottom fell out in the 1972–73 season. For all intents and purposes, the season ended when Cunningham bolted to the ABA, leaving the Sixers with a roster of Greer and little else. The 76ers lost their first 15 games of the season, and a few months later set a then-record 20-game losing streak in a single season. Their record following the 20-game losing streak was 4–58, and the team at that point had just lost 34 of 35 games. The 76ers finished the season with a 9–73 record, leading the skeptical Philadelphia press to call them the "Nine and 73-ers". Under Coach Roy Rubin the 76ers went 4-47. It was his first and, as it turned out, his last NBA coaching job. He was succeeded by player-coach Kevin Loughery, who went 5-26 the rest of the way. The 76ers finished an NBA-record 59 games behind the Atlantic Division champion Boston Celtics. The nine wins by the 1972–73 squad is the fourth fewest in NBA history, and remains the fewest for a full 82 game season. The 73 losses, although threatened several times, remains the all-time low-water mark for any NBA franchise. The 76ers' 0.110 winning percentage was a record worst at the time, and is still the second lowest in NBA history. This record was broken by the 2011-2012 Charlotte Bobcats which was shortened due to a lockout. (That Bobcats team finished 7-59, for a .106 winning percentage.) Only six seasons earlier, the 76ers had set the NBA record for most wins in a season. The 76ers of 1972-73 is considered to be the worst team that ever played in NBA history. , The next year, the 76ers would hire Gene Shue as their head coach and they slowly came back. In the 1975–76 season, the 76ers acquired George McGinnis from the Indiana Pacers of the ABA (after the Knicks tried to sign him, not knowing that the 76ers owned his rights). With him, the 76ers were back in the playoffs after a five-year absence, and even though they lost to the Buffalo Braves in three games, a "Doctor" would come along and get the team healthy enough to stay in perennial contention. During this period, however, one last personnel misjudgment had effects when the team used the fifth pick overall in the 1975 draft to select Darryl Dawkins directly from high school. The immensely talented and physically imposing Dawkins seldom, if ever, lived up to his great potential in part because of a perpetual adolescence. , The Sixers finally came all the way back in 1976-77, in large part due to a byproduct of the ABA-NBA merger . The ABA's last champions, the New York Nets , were facing having to pay almost $5 million to the Knicks for "invading" the New York area on top of the $3.2 million expansion fee for joining the NBA. When the Sixers offered to buy the contract of the Nets' franchise player, Julius Erving , for $3 million—roughly the cost of NBA membership—the Nets had little choice but to accept. A few months before that trade, Kosloff had sold the Sixers to local philanthropist Fitz Eugene Dixon, Jr. , grandson of George Dunton Widener and heir to the Widener fortune. , Led by Erving, the 76ers began an exciting ride for the fans of Philadelphia, beating their long-time rival from Boston in a seven-game playoff to advance to the Eastern Conference Finals. There, they defeated the Houston Rockets , led by future 76er Moses Malone , in six games to advance to the NBA Finals. In the Finals, they sprinted to a 2-0 series lead over the Bill Walton -led Portland Trail Blazers —who were coached by former Sixers coach/general manager Jack Ramsay—only to drop the next four games in a row to give the Blazers the title. , That led to the 1977–78 motto of "We owe you one", which would ultimately backfire when they lost in the conference finals that season to the Washington Bullets , who went on to win the NBA championship. In the next four seasons, the 76ers would fall short of the NBA Championship, even after Shue handed the coaching reins to former great Billy Cunningham. In the 1980 NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers , they lost, four games to two. In Game Six, rookie Magic Johnson played center for the Lakers in place of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (who was out because of a sprained ankle sustained in Game Five) and scored 42 points. In the 1981 Eastern Conference Finals, the 76ers opened a 3–1 series lead over the Celtics only to see Boston come back and win the series in seven games. The following season, the 76ers again faced the Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals, and again jumped to a 3–1 series lead only to see Boston forge a 3–3 series tie. The 76ers were given little chance of winning as they faced the Celtics in Game Seven at Boston Garden . This time, they played angry but inspired basketball, pulling away to a 120–106 victory. In the game's closing moments, the Boston Garden fans began chanting "Beat L.A., Beat L.A." , an incredible moment in basketball history, wherein, for seemingly the first time ever the opposing team's fans (Boston), realizing their team would lose the playoff series to a hated opponent (Philadelphia), nonetheless during the very game their team (Boston) was losing to the opponent (Philadelphia), openly wished that opponent (Philadelphia) good luck in the next round against a more hated opponent (Los Angeles).  Although they lost in the NBA Finals, the 76ers began the 1982–83 season with great momentum. All they needed now was Moses to lead them to the promised land of the NBA championship. , Harold Katz bought the 76ers from Dixon in 1981. On his watch, the final piece of the championship puzzle was completed before the 1982–83 season when they acquired center Moses Malone from the Houston Rockets . Led by Hall of Famer Julius Erving and All-Stars Maurice Cheeks , Andrew Toney , and Bobby Jones they dominated the regular season, winning 65 games in what is still the second most winning year in franchise history. Malone was named League MVP, and when reporters asked how the playoffs would run, he answered, "four, four, four"—in other words, saying that the 76ers needed to win four games in each of the 3 rounds. The media misinterpreted this and assumed Moses was predicting that the 76ers would sweep all three rounds to win the title, with the minimum 12 games. Malone's accent made his boast sound like "fo', fo', fo'." , However, the 76ers backed up Malone's boast. They made a mockery of the Eastern Conference playoffs, first sweeping the New York Knicks and then beating the Milwaukee Bucks in five games. The 76ers went on to win their third NBA championship (and second in Philadelphia) with a four-game sweep of the Los Angeles Lakers, who had defeated them the season before. Malone was named the playoffs' MVP. The 76ers didn't quite fulfill Malone's prediction, as their run was actually "fo', fi', fo" ("four, five, four")--a loss to the Bucks in game four of the Eastern finals being the only blemish on their playoff run. Nonetheless, their 12–1 playoff record is tied for the least number of losses in league history with the 2000–2001 Lakers, who went 15–1 en route to the NBA Title, coincidentally beating the 76ers in the Finals (after suffering their only defeat that postseason in Game 1). The Philadelphia-based group Pieces Of A Dream had a minor hit in 1983 with the R&B song "Fo-Fi-Fo", which title was prompted by Malone's quip. This also marked the last championship in Philadelphia until the Phillies won the 2008 World Series .  , After a disappointing 1983–84 season , which ended with a five-game loss to the upstart New Jersey Nets in the first round of the playoffs , Charles Barkley arrived in Philadelphia for the 1984–85 season . For the next eight seasons, Barkley brought delight to the Philadelphia fans thanks to his humorous and sometimes controversial ways.  The Sixers returned to the Eastern Conference Finals in Barkley's rookie season, but lost to the Boston Celtics in five games. As it turned out, they would never again advance as far during Barkley's tenure in Philadelphia. Following the '84-85 season, Matt Guokas replaced Billy Cunningham as head coach. Guokas led the 76ers to a 54-28 record and the second round of the playoffs in 1985–86 , where they were defeated by the Milwaukee Bucks in seven games. , On June 16, 1986, Katz made two of the most controversial and highly criticized personnel moves in franchise history, trading Moses Malone to Washington and the first overall pick in the 1986 NBA Draft (which had been obtained from the San Diego Clippers in a 1979 trade for Joe Bryant ) to the Cleveland Cavaliers . In return, the 76ers received Roy Hinson , Jeff Ruland , and Cliff Robinson , none of whom played more than three seasons with the team. Cleveland, meanwhile, turned their acquired pick into future All-Star Brad Daugherty . , On the night of the 1986–87 season opener, Julius Erving announced he would retire after the season, which was subsequently filled with tributes in each arena the Sixers visited. On the court, the team suffered through an injury-plagued campaign, but still managed to make the playoffs with a 45-37 record. Their season would end at the hands of the Bucks again, this time in a best-of-five first round series that went the distance. , In 1987–88 , with the team's record at 20–23, Guokas was fired and replaced by assistant Jim Lynam . Lynam finished the season 16–23, to bring Philadelphia's overall mark to 36-46. For the first time since the 1974-75 season, the Sixers failed to reach the playoffs. Philadelphia selected Charles Smith with its first pick (third overall) in the 1988 NBA Draft , then traded his rights to the Los Angeles Clippers for their first pick (sixth overall), Hersey Hawkins . In five seasons with the 76ers, Hawkins would average 19 points per game, and was the team's all-time leader in three-point field goals attempted and made when he was traded to the Charlotte Hornets for Dana Barros , Sidney Green and draft picks in 1993. , In 1988–89, Philadelphia returned to the playoffs after a one-year absence, but were swept in the first round by the New York Knicks . In 1989–90, Barkley finished second in the league's MVP voting, as the Sixers won the Atlantic Division title with a 53-29 record. After defeating Cleveland in the first round of the playoffs, Philadelphia faced Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls in the second round. The 76ers fell to the Chicago Bulls in five games, and would do the same in 1991 after sweeping the Bucks in the first round. In 1991–92 , the 76ers went 35-47 and missed the playoffs for the just the second time during Barkley's eight seasons in Philadelphia. On June 17, 1992, Barkley was traded to the Phoenix Suns for Jeff Hornacek , Tim Perry , and Andrew Lang , a deal that was met with harsh criticism.  , Lynam relinquished his head coaching position to become general manager following the 1991–92 season, and hired Doug Moe to fill the vacancy. Moe's tenure lasted just 56 games, with the Sixers posting a 19–37 record. Popular former player and longtime assistant coach Fred Carter succeeded Moe as head coach in March 1993, but could only manage a 32–76 record at the helm. Following the 1993–94 season, the 76ers hired John Lucas in the dual role of head coach and general manager. The enthusiastic Lucas had been successful as a head coach for the San Antonio Spurs , and Philadelphia hoped he could breathe new life into the 76ers. It proved disastrous, as the team went 42–122 in its two seasons under Lucas. The acquisition of unproductive free agents such as Scott Williams and Charles Shackleford , players at the end of their careers such as LaSalle Thompson , Orlando Woolridge , and Scott Skiles along with stunningly unwise high draft picks such as Shawn Bradley and Sharone Wright were also factors in the team's decline. In fact, Wright would only play four seasons in the NBA while Temple product Eddie Jones —drafted 4 slots below Wright in 1994 by the L.A. Lakers—had 16 productive seasons as an NBA player. , Starting with the 1990–91 season, and ending with the 1995–96 season, the 76ers had the dubious distinction of seeing their win total decrease each year. The nadir was the 1995–96 season, when they finished with an 18–64 record, the second-worst in franchise history. It was also the second-worst record in the league that year, ahead of only the expansion Vancouver Grizzlies but behind the Toronto Raptors , who were also in their inaugural season. That season would turn out to be their last in The Spectrum . Katz, unpopular among fans since the 1986 trades, sold the team to Comcast Spectacor , a consortium of Philadelphia Flyers owner Ed Snider and Comcast Corporation , at the end of the 1995–96 season. Snider had been the Sixers' landlord since gaining control of the Spectrum in 1971. Pat Croce , a former trainer for the Flyers and Sixers, took over as president. , Many 76ers fans call these years "The Dark Ages". However, after many years of misfortune, there was a bright spot. The team won the lottery for the top pick in the 1996 NBA Draft . Questions remained, but with the first pick, the Sixers found their "Answer": Allen Iverson . , With new ownership, Iverson in place, and the 76ers moving into the CoreStates Center , things seemed to finally be heading in a positive direction. Croce fired Lucas as both coach and general manager. Johnny Davis was named head coach, while Brad Greenberg took over as general manager. Iverson was named Rookie of the Year, but Philadelphia's overall improvement was minimal, as they finished with a 22–60 record. Changes had to be made, and after the 1996–97 season, Davis and Greenberg were both fired and the unveiling of a new 76ers team logo and jerseys marked a new era. To replace Davis, Larry Brown was hired as head coach. Known for a defense-first approach and transforming unsuccessful teams into winners by "playing the right way", Brown faced perhaps his toughest coaching challenge. He often clashed with Iverson, but the 76ers improved to 31 wins in 1997–98. Early in the 1997–98 season, the Sixers traded Jerry Stackhouse , who had been the third overall pick in the 1995 NBA Draft , to the Detroit Pistons . In exchange, Philadelphia received Aaron McKie and Theo Ratliff , defensive standouts who would have an impact in the team's resurgence. Another key figure in the team's rise, Eric Snow , was added in a trade with the Seattle SuperSonics in January 1998. , Prior to the 1998–99 season, the 76ers signed George Lynch and Matt Geiger , but a lengthy lockout delayed the start of the season, which was shortened to 50 games. During the season, Philadelphia acquired Tyrone Hill in a trade with Milwaukee. The team began its resurgence during this strike-shortened season, finishing with a 28–22 record and the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs, marking the first time since 1991 the team reached the postseason. In the first round, Philadelphia upset the Orlando Magic , three games to one, before being swept by the Indiana Pacers . The following season, the Sixers improved to 49–33, fifth in the East. Again, the Sixers won their first round series in four games, this time defeating the Charlotte Hornets . For the second straight year, they were defeated by Indiana in the second round, this time in six games. Though the team was moving in a positive direction, Iverson and Brown continued to clash, and their relationship deteriorated to the point where it seemed certain Iverson would be traded. A rumored trade to the Los Angeles Clippers fell through, but a complicated four-team deal that would've seen Iverson sent to Detroit was agreed upon, only to see it dissolve due to salary cap problems. When it became clear Iverson was staying in Philadelphia, he and Brown worked to patch things up, and the team would reap the benefits in 2000–01. , During the 2000–01 season, the 76ers got off to a hot start by winning their first ten games and were never seriously challenged in the Atlantic Division. Larry Brown coached the Eastern Conference All-Stars, and Allen Iverson was named MVP of the All-Star Game. Shortly before the All-Star break, Theo Ratliff was lost for the season with a wrist injury, one that would later prove to be devastating to his future career. Despite holding a 41-14 record and a comfortable lead atop both the Atlantic Division and Eastern Conference standings at the time of the February 22 trade deadline, management felt the team needed an established center to advance deep into the playoffs. On that day, Philadelphia acquired Dikembe Mutombo from the Atlanta Hawks in a deal that sent the injured Ratliff along with Nazr Mohammed , Toni Kukoč , and Pepe Sanchez to Atlanta (Sanchez was reacquired later in the season after the Hawks waived him). The 76ers went on to finish 56-26, good enough for their first Atlantic Division title since 1989–90 and top seed in the Eastern Conference Playoffs. , In the first round of the playoffs, Philadelphia faced Indiana yet again. In Game One, the 76ers wasted an 18-point lead and lost, 79–78, when Reggie Miller hit a three-pointer in the closing seconds. Philadelphia fought back, however, and took the next three games to win the series. In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Sixers squared off against the Toronto Raptors and their superstar, Vince Carter . The teams alternated wins in the first four games, with Iverson scoring 54 points in Philadelphia's Game Two victory. A Game Five win (with Iverson scoring 52 in a 121-88 rout) and Game Six loss set up a decisive Game Seven, which the 76ers survived as Carter missed a long jump shot at the buzzer for an 88-87 victory that sent the Sixers to the Eastern Conference Finals against the Milwaukee Bucks. After the teams split the first two games of the series in Philadelphia, it was learned Iverson would miss Game Three due to various nagging injuries that had plagued him late in the season. Though most predicted a Milwaukee cakewalk, the 76ers kept the game close before falling, 80–74. Philadelphia seemed to gain momentum despite the loss, and they would win Games Four and Five. Milwaukee put any Sixer celebration plans on hold by building up a 33-point lead in the third quarter of Game Six, but the 76ers would make a furious fourth-quarter rally before falling 110–100. Struggling in the series up to that point, Iverson scored 26 points in the final quarter to finish with 46 on the night and appeared to have gotten a second wind. In Game Seven, the Bucks jumped out to a 34–25 second quarter advantage before seldom-used reserve Raja Bell scored 10 points to spark a 23–4 run that gave Philadelphia the lead for good. Iverson scored 44 points and the 76ers pulled away in the second half, winning by a 108–91 score to put them in the NBA Finals for the first time since 1983. As had been the case in their three previous Finals appearances, their opponent would be the Los Angeles Lakers, who had run up an 11–0 record in the first three rounds of the playoffs and were expected by many to make quick work of a worn-down 76ers squad. Because of a seemingly meaningless loss to the lowly Chicago Bulls in the regular season finale (both the Sixers and the Lakers finished with identical 56–26 records, but Los Angeles was awarded a higher seed based on tiebreakers), the NBA Finals marked the first time in the 2001 playoffs in which the 76ers had to start a series on the road. , In Game One, the Lakers jumped out to an 18–5 lead, but the 76ers stormed back to take a 15-point lead in the second half. Los Angeles rallied to force a 94–94 tie at the end of regulation before scoring the first five points of the overtime period, but the 76ers closed the game on a 13-2 run for a 107-101 triumph. Iverson hit a go-ahead three-pointer with 1:19 to go in the extra period, and followed that with a jump shot after which he infamously stepped over Tyronn Lue after making the basket. Eric Snow hit a running jump shot in the waning seconds with the shot clock expiring to clinch the stunning victory. The series would come back to Philadelphia even as Los Angeles took Game Two, 98–89. In Game Three, Shaquille O'Neal fouled out late in the fourth quarter, and the Sixers pulled to within a point with less than a minute to play after trailing by 12 earlier in the second half. Robert Horry , however, hit a clutch three-pointer in that final minute, and the Lakers prevailed, 96-91. Los Angeles wrapped up the second of what would be three consecutive NBA titles with a 100–86 win in Game Four and a 108–96 victory in Game Five. , In addition to their Atlantic Division and Eastern Conference titles, the 2000–01 76ers featured the NBA's MVP (Iverson), Coach of the Year (Brown), Defensive Player of the Year (Mutombo), and Sixth Man of the Year ( Aaron McKie ). , The 76ers went into the 2001–02 season with high expectations, but were able to produce only a 43–39 record, sixth in the Eastern Conference. In the first round of the playoffs, Philadelphia was defeated by the Boston Celtics, three games to two. In 2002–03, the 76ers sprinted to a 15–4 start, but a 10–20 swoon left them 25–24 at the All-Star break. After the break, the 76ers caught fire, winning nine in a row at one point, and 23 of their last 33 to finish at 48–34, earning the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Iverson scored 55 points in the playoff opener against the New Orleans Hornets and the Sixers went on to win the series in six games. In the second round, the Detroit Pistons ended Philadelphia's playoff run in a frustrating six-game series that saw the 76ers lose twice in overtime, and once on a last-second shot in regulation. It would be nine years before the Sixers won another playoff series. , On Memorial Day, 2003, Brown abruptly resigned as head coach, taking over the reins in Detroit a few days later. Brown's Pistons would win the 2004 NBA Championship over the Los Angeles Lakers , in some ways avenging his loss to them in 2001. After being turned down by Jeff Van Gundy and Eddie Jordan , the 76ers hired Randy Ayers , an assistant under Brown, as their new head coach. Ayers lasted only 52 games and was fired with the team's record at 21–31. Chris Ford took over, but the 76ers finished the 2003–2004 season at 33–49, missing the playoffs for the first time in six years. Iverson, who was at odds with Ford throughout the interim coach's tenure, played only 48 games in a stormy, injury-plagued season. , For the 2004–2005 season, Philadelphia native Jim O'Brien was named head coach. Iverson was moved back to point guard and flourished, having arguably his finest season. He also impressed many with his willingness to get other players involved in the offense. During this season, Philadelphia acquired Chris Webber in a trade with the Sacramento Kings , with the hopes that the team had at long last found a consistent second scoring option to compliment Iverson. Andre Iguodala , Philadelphia's first-round pick in the 2004 NBA Draft , was named to the All-Rookie First Team, and the 76ers returned to the postseason with a 43–39 record. In the first round, they were defeated in five games by the defending NBA Champion Pistons, coached by Larry Brown. , Though the 2004–05 76ers exceeded many on-court expectations, there was a great deal of behind-the-scenes tension between O'Brien, his players, and the front office. Shortly after the season ended, O'Brien was fired and replaced by the popular Maurice Cheeks , who played for the team from 1978 to 1989, and was the starting point guard for the 1983 NBA Champions. However, the coaching change did not help team's fortunes for the 2005–06 season. A 2–10 stretch in March doomed them to missing the playoffs for the second time in three years with a 38–44 record. , With the opening of the 2006–07 season, the 76ers started out hot, going 3–0 for the first time since making it to the Finals five years previously. However, they stumbled through the first half of the season and couldn't quite recover, finishing 35–47, good for 3rd in the Atlantic Division, and 9th in the Eastern Conference (tied with Indiana). , On December 5, 2006, disappointed with the direction the team was headed, Allen Iverson gave the 76ers management an ultimatum: find players who will help support me or trade me. This was confirmed via an in-game interview with team owner, Ed Snider .  , On December 19, 2006, Allen Iverson , along with Ivan McFarlin , were sent to the Denver Nuggets in exchange for guard Andre Miller , forward Joe Smith , and two first-round draft picks. Then, on January 11, Sixers GM Billy King announced that the Sixers and aging forward Chris Webber had agreed to a buyout of the remainder of his contract. The Sixers would pay Webber $36 million over the next 1½ seasons, which is $7 million less than he would have been paid to play. After the buyout, the Sixers waived Webber, making him a free agent. Webber signed with the Detroit Pistons shortly thereafter. , The moves allowed the 76ers to make Iguodala the unquestioned leader of the team, and evaluate whether they saw him as a franchise player. The Sixers had started the year 3-0, then went 5-10 before Iverson left the team. They would stumble out to an eight-game losing streak with Iverson deactivated; however, they were able to finish the season on a high note, going 30-29 for the remainder of the season. They finished the year 35-47. , The Sixers drafted Georgia Tech SF Thaddeus Young with the 12th pick, traded with the Miami Heat for 21st pick Colorado State PF Jason Smith , traded with the Portland Trail Blazers for 42nd pick Vanderbilt SG/SF Derrick Byars , and then finally traded with the Utah Jazz for Providence PF Herbert Hill . , On December 4, 2007, the Sixers fired Billy King and replaced him with Nets GM Ed Stefanski .  , With Iguodala, the Sixers clinched a playoff berth with a win over the Atlanta Hawks on April 4, 2008. It was their first postseason appearance since 2005, as well as the first in the post-Iverson era. However, they were eliminated by the Pistons in six games, with Detroit winning the series 4–2. Even with this elimination, many fans considered this to be a successful season, considering that the Sixers were 12 games under .500 in early February and went on to have a run that led them to the playoffs and a 40–42 record. , On July 9, 2008, the 76ers signed power forward Elton Brand to a five-year, $79.795 million contract,  after trading Rodney Carney  and renouncing their rights to all their unrestricted free agents.  Brand had originally opted out of his contract with the Los Angeles Clippers , looking to re-sign with them.  But the 76ers offered him more money (he regarded their offer as the "Philly-Max") and a better chance at winning an NBA championship by playing in the Eastern Conference . This move has been the subject of controversy since there were rumors that he and Baron Davis had made a friendly agreement to play together for the Clippers.  The team later signed free agent point guard Royal Ivey of the Milwaukee Bucks ,  Kareem Rush from the Indiana Pacers ,  and then signed former Sixer Theo Ratliff after Jason Smith 's injury. Donyell Marshall was signed on September 2, 2008, after he stated to his agent that he wanted to go back home and end his career in Philadelphia.  Rush, Ivey, Ratliff and Marshall were all paid the veteran's minimum salary, but they were to be contributors to a team on the rise. During the off-season, they also re-signed restricted free agents Louis Williams and Andre Iguodala for five years/$25 million  and six years/$80 million, respectively.  , However, the Sixers couldn't find the form that pushed them to the playoffs last year. The Sixers started the year with a 9–14 record before firing head coach Maurice Cheeks on December 13. Assistant GM Tony DiLeo took over and the Sixers gradually improved. They finished the season with a 41–41 record, with a 32–27 record under DiLeo. Brand's first season with the Sixers ended early with a right shoulder injury that required surgery. Despite the loss of Brand, the Sixers earned a playoff berth with a 95–90 win against the Detroit Pistons on April 4, 2009, at home. , In the first round, they faced the Orlando Magic . Three of the first four games of the series provided late-game heroics. Iguodala and Thaddeus Young made game-winning shots in Games 1 and 3, respectively, while Orlando's Hedo Türkoğlu provided the game-winner in Game 4. Just like in the previous year's playoffs, the Sixers led 2–1 after three games, but the Magic won three straight to eliminate the Sixers from the playoffs. , It was also during the season that the Sixers played one home game at their old home, the Wachovia Spectrum . The Sixers won 104–101 over the Chicago Bulls on March 13, 2009. The game was played to provide the final curtain call on the Spectrum, which was scheduled to be imploded on New Year's Eve 2009. , Following the playoff loss, Tony DiLeo returned to his front office job, creating a head coaching vacancy. Former Washington Wizards coach Eddie Jordan was introduced as the 76ers' new coach on June 1, 2009.  In the 2009 off-season, the Sixers drafted UCLA point guard Jrue Holiday with the 17th pick. The Sixers also traded power forward Reggie Evans to the Toronto Raptors for a three-point specialist, small forward Jason Kapono , who had won back-to-back three-point shootouts in 2007 and 2008.  The off-season also marked the return of the 1977–97 76ers logo, along with a redesigned court and new uniforms updating the 1980s ones.  , On December 2, 2009, the Philadelphia 76ers announced that they had signed Allen Iverson to a one-year prorated $1.3 million non-guaranteed contract.  The 76ers were 5–13 at the time and had lost Louis Williams for at least 30 games to injury.  Iverson made his "re-debut" for the 76ers against the team he was traded to, the Denver Nuggets, to a thunderous ovation from the sell-out crowd, scoring 11 points, with six assists and five rebounds.  , However, the euphoria that greeted Iverson's return to the 76ers faded quickly. On February 22, Iverson announced he was leaving the 76ers indefinitely to attend to his daughter's illness, and a few weeks later the 76ers announced that Iverson would not be returning for the rest of the season. , The 76ers finished the season with a record of 27–55, their first 50-loss season since 1998. Most cited the reason behind this as the players' inability to play within Eddie Jordan's Princeton offense , with several players unhappy with his system. Hours after the 76ers' last game at Orlando on April 14, the team fired Jordan after one season. He was the fourth coach to be fired after one season or less since Larry Brown left the team in 2003.  , On May 20, 2010, TNT analyst Doug Collins was named head coach of the 76ers.  Collins played for the Sixers for his entire NBA career after being the first overall pick in the 1973 draft , and had previously coached the Chicago Bulls, Detroit Pistons, and the Washington Wizards. The 76ers had the sixth-best odds at receiving the top pick in the 2010 draft , and they managed to land the second overall pick, beating out the Warriors, Kings, Timberwolves, and Nets, who all had better odds. They used that draft pick to select Ohio State University's Evan Turner . , The Sixers started the season with an uninspiring 3–13 mark, but started turning things around, to finish with a 41-41 record. They clinched a playoff berth on April 1, 2011, their third in the last four years. The 76ers faced the heavily favored Miami Heat in the first round, and ultimately fell to them in five games. Although they lost the series, Collins was praised for turning around a lottery team in his first season, as well as winning a playoff game when many pundits predicted that the Sixers would be swept. Collins also finished second in Coach of the Year voting. , On July 13, 2011, Comcast-Spectacor reached an agreement to sell the 76ers to an investment group led by Apollo Global Management co-founder Joshua Harris . Harris' group paid $280 million for the franchise. The sale did not include any ownership stake in the Flyers or in Comcast Sportsnet. The Sixers will continue to play their home games at the Wells Fargo Center for the foreseeable future. Rapper Will Smith (a Philadelphia native) and his wife Jada Pinkett Smith are notable minority owners. The new ownership group decided to retain Head Coach Doug Collins and President of Basketball Operations Rod Thorn. Ed Stefanski, who served as the team's General Manager since 2007, was relieved of his duties. , The 2011–12 NBA season was delayed into December and the Sixers did not hold their home opener until January 6, 2012. The home opener marked the debut of an improved in-game presentation at the Wells Fargo Center. [ citation needed ] , The Sixers had their best start since the 2000-01 season with a 20–9 record, battling for the Eastern Conference's best record and taking a firm division lead. The Sixers, however, finished the rest of the season 15–22, giving them a 35–31 record. Attributed to their lack of a true go-to scorer, [ citation needed ] the 76ers lost hold of the top-three seed and division championship that they held for most of the season, by going on the losing steak. Nevertheless, they clinched their fourth playoff berth in the last five years on the penultimate play date of the season. , Philadelphia earned the eighth seed in the 2012 NBA playoffs , facing the 1st-seeded Chicago Bulls . Philadelphia improved from their struggles in the second half of the regular season, beating Chicago 4–2 to win their first series since 2003. This was the fifth time in NBA history that an eight seed has beaten a one seed. They then faced their rival, the Boston Celtics , in the second round, and were eliminated 4–3. The Sixers once again faced criticism for their lack of a true scorer, as they were not able to keep pace with the Celtics' scoring. They were, however, given credit for winning the regular-season series against Boston and forcing the playoff series to seven games against the Celtics, who had won the last four division championships. [ citation needed ] , In an effort to re-tool for the upcoming season, The 76ers selected Maurice 'Mo' Harkless , and Arnett Moultrie (via trade with Miami) in the 2012 NBA draft . The Sixers then used their amnesty clause on Elton Brand , traded for Dorell Wright , signed Nick Young , Kwame Brown , and Royal Ivey , and re-signed Spencer Hawes while Lavoy Allen . Lou Williams , and Jodie Meeks left through free agency. , On August 9, 2012, the 76ers agreed to a four-team trade with the Los Angeles Lakers , Orlando Magic and Denver Nuggets . In the trade that sent six-time All-Star Dwight Howard to the Lakers, Philadelphia agreed to send 2011 first-round pick Nikola Vučević , 2012 first-round draft pick Maurice Harkless , and a future first-round draft pick to Orlando, as well as All-Star swingman Andre Iguodala to Denver. In exchange, they received Jason Richardson from the Magic and All-Star center Andrew Bynum from the Los Angeles Lakers.  , The Sixers started the 2012–13 NBA season with high expectations with the help of Andrew Bynum and the growth of the young Sixers. However, Bynum's debut with the 76ers took a hit when he was sidelined for precautionary reasons, in relation to the Orthokine knee procedure he received during the off-season. At first it looked like Bynum would be out only shortly, but little success in healing and setbacks pushed Bynum's return date further and further. As a result of many setbacks, on March 19, the Sixers announced that Bynum would have season-ending surgery on both knees.  Bynum wasn't the only Sixer to suffer through injuries. On February 8, Jason Richardson also went through a season-ending knee surgery.  Jrue Holiday , Thaddeus Young , Nick Young , and Royal Ivey also had injuries that sidelined them for weeks. By the end of the season, Evan Turner and Spencer Hawes were the only Sixers to play in every game during the season. The Sixers started the season 12–9 but stumbled through a tough stretch and couldn't recover. The Sixers finished the season 34–48, missing the playoffs for the first time since Doug Collins had taken over as head coach. , On April 18, Collins resigned as 76ers coach, citing his declining health and need to spend time with his grandchildren. He stayed with the team as an adviser.  Soon after, general manager Tony DiLeo had "cut ties" with the team. [ citation needed ] On May 11, it was announced that Sam Hinkie , who had previously worked for the Houston Rockets , would replace DiLeo as general manager.  On July 8, it was announced that Adam Aron had stepped down as CEO, and was being replaced by Scott O'Neil. Aron maintained his position as co-owner of the team. [ citation needed ] , Following the 2012–13 season, the Sixers, led by Hinkie, chose to shift in the direction of rebuilding the franchise. The first move of this new plan was executed during the 2013 draft , when the Sixers agreed in principle to trade Jrue Holiday and the 42nd pick in the draft, Pierre Jackson , to the New Orleans Pelicans for Nerlens Noel and the Pelicans' 2014 first-round pick. The trade was later made official on July 12.  The trade was seen by some [ who? ] as somewhat surprising, as Holiday had been the team's marquee player and was coming off a season that saw him make his first NBA All-Star Game . Additionally, Noel was recovering from an anterior cruciate ligament injury suffered while in college, strongly indicating that he would not be able to make an immediate impact for the Sixers as he would be inactive to start the season. The Sixers used the 11th pick in the draft to select Michael Carter-Williams as Holiday's replacement as the starting point guard. The Sixers chose Arsalan Kazemi with the 54th overall pick, making Kazemi the first Iranian chosen in the NBA draft.  , Following the Holiday trade, many of the team's returning players were either waived or left the team in free agency, most notably Andrew Bynum ; of the 15 players on the team's roster during their final game of the 2012–13 season, only six remained with the team by January 1, 2014. In their place were a number of young prospects, many coming from the NBA Development League or signing with the Sixers after playing limited roles on other teams. Further moves at the trade deadline on February 20, 2014, saw the exits of veterans Spencer Hawes , Evan Turner , and Lavoy Allen , all of whom were key rotational players. , The 76ers, predicted by many [ who? ] to finish with the worst record in the league, had a 3–0 start that included wins over the two-time defending champion Miami Heat and a Chicago Bulls team with high expectations. However, the Sixers struggled mightily after that, at one point posting a 26-game losing streak which set a franchise record  and tied the all-time NBA record for most consecutive losses in a single-season.  The Sixers finished the season with a 19–63 record, the third-worst in franchise history. Despite that, the Sixers did not have the worst win/loss record in the overall NBA standings: the Bucks fared worse with a 15–67 record. , Carter-Williams led all rookies in points, rebounds, assists, and steals, joining Magic Johnson and Oscar Robertson as the only rookies to do such a feat.  He also won the player of the week award in his first week, being the second rookie after Shaquille O'Neal to accomplish that.  He went on to win the Rookie of the Year award, becoming the first rookie drafted 10th or later to win the award since Mark Jackson in 1987 for the Knicks .  , In the 2014 NBA draft , the Sixers selected Joel Embiid with the third overall pick, and traded with Orlando for Croatian prospect Dario Šarić , the twelfth pick of the draft. Neither prospect was expected to make an immediate impact for the Sixers, as Embiid was recovering from a stress fracture in the navicular bone , while Šarić will likely spend one or more years playing in the Turkish League .  In the second round, the Sixers selected K. J. McDaniels , Jerami Grant , Jordan McRae , and Serbian prospect Vasilije Micić . The Sixers also traded a second-round pick to re-acquire Pierre Jackson from the New Orleans Pelicans .  , In the 2014 off-season, the Sixers traded Thaddeus Young to Minnesota in the Kevin Love to Cleveland trade, and received the Heat's 2015 first-round draft pick, Luc Mbah a Moute and Alexey Shved , leaving only two players with three years of experience on the Sixers remaining. , On November 29, 2014, the 76ers lost to the Dallas Mavericks 103–110 and set a franchise record for losses to start the season, as they fell to a record of 0–16.  After losing their next game against the San Antonio Spurs to make it 0–17, the 76ers were on the verge of tying the NBA record of 18 straight losses to start a season if they lost to the Minnesota Timberwolves on December 3, but they broke their losing streak and won their first game of the 2014–15 season with an 85–77 victory at Minnesota.  , In three deals at the 2015 NBA trade deadline, the 76ers traded Carter-Williams and McDaniels for JaVale McGee , Isaiah Canaan , and three draft picks, including a protected 2015 first round pick originally owned by the Los Angeles Lakers . , On May 19, the 76ers were awarded the third overall pick in the NBA Draft , which is scheduled to take place June 25 at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York . , During the 2014-15 playoffs, the 76ers started referring to their stadium as "The Center," because Wells Fargo left sponsorship with the 76ers, but still has naming rights to their arena. It makes a lot of sense, since they've drafted a center with their first pick for the third consecutive season. , 1963–1997 logo , While team colors have changed somewhat over the years, with emphasis alternating between blue, white, red, and even black and gold, the 76ers have always been closely identified with the logo featuring the number 76 with 13 stars arranged in a circle above the number 7 to represent the original 13 American colonies. The logo portrays the patriotic nature of the United States , prominently featuring the colors red, blue and white, and Philadelphia 's reputation as the birthplace of American independence . The logo was used from 1963 to 1977, after which it was slightly modified to feature the full team nickname and a basketball adorning the logo. This iteration was used from 1977 to 1997. The 76ers also had an alternate logo with the '76' wordmark inside the silhouette of the Liberty Bell with 'Philadelphia' on top. , Uniforms during this era varied between blue and red. During much of the 1960s, the abbreviated city name 'PHILA' adorned the uniforms, ranging from fancy and contemporary two-tone script to classic block lettering, the latter of which was used during their 1967 title run. Blue was the primary road color for most of the 1960s (except the 1965–66 season ), but for the 1968–69 season, red became the primary away color, with the away uniform featuring 'PHILA' and the block numbers in white with blue trim (later switching color designations in the 1970–71 season). Player names were also added as part of the NBA mandate. A uniquely-designed home uniform was used in the second half of the 1971 season, featuring a script 'Seventy Sixers' wordmark in red with blue trim, the only time the full team name was used on the uniform. , From 1971 to 1978 they returned to blue as the primary road color, with the more popular moniker 'SIXERS' written in Art Deco lettering. With various adjustments from block lettering to Bookman Old Style font, this version with stars in side stripes stayed until 1978. The uniforms from 1978 to 1991 were a classic nod to their 1967 uniforms, except that the road color is red and the home lettering is blue with red trim. The name 'SIXERS' was featured in block lettering. This uniform was used in their 1983 title run. From 1991 to 1994, the Sixers followed other teams in designing more graphic-laden uniforms by featuring a streaking blue splash with tricolored stars heading up to the word 'SIXERS' in Helvetica and in either red (home) or white (away). In addition, the word 'PHILADELPHIA' was added atop the team name. From 1994 to 1997, the Sixers return to a more basic uniform design, featuring a more ornate lettering. The team name is in red (home) and white (away), with numbers in blue. , In the 1997–98 NBA season , the Sixers drastically changed their logo and colors in an effort to appeal to a more youthful, hip-hop oriented culture. The iconic 76 logo was dropped, and a new logo was introduced, featuring a bigger 76ers script, with a single star behind the number 7 and a streaking basketball below. More controversially, gold and black were introduced to the color scheme,along with red, white and blue. Uniforms were primarily white (home), and black (away), with slight adjustments in the home logo lettering (gold 1997–2000, black 2000–09), trim and piping. Until the 2006–07 season, player names featured a red trim, before dropping it altogether and shrunk the font size in the 2007–08 season; the alternates adopted this design that season, with the regular uniforms following suit that same season. A blue alternate uniform was worn 1999–2006, while a red alternate uniform, featuring a return to the 'PHILA' script in then-current lettering, was worn 2006–09. This logo and color scheme were used until the 2008–09 NBA season . , During the 2008–09 season, while the previous logo was still in use, the original 'Stars and Stripes' 76 logo was revived to coincide with the team's 60th anniversary (counting the Syracuse years). The previous 1977–97 logo was reintroduced, with the addition of a red square and 'Philadelphia' inside a blue rectangle below it, although the partial logo without the square, city name and rectangles was also used. Uniform colors for this anniversary edition were white only, using the 1978–91 design. The anniversary uniforms proved so popular that they inspired the team to return to the old logo and color scheme full-time for the 2009–10 season, with red away uniforms completing the ensemble. This variation featured different striping patterns, team name in blue and numbers in red on the home uniforms, and monotone script. This combination continues to represent the 76ers to the present. A blue alternate uniform, which mirrors that of the red away uniform, was unveiled before the 2012–13 season. For the 2013–14 season, the blue uniforms will be the primary while the red uniforms will be the alternate, marking the first season since 1977–78 that the 76ers wore blue as a primary away uniform. The red uniform was retired prior to the 2014–15 season.  , A new version of the classic 76ers logo was unveiled for the 2015–16 season, featuring a slight tilt to the white basketball and a roundel featuring the city name and six stars. A secondary " Dribbling Ben Franklin " logo was also introduced. The home white, away blue and red alternate uniforms featured a mix of classic styles used in previous uniforms. The home white and away blue uniforms featured the 'PHILA' wordmark as homage to the late 1960s uniforms, while the red alternates featured the 'SIXERS' wordmark in tribute to the 1980s uniforms. Side stripes featuring seven stars on one side and six on the other pay homage to the 1970s uniforms, while the shoulder piping was a callback to the 1980s uniforms. The inscription 'PHILA TOUGH' is sewed on the bottom of all uniforms.  , The rivalry between the 76ers and Boston Celtics is the earliest dated rivalry in the NBA. The two teams have the most meetings in the NBA Playoffs , playing each other in nineteen series, of which the Celtics have won twelve.  It is considered to be the 2nd greatest rivalry in the NBA next to the Celtics–Lakers rivalry .  The rivalry first peaked when Wilt Chamberlain and Bill Russell of the Celtics played each other from 1965 to 1968. The 1966-67 Sixers, voted the best team in league history during the NBA's 35th anniversary, set a then-record by winning 68 games in the 82 game season (a record since broken by the Lakers then Bulls) and ending Boston's eight-year title reign which led to the infamous "Boston's Dead!" chants. , The 76ers went through a rebuilding period through the early 1970s, however came back to relevance during the 1976 season in which they defeated the Celtics en route to a Finals appearance. Both teams would peak in the 80's, with every single Eastern Conference Championship between 1980 and 1987 belonging to either the 76ers or Celtics. The Larry Bird-led Celtics won five of them, while the Julius Erving-led 76ers won the other three. The Charles Barkley-led Sixers of the later 80's took the fight to the Celtics, however neither team experienced much playoff success in the late 80's and both took steep nosedives in the Eastern Conference rankings throughout the 90's. , The rivalry was reborn in the new millennium. The first time, the Allen Iverson-led defending-Eastern Conference champions 76ers were defeated in the first round of the 2002 playoffs by the Paul Pierce-led Celtics 3-2. The second time, exactly ten years later, the Big Three Celtics (Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Ray Allen) defeated the valiant eight seed 76ers team 4-3. In the ten years in between, the Sixers would experience limited success whereas the Celtics won a championship and contended for most of that span. In a memorable 2006 regular season meeting between the two, the 76ers defeated the Celtics 125-124 in triple overtime, with Iverson leading the way with 33 points and 10 assists. , The rivalry started due to the proximity of two cities, 2 hours by car, and the rivalries between two cities with sports teams was the stemming of the Mets–Phillies rivalry of the Major League Baseball , the Eagles–Giants rivalry of the National Football League , and the Flyers–Rangers rivalry of the National Hockey League . This rivalry, however, isn't as fierce as the others. , The Los Angeles Lakers are the Sixers' biggest rival from the Western Conference . The rivalry has been most intense during the late 1970s and early 80s, when both teams were big title contenders with well-known NBA players such as Magic Johnson , Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , Julius Erving , and Moses Malone . During this period, the teams have met each other in the NBA Finals 3 times; in 1980 , 1982 , and 1983 . The Lakers took the series in 1980 and 1982, but the Sixers won the series in 1983. , The rivalry was dormant during the rest of the 1980s and the entire 1990s with the 76ers going through tough rebuilding times. However, the rivalry made a comeback in the 2001 NBA Finals , when the Allen Iverson and Dikembe Mutombo led Sixers met the Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal led Lakers. The Sixers shocked the world by beating the seemingly unbeatable Lakers in Game 1 at Los Angeles. The Lakers, however, would take the next four games to win the series. The rivalry has cooled since then with both the Sixers and Lakers going through rebuilding periods. , Sixer fans also have their own rivalry with the Lakers' Kobe Bryant. This rivalry started in the 2001 NBA Finals when Kobe proclaimed he was "coming to Philly to cut their hearts out." (Coincidentally, Bryant himself was born in Philadelphia.) This began an unforgiving attitude from Sixers fanatics that continues to this day.  , , The following players have rights owned by the Philadelphia 76ers. , Bold denotes still active with team.

The Raptors are part of the league's Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference . The team was established in 1995, along with the Vancouver Grizzlies , as part of the NBA's expansion into Canada. When the Grizzlies relocated to Memphis, Tennessee to become the Memphis Grizzlies in 2001, the Raptors became the only Canadian-based team in the NBA. They originally played their home games at the SkyDome (later renamed Rogers Centre), before moving along Bremner Boulevard to the Air Canada Centre in 1999. , Like most expansion teams, the Raptors struggled in their early years, but after the acquisition of Vince Carter through a draft day trade in 1998 , the team set league attendance records and made the NBA playoffs in 2000 , 2001 , and 2002 . Carter was instrumental in leading the team to a then-franchise high 47 wins and their first playoff series win in 2001, where they advanced to the Eastern Conference Semifinals. During the 2002–03 and 2003–04 seasons , they failed to make significant progress and he was traded in 2004 to the New Jersey Nets . , After Carter left, Chris Bosh emerged as the team leader. In 2006–07 , Bryan Colangelo 's first full season as President and General Manager, a combination of Bosh, 2006 first overall NBA draft pick Andrea Bargnani and a revamp of the roster helped the Raptors qualify for their first playoff berth in five years , capturing the Atlantic Division title with 47 wins. In the 2007–08 season , they advanced to the playoffs again, but failed to make the playoffs in each of the next five seasons. In a bid to persuade Bosh to stay, Colangelo overhauled the team roster for the 2009–10 season , but Bosh signed with the Miami Heat in July 2010, ushering in yet another era of rebuilding for the Raptors. , After Masai Ujiri was brought in as the new General Manager in 2013, he traded Bargnani to the New York Knicks . With a backcourt led by Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan , the Raptors returned to the playoffs , won their second Atlantic Division title, and won a franchise record 48 games in the 2013–14 season . However, they failed for a fourth consecutive time to advance beyond the first round of the playoffs. In the 2014–15 season, they won another franchise record of 49 wins, but failed for a fifth consecutive time to advance beyond the first round of the playoffs, getting swept by the Washington Wizards, 4–0. , , , The Toronto Raptors were established on November 4, 1993, when the NBA, as part of its expansion into Canada, awarded its 28th franchise to a group headed by Toronto businessman John Bitove for a then-record expansion fee of $125 million US.  Bitove and Allan Slaight of Slaight Communications each owned 44%, with the Bank of Nova Scotia (10%), David Peterson (1%), and Phil Granovsky (1%) being minority partners.   The Raptors, along with the Vancouver Grizzlies , played their first game in 1995, and were the first NBA teams based in Canada since the 1946–47 Toronto Huskies ,  though the Buffalo Braves had played a total of 16 regular season games at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto from 1971–75.  , Initial sentiment was in favour of reviving the Huskies nickname, but team management realized it would be nearly impossible to design a logo that did not substantially resemble that of the Minnesota Timberwolves .  As a result, a nationwide contest was held to help name the team and develop their colours and logo. Over 2,000 entries were narrowed down to ten prospects: Beavers, Bobcats, Dragons, Grizzlies, Hogs, Raptors, Scorpions, T-Rex, Tarantulas, and Terriers.  The final selection— Toronto Raptors —was unveiled on Canadian national television on May 15, 1994:  the choice was influenced by the popularity of the 1993 film Jurassic Park . The name "Raptor" is a common informal name for the velociraptor , a swift medium-sized dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaur. On May 24, 1994, the team's logo and first General Manager , Isiah Thomas were revealed at a press conference.  As part of the deal, Thomas received an option to purchase part of the team, reportedly for under market value.   He would purchase 4.5% in May 1995   and a further 4.5% in December 1995,   half each from Bitove and Slaight, decreasing their share to 39.5%.   The team's colours of bright red, purple, black, and silver were also revealed; "Naismith" silver was chosen as an ode to Canadian James Naismith , the inventor of basketball.  The team originally competed in the Central Division ,  and before the inaugural season began, sales of Raptors merchandise ranked seventh in the league, marking a successful return of professional basketball to Canada.  , As General Manager, Isiah Thomas quickly staffed the management positions with his own personnel, naming long-time Detroit Pistons assistant Brendan Malone as the Raptors' head coach.  The team's roster was then filled as a result of an expansion draft in 1995 . Following a coin flip , Toronto was given first choice and selected Chicago Bulls point guard and three-point specialist B. J. Armstrong . Armstrong refused to report for training and Thomas promptly traded him to the Golden State Warriors for power forwards Carlos Rogers and Victor Alexander .  Thomas then selected a wide range of players in the expansion draft, including veterans Jerome Kersey , Willie Anderson and his former Pistons teammate John "Spider" Salley .  , Subsequent to the expansion draft, the Raptors landed the seventh pick in the NBA draft lottery , behind their fellow 1995 expansion club, the Vancouver Grizzlies. Thomas selected Damon Stoudamire , a point guard out of Arizona , around whom the franchise would seek to construct its near future. Yet, the selection of Stoudamire was met with boos from fans at the 1995 NBA draft at SkyDome in Toronto, many of whom wanted Ed O'Bannon of UCLA , an NCAA Final Four Most Valuable Player .  , In the team's first official NBA game, Alvin Robertson scored the first NBA points in Raptors history,  while Stoudamire recorded 10 points and 10 assists in a 94–79 victory over the New Jersey Nets .  The Raptors concluded their inaugural season with a 21–61 win–loss record,  although they were one of the few teams to defeat the Chicago Bulls,  who set an all-time NBA best 72–10 win–loss regular season record. With averages of 19.0 points and 9.3 assists per game, Stoudamire also won the 1995–96 Rookie of the Year Award .  , In November of the 1996–97 season , Bitove sold his ownership interest in the team to Slaight for $65 million after Slaight had activated a shotgun clause in their partnership agreement,    giving Slaight 79% control of the team,  and remaining minority partner of the Bank of Nova Scotia (10%), Thomas (9%) Peterson (1%) and Granovsky (1%).  Slaight subsequently acquired the 1% which had been owned by both Peterson and Granovsky, who had died a year earlier.    The team improved on its win record by nine games.  They selected centre Marcus Camby with the second overall pick in the 1996 NBA draft .  By the end of the season, Camby earned a berth on the NBA's All-Rookie Team while Stoudamire continued to play well, averaging 20.2 points and 8.8 assists per game.  As in the previous season, the Raptors were one of only 11 teams to topple the eventual 1997 Champions, the Chicago Bulls.   The Raptors also defeated the Houston Rockets , Utah Jazz and Miami Heat , all of whom were eventual Conference finalists.   However, the Raptors struggled against teams who were not of championship calibre, including three losses to the 15–67 Boston Celtics .  , In the 1997–98 season , the team suffered numerous injuries and slid into a 17-game losing streak.  After Thomas' attempts to execute a letter of intent with Slaight to purchase the team failed, he resigned his position with the team in November and sold his 9% stake in the team to Slaight.    This left Slaight with 90% and the Bank of Nova Scotia with 10%.  Thomas was replaced by Glen Grunwald as GM.  With Thomas gone, Stoudamire immediately sought a trade.  On February 13, 1998, he was shipped to the Portland Trail Blazers along with Walt Williams and Carlos Rogers for Kenny Anderson , Alvin Williams , Gary Trent , two first-round draft choices, a second-round draft choice and cash.  Anderson refused to report to Toronto and was traded to the Celtics with Žan Tabak and Popeye Jones for Chauncey Billups , Dee Brown , Roy Rogers and John Thomas .  When the trading deadline was over, the Raptors became the youngest team in the league with an average age of 24.6.  They had five rookies on their roster, including the 18-year-old Tracy McGrady , who at the time was the youngest player in the NBA.  The inexperienced Raptors struggled throughout the season and their regular season record regressed to 16–66.  , On February 12, 1998, Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. , the owners of the Toronto Maple Leafs , purchased 100% of the Raptors and the arena the team was building, Air Canada Centre , from Slaight and the Bank of Nova Scotia.   MLSE paid a reported $467 million, made up of $179 million for the team and $288 million for the arena.    During the 1998 NBA draft , in what became a defining move for the franchise, Grunwald traded the team's 4th overall pick Antawn Jamison to the Golden State Warriors for Vince Carter , who was selected 5th overall.  To bring further credibility to the Raptors, Grunwald traded Camby to the New York Knicks for Charles Oakley ,  a veteran with playoff experience. Kevin Willis , another veteran acquired from the trade, solidified the centre position, while the coaching staff temporarily rotated Brown, Williams and Doug Christie to play point guard. Both Christie and Williams became talented players in their own right; Christie developed into one of the elite defenders in the NBA,  while Williams improved his play on the offensive end. New coach Butch Carter was also credited with much of the team's turnaround during the lockout shortened 1998–99 season . Although the team did not make the playoffs , many were optimistic with the impressive performances of Rookie of the Year Carter  and a much improved McGrady. , During the 1999 NBA draft , believing that the Raptors still lacked a strong frontcourt presence, Grunwald traded first-round draft pick Jonathan Bender for veteran power forward Antonio Davis of the Indiana Pacers .  In the backcourt, Carter, Christie, Williams and Dell Curry played at the shooting guard position and Muggsy Bogues at point guard. The rotation of Davis, Oakley and Willis in the frontcourt and Carter's and McGrady's improvement helped the team make its first ever playoff appearance, fulfilling a promise Carter had made to fans in the previous season.  Lacking significant post-season experience, Toronto was defeated 3–0 by the New York Knicks in the first round.  Nonetheless, team improvements and the rise of Carter—who emphatically won the 2000 NBA Slam Dunk Contest  —attracted many fans around Toronto, many of whom were previously not basketball fans. The season was also the first full year played at the Air Canada Centre , after having played four years at the cavernous SkyDome , which was better suited to baseball and Canadian football .  Overall, the Raptors concluded the season with a 45–37 record.  , Still, playoff failures and Butch Carter's media altercations surrounding Camby led Grunwald to replace Carter prior to the 2000–01 season with Lenny Wilkens , a Hall of Fame coach and player with more than 30 years of coaching experience.  The team roster was also largely revamped, including the signing of veteran playmaker Mark Jackson on a four-year contract.  When Alvin Williams later emerged as a clutch performer,  Jackson was traded to allow Williams more playing time.  In the 2000 off-season, free agent McGrady opted to leave the Raptors in a sign-and-trade deal worth $67.5 million over six years, while giving a conditional draft pick as part of the agreement to the Orlando Magic , for a first-round draft pick.  , As predicted by analysts, the team easily secured a berth in the 2001 NBA playoffs with a franchise high 47 wins. The Raptors won their first ever playoff series as they defeated New York 3–2, advancing to the Eastern Conference Semifinals for the first time in franchise history.   Wilkens was praised for having Williams defend shooting guard Allan Houston and Carter defend small forward Latrell Sprewell , the two major Knicks offensive threats. The series with Philadelphia 76ers was a landmark for the Raptors in terms of performance and entertainment value. The Sixers relied on Allen Iverson and Dikembe Mutombo for their respective offensive and defensive abilities, along with steady help from Aaron McKie . Toronto was the more balanced team with Carter, Alvin Williams and Davis providing much of the offensive game and Chris Childs and Jerome Williams on defence. The series came down to the last few seconds of Game 7, when Carter's potential series-winning shot rolled off the rim.  Carter was later widely criticized for attending his graduation ceremony at the University of North Carolina on the morning of Game 7, as he scored only 20 points on 6-for-18 shooting, after a 39-point performance in Game 6.   Despite the loss, the season is generally considered a watermark for the franchise, given the Raptors' franchise high of 47 wins and advancing beyond the first round of the playoffs.   , The relocation of the Vancouver Grizzlies to Memphis , Tennessee in 2001, as the Memphis Grizzlies , left Toronto as the NBA's only Canadian team.  In the summer of 2001, long-term contracts were given to Alvin Williams, Jerome Williams and Davis, while former NBA MVP centre Hakeem Olajuwon was signed to provide Carter with good support.  The Raptors appeared to be on their way to another competitive season, with a 29–21 record going into the All-Star break  and with Carter the top vote-getter for the All-Star game for the third consecutive year.  Carter then suffered a bout of patellar tendinitis (also known as "jumper's knee")  forcing him to miss the All-Star game and the rest of the season,  and without their franchise player, Toronto lost 13 consecutive games.  However, they were able to win 12 of their last 14 games, clinching a playoff spot on the last day of the regular season.  The comeback featured some of the Raptors' best defence of the season, along with inspired performances by Davis and Keon Clark . , Despite Toronto's improved defensive performances, Carter's offence was sorely missed in the first-round series against the second-seeded Detroit Pistons . In the first game, Detroit overwhelmed Toronto 83–65, largely due to Ben Wallace 's strong performance of 19 points, 20 rebounds , 3 blocks and 3 steals .  Detroit also won Game 2, but Toronto won the next two games at home to force a deciding and tightly contested Game 5 in Detroit.  With 10.7 seconds left in the game, and the Raptors down 85–82 with possession of the ball, Childs raced down the court and shot a three-pointer that missed badly, apparently trying to draw a foul on the play,  instead of passing to a wide-open Curry. In a post-game locker room interview, Childs repeatedly insisted that the Raptors had been down four points, not three. The Raptors' late-season surge was thus marred by a disappointing playoff exit; the Olajuwon experiment was also a bust, with the 39-year-old averaging career lows in minutes, points and rebounds.  Furthermore, Childs, Clark, and Curry left the team, ensuring a new-look team for the next season. , The 2002–03 season began with the same optimism that the Raptors exhibited in three consecutive playoff seasons, although it faded early. Carter, while voted as a starter in the 2003 All-Star Game ,  suffered a knee injury, while Davis expressed disinterest in Toronto, and Wilkens' laissez-faire attitude created a team that lacked the motivation and spirit of the previous years' teams. The team was ravaged with injuries, losing an NBA record number of player games due to injury.  Furthermore, the Raptors recorded the dubious honour of being the only team in NBA history to not dress 12 players for a single game in a season.  Wilkens was criticized heavily by the Toronto media for his inability to clamp down on his players when necessary, especially given this was the year that Wilkens overtook Bill Fitch for the most losses by an NBA coach,  with his loss total getting dangerously close to his win total. The Raptors ended the season with a 24–58 record  and Wilkens was fired. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise, when the Raptors were given the 4th overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft and brought another star to Toronto in Chris Bosh . , Canadian country singer Shania Twain helped launch the new red Raptors alternate road uniform at the start of the 2003–04 season ,  and the jerseys made their debut in a 90–87 season-opening victory on October 29, 2003 against the defending Conference Champion New Jersey Nets .  Davis and Jerome Williams were traded early in the season for Jalen Rose and Donyell Marshall . After 50 games, Toronto was 25–25 and in a position to make the playoffs , but injuries to key players sent the Raptors plummeting down the standings. Rose, Carter, and Alvin Williams all suffered injuries as the Raptors struggled to a record of 8–24 in their remaining games.  The notable individual season performances were Carter's 22.5 ppg , Marshall's 10.7 rpg and rookie Bosh, a 6–10 forward-centre who averaged 11.5 ppg and 7.4 rpg and was named to the NBA All-Rookie Team.  Williams' knee injury turned out to be career-ending. , For the 2004–05 season , the team moved into the Atlantic Division and the Raptors decided to revamp the team. Raptors President and CEO of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment Richard Peddie fired Grunwald on April 1, 2004, after the team ended the season three games short of the eighth and final playoff spot in the previous season.  Head coach Kevin O'Neill and his four assistant coaches were also dismissed immediately after Grunwald's termination. Toronto interim manager Jack McCloskey said: "While the blame for that certainly does not rest on O'Neill and his staff alone, we need a change."  Rob Babcock was named General Manager on June 7, 2004, alongside the appointments of Wayne Embry as senior advisor and Alex English as director of player development.  Sam Mitchell , a former NBA forward and assistant coach of the Milwaukee Bucks was hired as new head coach of the Raptors.  , Babcock's first move as GM was drafting centre Rafael Araújo —selected eighth overall—in the 2004 NBA draft , in a move that was criticized by fans and analysts, considering highly touted swingman Andre Iguodala was drafted with the next pick.  Babcock signed point guard Rafer Alston to a five-year deal. After Vince Carter's annual charity game, Babcock implicitly revealed to the media that Carter's agent had asked for a trade confirming Carter was discontent. The Toronto Sun reported that Carter felt he was being misled by the Raptors' hierarchy during the General Manager search and had concluded that as long as the managerial structure at Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment Ltd. remained intact, the Raptors would never be an elite team.  Carter was finally traded mid-season, ending his six-year tenure. Toronto received Alonzo Mourning , forwards Eric Williams and Aaron Williams and two mid-to-late future first round picks from the New Jersey Nets. Mourning chose not to report to Toronto, forcing Babcock to buy out the remainder of his contract  at a reported $10 million, leaving him free to sign with the Miami Heat . Eric and Aaron Williams were supposed to add defensive toughness and rebounding, but were generally under-utilized for the entire season. Analysts had predicted Babcock got the bad end of the deal,  and the trade eventually cost him his job. , Carter's departure heralded a new era for Toronto. Bosh stepped up to the role of franchise player  and performed well in his sophomore campaign, ranking tenth in the league in defensive rebounds.  In contrast to Bosh's emergence, Araújo struggled to keep a spot in the line-up, and became unpopular with fans and local media.  Although the ACC was often well-attended due to the Raptors' 22–19 home record,  their inability to win on the road (11–30) and poor defensive record made Mitchell's first year as head coach unimpressive. Additionally, Mitchell had problems dealing with Alston, who openly expressed his unhappiness with Mitchell in a post-game interview.  Later in the season, Alston was suspended two games for "conduct detrimental to the team" for reportedly walking out of a scrimmage during practice.  Notwithstanding the unrest, in their first season competing in the Atlantic Division, Toronto maintained the same regular season record of 33–49 as the previous season.  , The Raptors continued to rebuild during the 2005 NBA draft , selecting Charlie Villanueva , Joey Graham , Roko Ukić and Uroš Slokar , with Villanueva's selection being very controversial amongst basketball pundits and Raptors fans alike.  The Raptors started their training camp by trading Alston to the Houston Rockets for Mike James , and signing free agent José Calderón as a back-up for James. Despite the infusion of new players, Toronto's overall 2005–06 season was a disappointment; they set a franchise record by losing their first nine games  and 15 out of their first 16 games.  With losses mounting and media scrutiny intensifying, the Raptors hired ex- Purdue coach Gene Keady as an assistant off the bench to help develop the young Raptors team, as well as establish a defensive persona for the team. On January 15, 2006, the Raptors set a franchise points record in a 129–103 win over the Knicks when Villanueva hit a three-pointer late in the game,  but less than a week later, the Raptors gave up an 18-point lead against the Los Angeles Lakers , and allowed Lakers star Kobe Bryant to score 81 points, the second highest single-game total in NBA history.  With media scrutiny intensifying once more and the Raptors entrenched at the bottom of the league in defensive field goal percentage ,  Toronto fired Babcock.  , The 2005–06 season was not a total disaster. Villanueva's play impressed both fans and former critics as he came in second in NBA Rookie of the Year  and recorded 48 points in an overtime loss to Milwaukee Bucks, the most points scored by any rookie in franchise history and the most by a rookie in the NBA since 1997.  Bosh was also named a reserve forward for the Eastern All-Star Team in the 2006 game ,  becoming the third Raptor after Vince Carter and Antonio Davis to appear in an All-Star Game. On February 27, 2006, the team named Bryan Colangelo , the 2004–05 NBA Executive of the Year , the President and General Manager of the Raptors.  Known for his success in transforming a lottery Phoenix team into a 62-win offensive juggernaut, his hiring gave hope to many fans. Still, Toronto ended the season weakly when Bosh suffered a season-ending thumb injury.  The Raptors lost 10 in a row after Bosh's injury  and finished the season with the fifth worst record (27–55) in the NBA.  , The 2006–07 season represented a watershed year for the Raptors franchise. The roster was overhauled, including the selection of 2006 NBA draft number one pick Andrea Bargnani , the acquisition of point guard T. J. Ford in exchange for Villanueva, and the signing of shooting guard Anthony Parker and small forward Jorge Garbajosa .  Bosh was given a three-year contract extension,  while Maurizio Gherardini of Benetton Treviso was hired as the club's vice-president and assistant general manager.  , The first half of the season produced mixed results as Toronto struggled towards the .500 mark.  After the All-Star break , Bargnani continued to work on his defence and shooting (averaging 14.3 points per game (ppg) and 3.9 rebounds per game (rpg) in 12 games for the month of February 2007), and he was selected as the Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month for the second straight time on March 1, 2007.  Bargnani became the third Raptor ever to win the award twice, joining Vince Carter and Damon Stoudamire .  Toronto ended the regular season with a 47–35 record, securing the third seed in the Eastern Conference for the 2007 NBA Playoffs along with the Atlantic Division title, as well as homecourt advantage for the first time in franchise history.   Bosh was voted to start in the 2007 NBA All-Star Game .  The Raptors were also praised for their improved defence, ball-sharing and tremendous team chemistry.  Colangelo, Gherardini and Mitchell were credited with Toronto's turnaround this season,  which was one of the best in NBA history in terms of league standing and defensive ranking.  Mitchell was subsequently named the 2006–07 NBA Coach of the Year , the first coach in Raptors history to receive the honour,  while Colangelo was named 2006–07 Executive of the Year.  On April 24, 2007, the Raptors won their first playoff game in five seasons, with an 89–83 victory over the New Jersey Nets ,  but lost the series 4–2.  The series was notable for pitting ex-Raptor Carter against his former team. The Nets took home court advantage in Game 1, holding off a late Raptors rally in the fourth quarter. The Raptors pulled away in another tight game to even the series at one game apiece. When the series shifted to New Jersey , the Nets took charge of the series, winning games 3 and 4 in routs. New Jersey had a chance to win the series in game 5 in Toronto, but the Raptors took a 20-point lead after one quarter. Still, New Jersey managed to chip away, and had a chance to win the game, but Boštjan Nachbar 's three-pointer missed at the buzzer. Needing to win in New Jersey to force a game 7, Toronto held a one-point lead with under a minute to play in game 6, but Richard Jefferson hit a layup with eight seconds left to play. Toronto attempted to try for the game-winning shot, but Jefferson intercepted a pass to seal the series for the Nets. , Several changes to the roster were made before the 2007–08 campaign as Toronto sought to reproduce the same form as the previous campaign. Most notably, the Raptors acquired Carlos Delfino in a trade with Detroit for two second round draft picks,  and signed Jamario Moon  and three-point specialist Jason Kapono as free agents.  On the other hand, veteran swingman Morris Peterson joined the New Orleans Hornets .  Despite being defending division champions, the Raptors were widely tipped as outside contenders for the division and conference titles.  However, Toronto quickly fell behind Boston in the division, as Bargnani's inability to play well consistently, along with injuries to Garbajosa (75 games), Bosh (15 games) and Ford (31 games), derailed the possibility of a smooth campaign as the Raptors finished 41-41, six fewer wins than the previous season, but still good enough for a playoff spot as the 6th seed. They were pitted against Dwight Howard and the resurgent Orlando Magic . In Game 1, Dwight Howard gave the Magic their first playoff win since 2003 as they practically led the entire game.  Howard would put up a 29–20 in Game 2, as Hedo Türkoğlu scored the final four go-ahead points to give the Magic a 2–0 lead. The Raptors would respond with a strong Game 3 victory keyed by great point guard play from Ford and José Calderon . However, Jameer Nelson , Rashard Lewis and Keith Bogans keyed strong three point shooting in Game 4 and overcame Bosh's 39 points and 15 rebounds to bring the Magic out of Toronto with a 3–1 lead. Howard would finish off the series in Game 5 as impressively as he started–21 points, 21 rebounds, 3 blocks.   Whereas the preceding season was considered a success, the 2007–08 campaign was considered a disappointment. Weaknesses in Toronto's game—rebounding, defence, and a lack of a swingman—were brought into sharp focus during the playoffs, and changes were expected to be made to the roster.  , As it turned out, a blockbuster trade was agreed in principle before the 2008–09 campaign : six-time All-Star Jermaine O'Neal was acquired from the Indiana Pacers in exchange for Ford (who had become expendable with the emergence of Calderón), Rasho Nesterović , Maceo Baston , and Roy Hibbert , the 17th pick in the 2008 NBA draft , giving the Raptors a potential boost in the frontcourt.  Meanwhile, Bargnani, who had spent the summer working on his interior game, was projected to come off the bench. The Raptors also introduced a black alternate road jersey for the season similar to the earlier purple design that was dropped a few seasons ago. It had a maple leaf featured on the back neck of the jersey, symbolizing the Raptors as "Canada's team".  Despite the introduction of O'Neal, who brought home the rebounds and the blocks, and a much improved Bargnani, the Raptors were too inconsistent. Following an 8–9 start to the season, Mitchell was fired and replaced by long-time assistant Jay Triano .  Triano tweaked with the starting line-up to no avail as the Raptors fell to 21–34 prior to the All-Star break. O'Neal and Moon were then traded to Miami for Shawn Marion and Marcus Banks ,  but with the losses mounting, the Raptors soon fell out of the playoffs picture, and were eliminated from contention with seven games of the regular season remaining.  The Raptors eventually finished with a 33–49 record  and headed into the next season with a potential overhaul of the core: Marion could become a free agent; Bosh could become one after 2009–10; Parker would soon turn 35; and Bargnani had his breakthrough season. On May 12, 2009, Triano was given a three-year term for the position of head coach.  , The inevitable roster shakeup for the 2009–10 season began when Kapono was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers for the aggressive veteran forward Reggie Evans .  Toronto then drafted DeMar DeRozan with the ninth pick, enabling them to fill a spot on the wings.  This was followed by the signing of free agent Hedo Türkoğlu, which in turn led to a sign-and-trade agreement involving four teams, with Toronto landing wing players Devean George (later traded for Marco Belinelli ) and Antoine Wright , while releasing Marion, Kris Humphries and Nathan Jawai .  Around the same time, Parker headed for the Cleveland Cavaliers ,  while Indiana point guard Jarrett Jack was added and Nesterovič brought back to provide cover for the big men. Finally, Delfino and Ukić were moved to the Milwaukee Bucks for Amir Johnson and Sonny Weems .  It became increasingly clear that Colangelo, in securing a credible nucleus for the future, was doing this to persuade Bosh to stay beyond 2010.  While the Raptors were off to a sluggish start, they picked up the pace around the All-Star break, reaching a season-high seven games above .500 and standing fifth in the Eastern Conference.  Bosh was recording career-highs in ppg and rpg.  However, a season-ending injury to Bosh after the break coincided with Toronto's descent down the standings from the fifth seed to the eighth, and they ultimately relinquished their spot to Chicago a few games before the regular season ended.  , Before the 2010–11 season began, there was much anticipation around the league over the fates of an elite pack of free agents, featuring the likes of Bosh, Dwyane Wade , LeBron James , and Amar'e Stoudemire . Bosh and James eventually chose to converge in Miami with Wade, and the sign-and-trade transaction that ensued resulted in the Raptors receiving two first-round draft picks and a trade exception from Miami.  Prior to this, Toronto had drafted Ed Davis , also a left-handed power forward like Bosh. After Bosh left, Colangelo sought to trade Calderón, Evans and the disenchanted Türkoğlu for Tyson Chandler , Leandro Barbosa , and Boris Diaw ,  but the trade involving Chandler collapsed at the last minute, as Chandler was traded to the Dallas Mavericks instead.  Belinelli was then traded to New Orleans Hornets for Julian Wright ,  and 13 games into the season, Jack, David Andersen , and Marcus Banks to New Orleans for Peja Stojaković and Jerryd Bayless .  Bosh's first return to Toronto was received to a chorus of boos, but not as nearly as harsh as what former Raptors Tracy McGrady and Vince Carter received upon their respective returns.  Without Bosh, Toronto as a team regressed and were only able to secure 22 wins in the regular season. , Dwane Casey , an assistant coach with the Mavericks, was hired as the new head coach of Toronto before the 2011–12 season .  The Raptors used their number five pick to select Jonas Valančiūnas , a centre from Lithuania in the 2011 NBA draft . The season was shortened by 16 regular season games due to the 2011 NBA lockout , and the Raptors finished the season with a 23–43 record. During the 2012 off-season, Colangelo tried to lure Canadian free agent and two-time MVP Steve Nash , who had become a free agent after playing for the Phoenix Suns , to play for the Raptors. When Nash joined the Los Angeles Lakers instead, the Raptors acquired point guard Kyle Lowry from the Houston Rockets for a future first round pick. Lowry, combined with Valančiūnas and the 8th pick in the 2012 draft Terrence Ross , represented the next phase of the re-building process. On 30 January 2013, the Raptors acquired Memphis Grizzlies star Rudy Gay and centre Hamed Haddadi as well as Pistons player Austin Daye in a three-way deal that sent Calderón to the Detroit Pistons and Davis, along with Pistons veteran Tayshaun Prince and a 2nd round pick to the Grizzlies. Haddadi was later traded, along with a second round pick, to Phoenix in exchange for guard Sebastian Telfair . The 2012–13 season was the first season since 2009–10 that the Raptors finished the season with a winning home record (21–20), despite their overall losing record (34–48). , During the 2013 off-season, new General Manager Masai Ujiri traded Bargnani to the New York Knicks for Marcus Camby , Steve Novak , Quentin Richardson , a future first round draft pick, and two future second round picks; Camby and Richardson were both waived shortly after the trade. The Raptors also added Tyler Hansbrough , D. J. Augustin , Dwight Buycks , and Austin Daye via free agency. On 9 December 2013, the Raptors traded Rudy Gay , Quincy Acy , and Aaron Gray to the Sacramento Kings for John Salmons , Greivis Vásquez , Patrick Patterson , and Chuck Hayes , and waived Augustin.  During the 2013–14 season , the Raptors were 6–12 before the Rudy Gay trade; after the trade, they went on a 10–3 run as they maintained their lead in the division, and rose above the .500 mark for the first time in almost three years. , The Raptors entered the All-Star break with a 28–24 record, and DeRozan was also selected to play in the All-Star game, being only the fourth ever Raptor to do so. On March 28, 2014, the Raptors clinched a playoff berth for the first time since 2008 after beating the Boston Celtics 105–103.  On April 11, 2014, the Raptors lost to the New York Knicks 108–100, but since division rival Brooklyn lost to the Atlanta Hawks the same night, the Raptors became Atlantic Division champions for the first time since 2007.  They finished the regular season with a franchise-high 48 wins (.585), going 42–22 (.656) after the Rudy Gay trade, the third-best record in the Eastern Conference. The Raptors faced the Brooklyn Nets in the first round of the playoffs for the first time since 2007, when the Nets where located in New Jersey. Toronto nearly advanced to the next round, but Paul Pierce blocked a potential game-winner by Lowry in Game 7.  , In the summer of 2014, it was revealed that the Raptors were in discussion with the Rochester Razorsharks of the Premier Basketball League about forming a partnership in which the team would join the D-League and serve as the Raptors' exclusive affiliate at the 2015–16 season at the earliest.  During the 2014–15 season , the Raptors were off to their best start in franchise history: a then- Eastern Conference leading 24–8 record by the end of 2014.  , On 27 March 2015, the Raptors clinched the Atlantic division title with a 94–83 win over the Los Angeles Lakers . This was the second consecutive year when the Raptors clinched the Atlantic division title.  On 11 April 2015, the Raptors beat the Miami Heat, Toronto’s first road win over the Heat since 19 November 2008, ending a 10-game slide on Miami’s home floor. The win was Toronto’s 48th of the season and 22nd on the road, both tying franchise records.  On 15 April 2015, the Toronto Raptors broke their franchise record with their 49th win of the season. The Raptors faced the Washington Wizards in the first round of the 2015 playoffs, but the Wizards swept the Raptors in a 4–0 series. , The current Toronto Raptors logo (2015–present) , The second Toronto Raptors logo (2008–15); this logo removed the colour purple and replaced it with the colour red. , The original Toronto Raptors logo (1995–2008). , The red version of the alternate logo, with a red circle around it (2006–15). , The alternate Raptors logo (1995–2006), featuring three claws and a basketball that doubles as a stylized palm, was also used as part of the Raptors' tenth anniversary logo. Purple was the primary colour used by the Raptors, until it was replaced by red prior to the 2006–07 season. , Occasionally, the Raptors would wear the Toronto Huskies throwback jersey during retro nights, given that the Huskies are the unofficial predecessor of the Raptors. , The following players have rights owned by the Toronto Raptors. , General managers , Owners , Head coaches , Notes , Since their inception in 1995, the Raptors have made the playoffs seven times (2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008, 2014, and 2015), advancing past the first round just once (2001, when they were eliminated in the Conference Semifinals). The Raptors have won the Atlantic Division three times (2007, 2014, and 2015), and the franchise record number of wins in the regular season is 49 (2015). Five Raptors have been selected to play in the All-Star game : Vince Carter , Antonio Davis, Chris Bosh, DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry . , Raptors games are primarily broadcast on television by TSN and Sportsnet . Through MLSE, the Raptors also operate the Canadian version of NBA TV (formerly known as Raptors NBA TV), which airs reruns of Raptors telecasts along with other news and analysis programs focusing on the team and the rest of the NBA.  , Television , Radio , The Raptors have enjoyed a consistent fanbase throughout their history. The Toronto Raptors set NBA attendance records in their 2000, 2001, 2002 seasons when they made the playoffs. Attendance dipped slightly between 2003 and 2006. This improved during the 2006–07 regular season to an average of 18,258 fans (13th in the league), 92.2% of capacity at the ACC.  Following the success of the 2006–07 season, Toronto became one of the league leaders in season ticket sales for the 2007–08 season.  Their television ratings, however, are considerably lower than other more established Toronto sports teams and most other sporting events shown on Canadian television.  , The value of the Raptors franchise has risen over the years. In 1998, the franchise was bought for US$125 million. With the continued popularity of the Raptors, the value of the franchise doubled from US$148 million in 2000 to $297 million in 2004. The value of the franchise grew again from $315 million in 2006 to $373 million in 2007, and $400 million in 2008, before falling to $386 million in 2009. In 2010, the value of the franchise was $399 million, according to reports by Forbes .      , On game day, the fans are usually entertained by the Raptor mascot , the Raptors Dance Pak, and the 4 Korners Raptors Soundcrew during pre-game, time-outs , and intervals. During the 2013–14 season, a new " Drake Zone" was created in the lower bowl. Limited edition shirts were given away to fans sitting in the Drake Zone. Giveaways are sometimes bundled with tickets to encourage attendance. Further, whenever Toronto scores more than 100 points in a home game and wins, fans can redeem their ticket for a cheese or pepperoni pizza slice at standalone Pizza Pizza locations throughout Ontario for the business day after the game that was played. This is part of a promotion made by the Raptors' official pizza sponsor.  , In the lead-up to the team's 20th anniversary season in 2015, and its hosting of the 2016 All-Star Game, the Raptors began the process of re-branding itself. On September 30, 2013, Toronto-based rapper Drake was announced as the new "global ambassador" for the Toronto Raptors, thereby joining the executive committee of his hometown's NBA team.  In April 2014, the Raptors unveiled a new imaging campaign developed by the agency Sid Lee , "We The North", built around a manifesto that was meant to embrace the team's trait of being an "outsider" from the "north side", and the accompanying feelings of players and fans.  , The "We The North" campaign was originally to be launched during the 2015-16 season; however, the launch was hastened so it would be ready in time for the 2014 playoffs, taking into account the poor performance of Canada's other pro sports teams at the time. An introductory commercial was quickly filmed, which featured the manifesto as narration, scenes of local basketball players in various outdoor locations around the city, and ended with a scene displaying a black, waving flag with the motto written on it. The campaign was immediately embraced by fans during the playoffs and following season; the launch commercial was viewed over half a million times in the two days following its release, "We The North"-branded shirts and flags became a common sight at games, while Ryerson University sports marketing professor Cheri Bradish compared the campaign to Molson 's former " I Am Canadian " alcohol advertising campaign it how it resonated with the country.   , On December 19, 2014, the Raptors soft launched a new logo also designed by Sid Lee, which features a basketball with claw marks. The new logo will be officially implemented for the 2015-16 season.  The logo's introduction was marred by a disorganized launch, which saw a black and white version initially shown before the eventual unveiling of colored versions later in the day, mixed reviews for the design itself, with some (especially on the black and white version) comparing it to that of the Brooklyn Nets , and despite teasing merchandise with the new logo, not releasing any until at least mid-2015.  There were also alleged tensions between MLSE staff and Drake surrounding the new design—in particular, the performer had pushed for the team to change its primary color from red to gold (a color seen in one of the official variants of the logo unveiled that day). In a response on Twitter, Drake distanced himself from the "execution" of the new logo.  , The New Jersey/Brooklyn Nets and the Raptors have been minor rivals since the trade of Vince Carter to the Nets during the 2004–05 season . The rivalry began to heat up as the two teams faced each other in the opening round of the 2007 NBA Playoffs , with the Nets winning the series 4–2 after a go-ahead shot by Richard Jefferson with 8 seconds left in Game 6 ensuring 98–97 defeat for the Raptors. The rivalry was rekindled during the 2013–14 season when the Nets and Raptors battled for the Atlantic Division. The Raptors won the division final but then they found themselves facing the Nets in the opening round of the 2014 NBA Playoffs . Prior to Game 1 of the series, Raptors GM Masai Ujiri spoke at a Raptors rally outside Air Canada Centre 's Maple Leaf Square . During the rally, Ujiri yelled "F**k Brooklyn!" which found its way quickly onto social media platforms within minutes. Masai was fined $25,000 by the NBA for the quote and later apologized for the excessive language. The hard fought series lasted seven games, and was decided in the final seconds when Paul Pierce blocked Kyle Lowry 's shot giving the Nets the 104–103 victory. , The New York Knicks and the Raptors had a playoff rivalry in 2000 and 2001 . The Raptors made their first-ever playoff appearance during the 1999–2000 season , in which they were swept by the Knicks in the first round 3–0. The following season , the Raptors redeemed themselves, defeating the Knicks in the first round 3–2; this effectively ended the Knicks' run as perennial NBA championship contenders, which began in the early 1990s. , The Raptors Foundation was the charitable arm of the Raptors, dedicated to assisting Ontario's registered charities that support programs and sports initiatives for at-risk children and youth. The Foundation strove to lift spirits and change lives for young people by supporting local and provincial organizations that provide recreational, educational and other youth-oriented activities. Through its community ties and with the help of its corporate partners, donors, Raptors players and volunteers, the Foundation has successfully raised more than $14 million between 1995 and 2007, and reached out to thousands of other charities.  The Raptors Foundation was one of three parts of the Raptors' community service program. The other projects are Raptors Community Relations and Raptors Basketball Development, both of which focus on providing basketball development programs. The Toronto Raptors lead the NBA for amount of money donated to the community. In 2009, the Raptors Foundation merged with the other charitable arms of MLSE's other sports franchises to form the Team Up Foundation.    The Chicago Bulls are an American professional basketball team based in Chicago , Illinois , playing in the Central Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The team was founded on January 16, 1966. The Bulls play their home games at the United Center . The Bulls saw their greatest success during the 1990s. They are known for having one of the NBA's greatest dynasties, winning six NBA championships between 1991 and 1998 with two three-peats . All six championship teams were led by Hall of Famers Michael Jordan , Scottie Pippen and coach Phil Jackson . The Bulls are the only NBA franchise to win multiple championships and never lose an NBA Finals in their history. , The Bulls won an NBA record -72 games during the 1995–96 NBA season and are the only team in NBA history to win 70 games or more in a single season.   Many experts and analysts consider the 1996 Bulls to be one of the greatest teams in NBA history. As of 2013, the Bulls were estimated to be the third most valuable NBA franchise according to Forbes , with an estimated value of $1 billion, earning an estimated $52.2 million in operating income in 2013.  Michael Jordan and Derrick Rose have both won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award while playing for the Bulls, for a total of six MVP awards. , The Bulls share rivalries with the Milwaukee Bucks , Detroit Pistons , New York Knicks , and more recently the Indiana Pacers , Miami Heat , and Cleveland Cavaliers . The Bulls-Pistons rivalry was highlighted heavily during the late 1980s and early 1990s. , , , On January 16, 1966 Chicago was granted an NBA franchise to be called the Bulls. The Chicago Bulls became the third NBA franchise in the city, after the Chicago Stags (1946–50) and the Chicago Packers–Zephyrs (now the Washington Wizards ). The Bulls' founder, Dick Klein , was the Bulls' only owner to ever play professional basketball (for the Chicago American Gears ). He served as the Bulls' president and general manager in their initial years. , After the 1966 NBA Expansion Draft , the newly founded Chicago Bulls were allowed to acquire players from the previously established teams in the league for the upcoming 1966–67 season. The team started in the 1966–67 NBA season , and posted the best record by an expansion team in NBA history. Coached by Chicagoan and former NBA star Johnny "Red" Kerr , and led by former NBA assist leader Guy Rodgers , shooting guard Jerry Sloan and forward Bob Boozer , the Bulls qualified for the playoffs, the only NBA team to do so in their first season. , In their first two seasons, the Bulls played most of their home games at the International Amphitheatre , before moving to Chicago Stadium . , Fan interest was diminishing after four seasons, with one game in the 1967-68 NBA season having an official attendance of 891 and some games being played in Kansas City . In 1969, Klein dropped out of the general manager job and invited Pat Williams , who as the Philadelphia 76ers ' business manager created promotions that helped the team become third in attendance the previous season. Williams revamped the team roster, acquiring Chet Walker from his old team in exchange for Jim Washington and drafting Norm Van Lier - who was traded to the Cincinnati Royals and only joined the Bulls in 1971 - while also investing in promotion, with actions such as creating mascot Benny the Bull . The Bulls under Williams and head coach Dick Motta qualified for four straight playoffs and had attendances grow to over 10,000.  In 1972, the Bulls set a franchise win-loss record at 57 wins and 25 losses. During the 1970s, the Bulls relied on Jerry Sloan , forwards Bob Love and Chet Walker , point guard Norm Van Lier , and centers Clifford Ray and Tom Boerwinkle . The team made the conference finals in 1975 but lost to the Golden State Warriors , 4 games to 3. , After four 50-win seasons, Williams returned to Philadelphia, and Motta decided to become GM as well. The Bulls ended up declining, winning only 24 games in the 1975–1976 season. Motta was fired and replaced by Ed Badger .  , Artis Gilmore , acquired in the ABA dispersal draft in 1976, led a Bulls squad which included guard Reggie Theus , forward David Greenwood and forward Orlando Woolridge . , In 1979, the Bulls lost a coin flip for the right to select first in the NBA draft ( Rod Thorn , the Bulls' General Manager, called "heads"). Had the Bulls won the toss, they would have selected Magic Johnson ; instead, they selected David Greenwood with the second pick. The Los Angeles Lakers selected Johnson with the pick acquired from the New Orleans Jazz , who traded the selection for Gail Goodrich . , After Gilmore was traded to the San Antonio Spurs for center Dave Corzine , the Bulls employed a high-powered offense centered around Theus, and which soon included guards Quintin Dailey and Ennis Whatley . However, with continued dismal results, the Bulls decided to change direction, trading Theus to the Kansas City Kings during the 1983–84 season . , In the summer of 1984, the Bulls had the third pick of the 1984 NBA Draft , after Houston and Portland. The Rockets selected Hakeem Olajuwon , the Blazers picked Sam Bowie and the Bulls chose shooting guard Michael Jordan . The team, with new management in owner Jerry Reinsdorf and general manager Jerry Krause , decided to rebuild around Jordan. Jordan set franchise records during his rookie campaign for scoring (third in the league) and steals (fourth), and led the Bulls back to the playoffs , where they lost in four games to the Milwaukee Bucks . For his efforts, he was rewarded with a selection to the All-NBA Second Team and the NBA Rookie of the Year Award. , In the following off-season, the team acquired point guard John Paxson and on draft day traded with the Cavaliers for the rights to power forward Charles Oakley . Along with Jordan and center Dave Corzine , they provided much of the Bulls' offense for the next two years. After suffering a broken foot early in the 1985–86 season , Jordan finished second on the team to Woolridge in scoring. Jordan returned for the playoffs , and took the eighth-place Bulls against the 67–15 Boston Celtics , led by Larry Bird . At the time, the Bulls had the fifth worst record of any team to qualify for the playoffs in NBA history.  Though the Bulls were swept, Jordan recorded a playoff single-game record 63 points in Game 2 (which still stands to this day), prompting Bird to call him 'God disguised as Michael Jordan.' , In the 1986–87 NBA season , Jordan continued his assault on the record books, leading the league in scoring with 37.1 points per game and becoming the first Bull named to the All-NBA First Team. The Bulls finished 40–42, which was good enough to qualify them for the playoffs. However, they were again swept by the Celtics in the playoffs . In the 1987 draft , to address their lack of depth, Krause selected center Olden Polynice eighth overall and power forward Horace Grant 10th overall, then sent Polynice to Seattle in a draft-day trade for the fifth selection, small forward Scottie Pippen . With Paxson and Jordan in the backcourt, Brad Sellers and Oakley at the forward spots, Corzine anchoring center, and rookies Pippen and Grant coming off the bench, the Bulls won 50 games and advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals, where they were beaten by the eventual Eastern Conference Champions Detroit Pistons in five games. For his efforts, Jordan was named NBA Most Valuable Player , an award he would win four more times over his career. The 1987–88 season would also mark the start of the Pistons-Bulls rivalry which was formed from 1988 to 1991. , The 1988–89 season marked a second straight year of major off-season moves. Power forward Charles Oakley , who had led the league in total rebounds in both '87 and '88, was traded on the eve of the 1988 NBA draft to the New York Knicks along with a first round draft pick used by the Knicks to select Rod Strickland for center Bill Cartwright and a first round pick, which the Bulls used to obtain center Will Perdue . In addition, the Bulls acquired three-point shooter Craig Hodges from Phoenix. The new starting lineup of Paxson, Jordan, Pippen, Grant, and Cartwright took some time to mesh, winning fewer games than the previous season, but made it all the way to the Eastern Conference Finals, where they were defeated in six games by the NBA champion Pistons. , In 1989–90 , Jordan led the league in scoring for the fourth straight season, and was joined on the all-star squad for the first time by Pippen. There was also a major change during the off-season, where head coach Doug Collins was replaced by assistant coach Phil Jackson . The Bulls also picked up rookie center Stacey King and rookie point guard B.J. Armstrong in the 1989 draft . With these additional players and the previous year's starting five, the Bulls again made it to the Conference Finals, and pushed the Pistons to seven games before being eliminated for the third straight year, the Pistons going on to repeat as NBA champions. , In the 1990–91 season , the Bulls recorded a then-franchise record 61 wins, and romped through the playoffs , where they swept the defending champion Pistons in the Conference Finals and won the NBA Finals in five games over the Magic Johnson -led Los Angeles Lakers . , The Bulls won their second straight title in 1992 after racking up another franchise record for wins with 67. They defeated the Portland Trail Blazers in six games. , In 1993 , the Bulls won a third consecutive championship over regular season MVP Charles Barkley and the Phoenix Suns , with John Paxson's three-pointer with 3.9 seconds left giving them a 99–98 victory in Game 6 in Phoenix, Arizona . , On October 6, 1993, Michael Jordan shocked the basketball community by announcing his retirement, three months after his father's murder . The Bulls were then led by Scottie Pippen , who established himself as one of the top players in the league by winning the 1994 All-Star MVP. He received help from Horace Grant and B.J. Armstrong , who were named to their first all-star games. The three were assisted by Cartwright , Perdue , shooting guard Pete Myers , and Croatian rookie forward Toni Kukoč . Despite the Bulls winning 55 games during the 1993–94 season , they were beaten in seven games by the Knicks in the second round of the playoffs , after a controversial foul call by referee Hue Hollins in game 5 of that series. The Knicks eventually reached the finals that year, but lost to the Houston Rockets . The Bulls opened the 1994–95 season by leaving their home of 27 years, Chicago Stadium , and moving into their current home, the United Center . , In 1994, the Bulls lost Grant, Cartwright and Scott Williams to free agency, and John Paxson to retirement, but picked up shooting guard Ron Harper , the seeming heir apparent to Jordan in assistant coach Tex Winter 's triple-post offense, and small-forward Jud Buechler . The Bulls started Armstrong and Harper in the backcourt, Pippen and Kukoc at the forward spots, and Perdue at center. They also had sharpshooter Steve Kerr , whom they acquired via free agency before the 1993–94 season, Myers, and centers Luc Longley (acquired via trade in 1994 from the Minnesota Timberwolves) and Bill Wennington . However, they were struggling during the season, on March 18, 1995, they received the news that Michael Jordan was coming out of retirement. He scored 55 points against the Knicks in only his fifth game back, and led the Bulls to the fifth seed in the playoffs , where they defeated the Charlotte Hornets. However, Jordan and the Bulls were unable to overcome the eventual Eastern Conference champion Orlando Magic , which included Horace Grant , Anfernee Hardaway , and Shaquille O'Neal . When Jordan returned to the Bulls, he initially wore No. 45 (which was his number while playing for the Birmingham Barons , a minor-league affiliate of the Chicago White Sox ). He chose the No. 45 because his older brother Larry wore that number in high school. Michael wanted to be half as good as his brother so he chose 23 which is half of 45 (22.5) rounded up. However, Jordan switched back to the familiar 23 before game 2 of the Orlando Magic series. , In the off-season, the Bulls lost Armstrong in the expansion draft, and Krause traded Perdue to the San Antonio Spurs for rebounding specialist Dennis Rodman , who had won the past four rebounding titles, and who had also been a member of the Detroit Pistons ' "Bad Boys" squad that served as the Bulls' chief nemesis in the late 1980s. , With a lineup of Harper, Jordan, Pippen, Rodman and Longley, and perhaps the league's best bench in Kerr, Kukoc, Wennington, Buechler, and guard Randy Brown the Bulls posted one of the best single-season improvements in league history and the best single-season record, moving from 47–35 to 72–10, becoming the only NBA team to date to win more than 70 games.  Jordan won his eighth scoring title, and Rodman his fifth straight rebounding title, while Kerr finished second in the league in three-point shooting percentage. Jordan garnered the elusive triple crown with the regular season MVP, All-star Game MVP, and Finals MVP. Krause was named Executive of the Year, Jackson Coach of the Year, and Kukoc the Sixth Man of the Year. Both Pippen and Jordan made the All-NBA First Team, and Jordan, Pippen, and Rodman made the All-Defensive First Team, making the Bulls the only team in history with three players on the All-Defensive First Team.  , In addition, the 1995–96 team holds several other records, including the best road record in a standard 41-road-game season (33–8), the all-time best start by a team (41–3), the longest home winning streak (44 games, 7 from previous season), and the best start at home (37–0). The Bulls also posted the second-best home record in history (39–2), behind only the 1985–86 Celtics 40–1 home mark, and the second-best point differential in history, trailing the 1972 Lakers by 3 points over the course of an entire season. The team triumphed over Gary Payton , Shawn Kemp and the Seattle SuperSonics for their fourth title . The 1995–96 Chicago Bulls are widely regarded as one of the greatest teams in the history of basketball .  , In the 1996–97 season , the Bulls narrowly missed out on a second consecutive 70-win season by losing their final two games to finish 69–13. They repeated their home dominance, going 39–2 at the United Center.  The Bulls capped the season by winning their fifth NBA championship over John Stockton , Karl Malone and the Utah Jazz . Jordan earned his second straight and ninth career scoring title, while Rodman earned his sixth straight rebounding title. Jordan and Pippen, along with Robert Parish , who was a member of the Bulls at the time, were also honored as members of the 50 greatest players of all-time with the NBA celebrating its 50th season.  Parish, whose single season with the Bulls would be his last year in the league, was nominated for his stellar career with the Boston Celtics .  , The 1997–98 season was one of turmoil for the NBA champion Bulls.  Many speculated this would be Michael Jordan's final season with the team.  Phil Jackson's future with the team was also questionable, as his relationship with team general manager Jerry Krause was one of growing tension. Scottie Pippen was looking for a significant contract extension that he thought he deserved, but was not getting from the organization. In spite of the turmoil that surrounded the Bulls, they still had a remarkable season, with a final regular-season record of 62–20. Michael Jordan would be named the league MVP for the fifth and final time, and the Bulls went into the playoffs as the number one seed in the Eastern Conference. , The first round of the playoffs for the Bulls was against the New Jersey Nets , a team led by Kendall Gill and Sam Cassell . The Bulls swept the Nets three to nothing in a best of five series. The conference semi-finals were more challenging with the Charlotte Hornets stealing game two from the Bulls at the United Center, and tying the series 1–1. But the Bulls easily defeated the Hornets in the next three games of the series. The Conference Finals was a challenge for the Bulls as they went up against the Reggie Miller -led Indiana Pacers . Experts were of the opinion that the Pacers had the best chance to defeat the Bulls.  The Pacers gave the Bulls no road wins, winning games 3, 4, and 6, sending the series to a deciding game seven at the United Center. The Bulls prevailed and beat the Pacers 88–83, winning their 6th Eastern Conference Championship. , In a much anticipated Finals, The Bulls faced the team they beat the previous year, the Utah Jazz . Led by Karl Malone and John Stockton , the Jazz felt confident that they could defeat the Bulls, winning game one at Utah's Delta Center. Facing a potential two to nothing deficit, the Bulls won Game 2 at the Delta Center and tied the series. The Bulls returned to the United Center and, by winning the next two games, took a 3–1 series lead. The Jazz won Game 5 by two points, 83–81. Game 6 was a tough battle for both teams, as the Jazz had a lead late in the game. Down by three points to the Jazz, Michael Jordan led the Bulls to one final win. Jordan hit a shot to bring the Bulls within 1, then stole the ball from Karl Malone and hit the game winning shot with 5.2 seconds remaining on the clock. With a score of 87–86, John Stockton put up a three-pointer, but missed, giving the Bulls their sixth championship in eight years. Jordan would be named the Finals MVP for the sixth time in his career. He retired for the second time on January 13, 1999. , The summer of 1998 brought an abrupt end to the championship era.  Krause felt that the Bulls were on the verge of being too old and unable to compete. He decided that the team's only choices were to rebuild or endure a slow decline. His plan was to trade away the aging talent and acquire high draft picks while clearing salary cap space to make a run at several promising free agents in two years' time. After having been vetoed in a previous attempt by owner Jerry Reinsdorf , Krause traded Scottie Pippen for Roy Rogers (who was released in February 1999) and a conditional second-round draft pick from the Houston Rockets. He also decided not to re-sign Dennis Rodman , and traded Luc Longley and Steve Kerr for other draft picks. He hired a new coach, Tim Floyd , who had run a successful program at Iowa State University . Upon Phil Jackson's departure, Michael Jordan made his second retirement official. With a new starting lineup of point guard Randy Brown, shooting guard Ron Harper , newcomer Brent Barry at small forward, power forward Toni Kukoc, and center Bill Wennington, the team began the lockout -shortened 1998–99 season . Kukoc led the team in scoring, rebounding, and assists, but the team won only 13 of 50 games. The lowest point of the season came on April 10 in a game against the Miami Heat. In that game, the Bulls scored 49 points to set an NBA record for the fewest points in a game in the shot clock era. , The previous year's dismal finish came with one highlight: the team won the draft lottery and the rights to power forward Elton Brand . Since the team lost Harper, Wennington and Barry in the offseason, Brand and fellow rookie Ron Artest led the team throughout the year, especially after Kukoc missed most of the season due to injury and was then dealt for a draft pick at the trading deadline. Brand recorded the first 20–10 average for the Bulls since the days of Artis Gilmore . He led all rookies in scoring, rebounds , blocks, field goal percentage and minutes, while Artest led all rookies in steals and finished second on the team in scoring. For his efforts Brand was named 1999–2000 co- Rookie of the Year with Houston 's Steve Francis , and to the all-rookie first team, while Artest was named to the all-rookie second team. However, the team established a franchise low at 17–65, second worst in the league. , After a summer in which the Bulls witnessed most major and minor free agents Tim Duncan , Grant Hill , Tracy McGrady , Eddie Jones and even Tim Thomas choose to stay with their teams (or go elsewhere) rather than sign with them, Krause signed free agent center Brad Miller and shooting guard Ron Mercer , and drafted power forward Marcus Fizer and traded draft pick Chris Mihm to Cleveland for the rights of guard Jamal Crawford . Brand again led the team in scoring and rebounds with another 20–10 season, but the new acquisitions failed to make a major impact, and they finished with the worst record in team history and the league's worst for the season at 15–67. , Krause shocked Bulls fans on draft day in 2001 when he traded franchise player Brand to the Los Angeles Clippers for the second pick in the draft, Tyson Chandler . He also selected Eddy Curry with the fourth pick. Since both Chandler and Curry came straight out of high school, neither was expected to make much of a contribution for several years, but they were seen as potential franchise players. The team floundered without veteran leadership. At mid-season, the Bulls traded their top three scorers—Mercer, Artest , and Miller along with Kevin Ollie—to the Indiana Pacers for veteran guard Jalen Rose , Travis Best and Norman Richardson. There was also a change in coaching, with Floyd being dismissed in favor of assistant coach and former Bulls co-captain Bill Cartwright, following a series of arguments with players and management. The Bulls improved from 15 to 21 wins, although they were still tied for last in the league. , For the 2002–03 season , the Bulls came to play with much optimism. They picked up college phenom Jay Williams with the second pick in the draft . Williams teamed with Jalen Rose, Crawford, Fizer, newcomer Donyell Marshall , Curry, Chandler, and guard Trenton Hassell to form a young and exciting nucleus which improved to 30–52 in Bill Cartwright's first full season as head coach . Curry led the league in field goal percentage, becoming the first Bull since Jordan to lead the league in a major statistical category. , During the summer of 2003, long-time GM Jerry Krause retired, and former player and color commentator John Paxson was tapped as his successor. Jay Williams, coming off a promising rookie campaign, was seriously injured in a motorcycle accident. His contract was bought out by the Bulls in February 2004 and he has yet to return to the game. Paxson selected point guard Kirk Hinrich with the seventh pick in the draft, and signed veteran free agent and former franchise player Scottie Pippen. With Pippen playing, Cartwright at the sidelines, and Paxson in the front office , the Bulls hoped that some of the championship magic from before would return. , However, the 2003–04 season was a resounding disappointment. Eddy Curry regressed, leading to questions about his conditioning and commitment. Tyson Chandler was plagued by a chronic back injury, missing more than thirty games. Pippen's ability to influence games was impaired by knee problems, and he openly contemplated retirement. Jamal Crawford remained inconsistent. Bill Cartwright was fired as head coach in December and replaced with former Phoenix coach Scott Skiles . A trade with the Toronto Raptors brought Antonio Davis and Jerome Williams in exchange for Rose and Marshall in what was seen as a major shift in team strategy from winning with athleticism to winning with hard work and defense. After struggling throughout the season, the Bulls finished with 23 wins and 59 losses, the second-worst record in the league. Fizer was not re-signed, and Crawford was re-signed and traded to the Knicks for expiring contracts. Hinrich provided the lone bright spot, becoming a fan favorite for his gritty determination and tenacious defense. He won a place on the All-Rookie first team. , During the 2004 off-season, Paxson traded a 2005 draft pick to the Phoenix Suns in return for an additional pick in the 2004 NBA Draft . He used the picks to select Connecticut guard Ben Gordon and Duke small forward Luol Deng in the first round, and Duke point guard Chris Duhon in the second. Paxson also signed free agent small forward Andrés Nocioni , who had recently won an Olympic gold medal as a member of the Argentine national team . After losing the first nine games of the season, the Bulls began to show signs of improvement behind their improved team defense and clutch fourth-quarter play from Gordon. The Bulls, who were 0–9 to start the season, finished the regular season 47–35, with the third-best record in the Eastern Conference and advanced to the NBA playoffs for the first time since Jordan's departure. In the first round, the 4th-seeded Bulls played the Washington Wizards. The Bulls opened the series with two wins at home, but lost the next four games and the series. After the season, Ben Gordon became the first rookie to win the NBA Sixth Man Award and the first Bull to win the award since 1996 with Toni Kukoč . , During the 2005 off-season, the Bulls re-signed free agent Tyson Chandler . However, Curry showed possible symptoms of a heart disease resulting of a heart murmur during checkups, and Paxson would not clear him to play without extensive DNA testing. Ultimately, Curry refused to participate in the tests, and he was traded along with Antonio Davis to the New York Knicks for Michael Sweetney , Tim Thomas , and what became the second pick of the 2006 NBA Draft —as well as the right to swap picks with New York in the 2007 NBA Draft . , Without a significant post presence, the Bulls struggled for most of the 2005–06 season . However, a late-season 12–2 surge allowed them to finish 41–41 and qualify for the 2006 playoffs as the seventh seed. There, the Bulls faced the Miami Heat . After two close losses in Miami, the Bulls broke through with a blowout win in Game 3, and another win in Game 4. However, the Heat took the next two games to win the series and went on to win that year's championship. The Bulls' several young players nevertheless earned additional postseason experience, and Nocioni turned in a remarkable series of performances that far exceeded his season averages. , In the 2006 NBA Draft, the Bulls were awarded forward-center LaMarcus Aldridge and immediately traded him to the Portland Trail Blazers for forward Tyrus Thomas and forward Viktor Khryapa . In a second draft-day trade, the Bulls selected Rodney Carney and traded him to the Philadelphia 76ers for guard Thabo Sefolosha . Later that summer, four-time Defensive Player of the Year Ben Wallace signed with the Bulls for a reported four-year, $60 million contract. Following the signing of Wallace, the Bulls traded Tyson Chandler , the last remaining player of the Krause era, to the (then) New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets for veteran power forward P.J. Brown and J.R. Smith and salary cap space that was used to sign former Chicago co-captain Adrian Griffin . , In 2006–07, the Bulls overcame a 3–9 season start to finish 49–33, the third-best record in the Eastern Conference . In the first round, the Bulls again faced Miami , the defending NBA champions. The Bulls narrowly won Game 1 at home, then followed it with a blowout victory in Game 2. In Miami, the Bulls rallied from a 12-point second-half deficit to win Game 3 and then posted another comeback win in Game 4. The Bulls' four-game sweep of the defending champions stunned many NBA observers. It was Chicago's first playoff series victory since 1998, Jordan's last season with the team. , The Bulls then advanced to face the Detroit Pistons , marking the first time the Central Division rivals had met in the playoffs since 1991. The Pistons won the first three games including a big comeback in Game 3. No NBA team had ever come back from a 0–3 deficit to win the series, but the Bulls avoided a sweep by winning Game 4 by 10 points. The Bulls then easily won Game 5 in Detroit, and had a chance to make NBA history. But they lost at home in game 6 by 10, and the Pistons won the series 4–2 on May 17. , During the off season, the Bulls signed forward Joe Smith and guard Adrian Griffin , and drafted center Joakim Noah . However, distractions began when Luol Deng and Ben Gordon turned down contract extensions, never citing reasons. Then rumors surfaced that the Bulls were pursuing stars like Kevin Garnett , Pau Gasol , and most notably, Kobe Bryant . None of these deals happened, and general manager John Paxson denied a deal was ever imminent. , The Bulls started the 2007–08 NBA season by losing 10 of their first 12 games and on December 24, 2007, after a 9–16 start, the Bulls fired head coach Scott Skiles . Jim Boylan was named the interim head coach on December 27, 2007. , On February 21, 2008, Ben Wallace , Joe Smith , Adrian Griffin and the Bulls' 2009 2nd round draft pick  were exchanged for Drew Gooden , Cedric Simmons , Larry Hughes and Shannon Brown in a three-team trade deal involving the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Seattle SuperSonics .  Boylan was not retained on April 17 at the conclusion of the 2007–08 season after compiling a 24–32 record with the Bulls. The Bulls ended the 2007–08 campaign with a 33–49 record, a complete reversal of last year's record. , After Jim Boylan 's interim tenure expired, the Bulls began the process of selecting a new head coach. They were in talks with former Phoenix head coach Mike D'Antoni , but on May 10, 2008, he signed with the New York Knicks . Other possible options included former Dallas head coach Avery Johnson and former Bulls head coach Doug Collins . Collins resigned from the coaching list on June 4, 2008, reporting that he did not want to ruin his friendship with Jerry Reinsdorf . , On June 10, 2008, the Chicago Bulls G.M. John Paxson hired Vinny Del Negro , with no coaching experience, to coach the young Bulls. On July 3, 2008, the Chicago Tribune reported that Del Harris agreed to become an assistant coach for the Chicago Bulls along with former Charlotte Bobcats head coach Bernie Bickerstaff and longtime NBA assistant Bob Ociepka. Along with Bickerstaff and Ociepka, Harris helped establish a veteran presence on the coaching staff and helped rookie head coach Del Negro. , With a slim 1.7% chance of winning the rights to draft number 1, the Bulls won the 2008 NBA Draft Lottery and selected first overall. With this, the Bulls became the team with the lowest chance of winning to ever win the lottery since it was modified for the 1994 NBA Draft , and second lowest ever. On June 26, 2008, the Bulls drafted Chicago native Derrick Rose from the University of Memphis as the number 1 draft pick. At pick number 39 they selected Sonny Weems . The Bulls later traded Weems to the Denver Nuggets for Denver's 2009 regular second-round draft pick. The Bulls then acquired Ömer Aşık from the Portland Trail Blazers (selected with the 36th pick) for Denver's 2009 regular second-round draft pick, New York 's 2009 regular second-round draft pick, and the Bulls' 2010 regular second-round draft pick. The Bulls re-signed Luol Deng to a six-year $71 million contract on July 30, 2008. He was later plagued with an injury keeping him from action for most of the 2008–2009 season . Ben Gordon signed a one-year contract on October 2, 2008. , On February 18, 2009, the Bulls made their first of several trades, sending Andres Nocioni , Drew Gooden , Cedric Simmons ,and Michael Ruffin to the Sacramento Kings for Brad Miller and John Salmons .  Then on February 19, 2009, the NBA trade deadline, the Bulls traded Larry Hughes to the New York Knicks for Tim Thomas , Jerome James , and Anthony Roberson .  Later that day the Bulls made the third trade in a span of less than 24 hours by sending swingman Thabo Sefolosha to the Oklahoma City Thunder for a 2009 first-round pick.  The trades brought a late-season push for the Bulls, which finally clinched a playoff berth on April 10, 2009, their fourth in the last five years. They finished the season with a 41–41 record. Their record was good enough to secure a No. 7 seed in the 2009 NBA Playoffs , playing a tough series against the Boston Celtics . In Game 1, Derrick Rose scored 36 points, along with 11 assists, tying Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's record for most points scored by a rookie in a playoff debut. After breaking the record for most overtimes played in a NBA Playoffs Series, the Boston Celtics managed to overcome the Bulls after 7 games and 7 overtimes played.  , The Bulls had two 1st round picks in the 2009 NBA Draft and decided to take Wake Forest stand out forward James Johnson and athletic USC forward Taj Gibson .  In the 2009 NBA off-season the Bulls lost their leading scorer, Ben Gordon, when he signed with their divisional rival, the Detroit Pistons . , On February 18, 2010, John Salmons was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks for Joe Alexander and Hakim Warrick . Meanwhile, Tyrus Thomas was traded to the Charlotte Bobcats for Acie Law , Flip Murray and a future protected first round pick. On April 14, 2010, the Bulls clinched the playoffs with the number 8 seed. Unlike the previous year, however, the Bulls' playoff run was shorter and less dramatic as they were eliminated by the Cleveland Cavaliers in five games. On May 4, 2010, the Bulls officially fired head coach Vinny Del Negro.  , In early June 2010, Boston Celtics assistant Tom Thibodeau accepted a three-year contract to fill the Bulls' head coaching vacancy.  He was officially introduced on June 23.  On July 7, it was revealed that Carlos Boozer of the Utah Jazz had verbally agreed to an $80 million, five-year contract. Afterwards, the Bulls traded veteran point guard Kirk Hinrich to the Washington Wizards to create more cap space. The Bulls also signed former 76er and Jazz sharpshooter Kyle Korver to a three-year, $15 million contract. The same day that the Bulls signed Kyle Korver, they signed Turkish All-Star Ömer Aşık . After being matched by the Orlando Magic for J.J. Redick , they signed their third free agent from the Jazz in the off-season in shooting guard Ronnie Brewer , traded for former Warrior point guard C.J. Watson , and signed former Bucks power forward Kurt Thomas as well as former Spurs player Keith Bogans and former Celtic Brian Scalabrine . , Rose earned the 2011 NBA MVP Award, thereby becoming the youngest player in NBA history to win it. He became the first Bulls player since Michael Jordan to win the award. As a team, Chicago finished the regular season with a league-best 62–20 record and clinched the first seed in the Eastern Conference for the first time since 1998. The Bulls defeated the Indiana Pacers and the Atlanta Hawks in five and six games, respectively,thereby reaching the Eastern Conference finals for the first time since 1998, and faced the Miami Heat . After winning the first game of the series, they lost the next four games, ending their season. , During the off-season, the Bulls drafted Jimmy Butler 30th overall in the 2011 NBA draft. After the NBA lockout ended, the Bulls lost Kurt Thomas to free agency, and released Keith Bogans. The Bulls signed veteran shooting guard Richard "Rip" Hamilton to a three-year deal, after he was waived by the Detroit Pistons. The Bulls also gave MVP Derrick Rose a 5-year contract extension worth $94.8 million. , Derrick Rose was voted as a NBA All-Star starter for the second consecutive year, and was the third leading vote getter overall behind Dwight Howard and Kobe Bryant . Luol Deng was also selected as a reserve for the Eastern Conference. This was the first time that the Bulls had two all stars since 1997, when Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen were the duo. Derrick Rose was injured for most of the 2011–12 NBA season ; however, the team was still able to finish with a 50–16 record and clinched the first seed in the Eastern Conference for the second straight year and the best overall record in the NBA (tied with the San Antonio Spurs ). Rose suffered a new injury when he tore his ACL during the 4th quarter of the first playoff game on April 28, 2012, against the Philadelphia 76ers and missed the rest of the series. Head coach Tom Thibodeau was criticized for keeping Rose in the game even though the Bulls were essentially minutes away from their victory over the 76ers. The Bulls lost the next three games, and also lost Noah to a foot injury after he severely rolled his ankle stepping on Andre Iguodala 's foot in Game 3; he briefly returned for part of the fourth quarter of that game, but missed the following games in the series. After winning Game 5 at home, Bulls were eliminated by the 76ers in Game 6 in Philadelphia, becoming the fifth team in NBA history to be eliminated as a first seed by an eighth seed. In Game 6, Andre Iguodala sank two free throws with 2.2 seconds left to put the 76ers up 79-78 after getting fouled by Ömer Aşık , who had missed two free throws five seconds earlier. At the end of the season, Boozer and Aşık were the only members on the Bulls' roster to have played in every game, with Korver and Brewer missing one game apiece. In the offseason, the Bulls gave up Lucas to the Toronto Raptors , Brewer to the New York Knicks , Korver to the Atlanta Hawks , Watson to the Brooklyn Nets and Aşık to the Houston Rockets , but brought back Kirk Hinrich . In addition, they added Marco Belinelli , Vladimir Radmanovic , Nazr Mohammed and Nate Robinson to the roster via free agency. , Rose missed the entire 2012–13 season, but despite his absence, the Bulls finished 45-37, second in the Central Division (behind the Indiana Pacers ) and 5th in their conference. They defeated the Brooklyn Nets 4-3 (after leading 3-1) in the first round of the playoffs and lost to the Miami Heat 4–1 in the next round. , During the season, the Bulls snapped both Miami's 27-game winning streak and the New York Knicks' 13-game winning streak, becoming the second team in NBA history to snap two winning streaks of 13 games or more in a season. , Just 10 games into the 2013-14 season, Derrick Rose would tear his medial meniscus on a non-contact play. He declared he would miss the remainder of the season. On January 7, 2014, veteran forward Luol Deng was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers for center Andrew Bynum and a set of picks. Bynum was immediately waived after the trade went through. The Bulls would finish second in the Central Division with 48 wins, and earned home-court advantage in the first round. However, due to lack of a strong offensive weapon, they failed to win a single home game en route to losing to the Washington Wizards in five games. , In the 2014 NBA draft, the Bulls traded their #16 and #19 picks for Doug McDermott , the former Creighton star and 5th leading scorer in NCAA history, who was selected with the 11th pick, and in the second round, took Cameron Bairstow with the 49th pick. That offseason, they signed Pau Gasol , re-signed Kirk Hinrich and brought over Eurostar Nikola Mirotic , who was acquired via a draft day trade in 2011, but could not come over sooner due to salary cap constraints. , The second return of Derrick Rose gave the Bulls and their fans optimism for the 2014-2015 season. With 2-time NBA Champion Pau Gasol and a deep bench consisting of Taj Gibson , Nikola Mirotic , Tony Snell , Aaron Brooks , Doug McDermott , Kirk Hinrich , among others, the Bulls were one of the two favorite teams to come out of the Eastern Conference along with the Cleveland Cavaliers . The Bulls started off the season in style with a blowout win of the New York Knicks , and then winning 7 of their first 9 games (losses coming to the Cleveland Cavaliers and Boston Celtics ). The emergence of Jimmy Butler as a primary scorer for the Bulls was a major surprise and he surged into the forefront of the " Most Improved Player of the Year " award race. Butler's statistical jump was noted by many as one of the greatest in NBA History,  going from scoring just 13 points per game in 2013-14 to scoring 20 points per game in 2014-15. Pau Gasol was considered a huge asset for the Bulls and averaged a double-double throughout the season. Both Butler and Gasol ended up making the Eastern Conference All-Star team. The Bulls second half of the season was marred by inconsistency and frustration set in with Derrick Rose blasting the team for not being on the same page. Tension between management and Tom Thibodeau continued to be a dark cloud hanging over the organization. The Bulls finished with a 50-32 record and the 3rd seed in the Eastern Conference. They faced the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round, and took advantage of the young and inexperienced Bucks by going up a quick 3-0 in the series. However, inconsistency and not being on the same page yet again plagued the Bulls as the Bucks won the next two games, sending a scare to Chicago. The Bulls bounced back with fury in Game 6 however, beating the Bucks by a playoff record 54 points winning the series 4-2. The next round saw the Bulls facing their arch-rival Cleveland Cavaliers , and their biggest nemesis, LeBron James , who had beaten the Bulls in all three of their previous playoff meetings. The Bulls shocked the Cavs in Game 1 dominating them and never trailing. The Cavs answered back in Game 2 in the same fashion, never trailing the entire game. In a pivotal Game 3 in Chicago, the Bulls and Cavs battled closely all the way through, but the Bulls prevailed on a last-second buzzer beating 3-pointer by Derrick Rose . In Game 4 however, the Cavs once again, answered the Bulls, this time it was LeBron James who hit the buzzer-beating shot to win the game. The Bulls lack of consistency and poor offensive showing doomed them once again as the Cavs won the next 2 games handily and closed out the series 4-2. After the series, speculation erupted about Tom Thibodeau 's job security due to escalating feud between Thibodeau and Bulls front office managers Gar Forman and John Paxson . , On May 28, 2015, the Bulls fired Tom Thibodeau to seek a "change in approach."  The Bulls named Fred Hoiberg as their head coach on On June 2, 2015.  , With the return of LeBron James to the Cleveland Cavaliers , altercation has developed between the two teams. Notable actions include, Joakim Noah 's persistent scuffles with LeBron James and animosity between the two players and fan bases. , The Bulls' main division rivals have been the Detroit Pistons ever since the Jordan-led Bulls met the "Bad Boy" Pistons in the 1988 Eastern Conference semifinals. The two teams met in the playoffs four consecutive years, with the Pistons winning each time until 1991. The Eastern Conference Finals in 1991 ended with a four-game sweep of the Pistons, who walked off the floor with time still on the game clock.  The rivalry was renewed in the 2007 Eastern Conference Semifinals, in which former Detroit cornerstone Ben Wallace met his former team (the Pistons won in 6 games). The geographic proximity and membership in the Central Division further intensify the rivalry, which has been characterized by intense, physical play ever since the teams met in the late 1980s. Chicago fans have been known to have a disliking for Detroit professional teams, as it was in the same division as Chicago in all four major North American sports until recently when the Red Wings moved to the Eastern Conference for the 2013-14 season. , The Bulls and the Indiana Pacers ' rivalry begins with the two playing in the Central Division . This rivalry is best known from the match-ups in the 1990s in which Michael Jordan and Reggie Miller would go head-to-head. The Bulls and Pacers met in the 1998 Eastern Conference Finals. Chicago won the series in seven games. The rivalry was renewed when the two teams faced each other in the first round of the 2011 NBA Playoffs , with the Bulls winning the series in five games. , The Bulls and the Miami Heat rivalry began once the Heat became contenders during the 1990s, a decade dominated by the Bulls. They were eliminated 3 times by Chicago, who went on to win the title each time. The rivalry has come back due to the return of the Bulls to the playoffs in the post- Michael Jordan era and the emergence of Dwyane Wade and Derrick Rose . The revived rivalry has been very physical, involving rough plays and hard fouls between players, most notably the actions of former Heat player James Posey . The Bulls and Heat met in the 2011 Eastern Conference Finals, with the Heat winning in 5 games. On March 27, 2013, Chicago snapped Miami's 27-game winning streak. The Bulls and Heat met later that year in the 2013 Eastern Conference Semifinals. Miami won the series 4–1. Since LeBron James 's departure from Miami, the Bulls-Heat rivalry has experience a tough in comparison to the better part of the century. , Another franchise that the Bulls have competed fiercely with is the New York Knicks . The two met in the playoffs in four consecutive years (1991–94) and again in 1996, with the teams' series twice (1992 and 1994) going the full seven games. Their first playoff confrontation, however, came in 1989 when both teams were called "teams on the rise" under Michael Jordan and Patrick Ewing , respectively. That first confrontation would belong to Chicago within six games of the Eastern Semifinals. The Bulls triumphed in the first three years (1991–93) before narrowly losing in 1994 but exacted revenge in 1996. As with Detroit, the historic rivalry between the cities has led to animosity between the teams and occasionally their fans. , During the Bulls' run of dominance, the player introductions became world famous. Longtime announcer Tommy Edwards was the first to use "Sirius" , "On The Run" and other songs in game presentation in the NBA. When Edwards moved to Boston for employment with CBS Radio, he was replaced by Ray Clay in 1990, and Clay continued many of the traditional aspects of the Bulls introductions, including the music, The Alan Parsons Project 's "Sirius", for all six championship runs. The lights are first dimmed during the visiting team introduction, accompanied by " The Imperial March " from Star Wars composed by John Williams, or "On the Run" by Pink Floyd. Then virtually all lights in the stadium are shut off for the Bulls introduction, and a spotlight illuminates each player as he is introduced and runs onto the court; the spotlight is also focused on the Bulls logo prior to the introductions. Since the move to the United Center, lasers and fireworks have been added, and with improvements to the arena's White Way video screen, computer graphics on the stadium monitors have been added. These graphics feature the 3D-animated ' Running of the Bulls ' en route to the United Center, along the way smashing a bus featuring the opposing team's logo. Coincidentally, Alan Parsons wrote "Sirius" for his own band and was the sound engineer for "On the Run" from Pink Floyd's album The Dark Side of the Moon . , Traditionally, the players have been introduced in the following order: small forward, power forward, center, point guard, shooting guard. Thus during the championship era, Scottie Pippen was usually the first (or second) Bulls player introduced, and Michael Jordan the last. (Pippen and Jordan are the only players to play on all six Bulls championship teams.) More recently with Derrick Rose 's arrival, the guards have been reversed in order, making the Chicago-bred point guard the last player introduced. Although internal disputes eventually led to the dismissal of Clay, the Bulls in 2006 announced the return of Tommy Edwards as the announcer.  , As part of Edwards' return, the introductions changed as a new introduction was developed by Andy and Larry Wachowski , Ethan Stoller and Jamie Poindexter, all from Chicago. The introduction also included a newly composed remix of the traditional Sirius theme. , The Bulls have an unofficial tradition of wearing black shoes (regardless of being home or away) during the playoffs, which dates all the way back to 1989 when they debuted the tradition.  Then-Bulls backup center Brad Sellers suggested to wear black shoes as a way to show unity within the team. For the 1996 playoffs, they became the first team to wear black socks with the black shoes, similar to the University of Michigan and the Fab Five which started the trend in college earlier in the decade. Since, many teams have this look in both the regular season and playoffs. It was noted when the Bulls made their first playoff appearance during the 2004–05 season after a six-year hiatus, they continued the tradition and wore black shoes.  , Even though the Bulls generally wear black footwear in the playoffs since 1989, there have been some notable exceptions. In the 1995 playoffs against the Magic, when Michael Jordan debuted his Air Jordan XI shoe, he wore the white colorway during the Bulls' playoff games in Orlando. He was fined by the Bulls for not complying with their colorway policy. During the 2009 playoffs , the Bulls again broke the tradition when all of their players wore white shoes and socks in Game 3 of the first round against the Boston Celtics.  In the 2011 playoffs , several players such as Carlos Boozer and Joakim Noah sported red shoes in defiance of the tradition. , The Bulls and their arena mates, the Chicago Blackhawks , share an odd tradition dating back decades. Every fall, the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus comes to Chicago on its nationwide tour. Since this circus plays large venues instead of tents, it takes over the United Center for its entire run and the Bulls are forced, along with the Blackhawks, to take an extended road trip that usually lasts two weeks. The start of the "circus trip", as many sportscasters have dubbed it, is usually noted on shows such as SportsCenter .   , Dick Klein wanted a name that evoked Chicago's traditional meat packing industry and the Chicago Stadium's proximity to the Union Stock Yards . Klein considered names like Matadors or Toreadors , but dismissed them, saying, "If you think about it, no team with as many as three syllables in its nickname has ever had much success except for the [ Montreal Canadiens ]." After discussing possible names with his family, Klein settled on Bulls when his son Mark said, "Dad, that’s a bunch of bull!"  , The iconic Bulls' logo is a charging red bull's face. The logo was designed by noted American graphic designer Dean P. Wessel  and was adopted in 1966. At one point, the Bulls also had an alternate logo during the early 70s, featuring the same Bulls logo, but with a cloud that says "Windy City" below the bull's nose. , The Bulls have three different uniforms: a white home uniform, a red road uniform, and a black alternate road uniform. The design of the white and red sets are nearly identical, with the team name featured on the front over the number, and the player's last name over the number on the back and under the Bulls' logo. The shorts have the Bulls logo in a diamond shaped design on the sides of the legs. The red and white uniforms have remained mostly unchanged since 1966, with minor modifications from off-centered numbers, drop shadows and side stripes to white lettering and "Chicago" wordmark on the road uniforms. The present red/white uniform design was unveiled in the 1985–86 season, first using screen printing (with the player names in block lettering without the additional trim), before returning to the traditional sewing methods (player names are in serifed block lettering and with added trim). The Bulls logo was added atop the player's name in 2004. For the 2014–15 season, a gold tab representing the Bulls' six championships was added on the back hemline, while the NBA logo replaced the Bulls logo atop the player's name. , The less-often used black uniform (often used about 10 times per season) shares the same design as the white and the red ones, except that "Bulls" is replaced with "Chicago" on the front of the jersey. Black jerseys were first introduced during Chicago's 72-win run in the 1995–96 NBA season , and shared a similar design to the Bulls' regular road and home uniforms except that they featured pinstripes and a diamond that was not featured around the Bulls' logo in the shorts. This design was resurrected as part of the NBA Hardwood Classics Nights program, as well as NBA Heritage Week presentations (December 7–14, 2007) throughout the 2007–08 season . The black pinstriped uniform was used again for Hardwood Classics Night during the 2012–13 season as part of the NBA's tribute to the 1990s during the month of February. In the 1997–98 NBA season the pinstripes were removed. In 1999 "Chicago" replaced "Bulls" above the number in the jersey front, along with a change to v-necked jerseys and loss of arm piping a few years later. Beginning in the 2006-07 NBA season , the player's name on the back of the alternate jersey changed its color to white from the red/white combination, and the red diamond was added to surround the logo in the sides of the shorts. The player's name was reverted to the red/white combo in the 2007–08 NBA season . In the 2014–15 season, the diamonds on the shorts were tweaked, now featuring a black background and red striping, while a sleeved version of the black uniforms were used for select games. , The Bulls wear white shoes at home during the regular season, but black shoes on the road and black shoes all throughout the playoffs, both at home and on the road. The unofficial playoff tradition goes back to the Jordan era, recommended by Brad Sellers as a show of team unity. The Bulls also wear only their red uniform on the road during the playoffs. During the 2008–09 season and first three games of the playoffs , however, the Bulls wore black sneakers on away games only while wearing white sneakers on home games. Since the 2009–10 season, however, the NBA has relaxed its rules on specific sneaker colors on home and away games, and several Bulls players are seen wearing white sneakers on the road, or black at home during the regular season, even seen wearing red on occasion. , In 2006 the Bulls were one of three teams to take part in the NBA's first ever St. Patrick's Day uniform program (with the Boston Celtics and formerly the New York Knicks ). The program consisted of the teams wearing specially designed green uniforms. For the program the Bulls' changed their red road uniforms to green while maintaining the traditional red and black bull's head on the shorts and the back of the jersey as well as the wording of "Bulls" on the front remaining black. Since 2014, a sleeved version of the St. Patrick's uniforms is now used, with tweaks such as white lettering with gold and black trim, and the city name in front. , The Bulls also participated in the NBA's "Noche Latina" celebrations throughout March, beginning in 2009. They used a slightly altered version of their regular red road uniforms, with the wording "Los Bulls" to honor Hispanics throughout Chicago. The uniforms were used every season except for 2014, when they used a sleeved black version with "Los Bulls" in white with red and black trim. , During the NBA's "Green Week" celebrations, the Bulls also wore green uniforms, but with a slightly darker shade from their St. Patrick's Day counterparts. They used their black alternate uniforms as its template. They donned the uniforms in a game against the Philadelphia 76ers on April 9, 2009. , Benny the Bull is the main mascot of the Chicago Bulls. He was first introduced in 1969. Benny is a red bull who wears number 1. Benny is one of the oldest and most well known mascots in all of professional sports. The Bulls also had another mascot named Da Bull. Introduced in 1995, he was described on the team website as being the high flying cousin of Benny, known for his dunking skills. The man who portrayed Da Bull was arrested in 2004 for possession and selling marijuana from his car.  Da Bull was discontinued soon after the incident. While Benny has a family-friendly design, Da Bull was designed as a more realistic bull. Unlike Benny, Da Bull was brown. He also had a meaner facial expression and wore number 95. , NBA Most Valuable Player , NBA Defensive Player of the Year , NBA All-Star Weekend Three-Point Shootout , NBA All-Star Weekend Slam Dunk Contest , NBA Rookie of the Year , NBA Sixth Man of the Year , NBA Most Improved Player Award , NBA Finals MVP , NBA All-Star Game MVP , NBA All-Star Weekend Skills Challenge , Best NBA Player ESPY Award , NBA Sportsmanship Award , NBA Coach of the Year , NBA Executive of the Year , NBA scoring champion , All-NBA First Team , All-NBA Second Team , All-NBA Third Team , NBA All-Defensive First Team , NBA All-Defensive Second Team , NBA All-Rookie First Team , NBA All-Rookie Second Team , NBA All-Star selections , NBA All-Star head coach , In 1992, the team began training at the Berto Center, located at 550 Lake Cook Rd, Deerfield , Illinois. , However, on June 13, 2012, the team announced that it would move its practice facility to a downtown location closer to the United Center to reduce game day commutes.  , On September 12, 2014, the Bulls officially opened their new training facility, the Advocate Center.  , Tom Amberry has worked with the Bulls to help the players with their free-throw shooting.  , The Bulls hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who isn't signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.  This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. , The flagship station for the Bulls is WMVP , "ESPN 1000". WMVP became the flagship for the 07–08 season after WCKG changed formats.   Chuck Swirsky and Bill Wennington are the announcers. , The Bulls' television broadcasts are split among Comcast SportsNet Chicago , which broadcasts most of the games, WGN , and WCIU .  So far, WGN Sports and Comcast SportsNet Chicago will at least air all of the home games in High Definition . The announcers are Neil Funk and Stacey King . Also worth noting is that WGN does not air all of its Chicago Bulls games nationwide: only a select few, usually Saturday games, are nationally televised on WGN America . The rest are only available within the Chicago area.  The Detroit Pistons are an American professional basketball team based in Auburn Hills, Michigan , a suburb of Metro Detroit . The Pistons are members of the Central Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA); the team's home arena is The Palace of Auburn Hills . In 1941, the team was founded in Fort Wayne, Indiana as the Fort Wayne (Zollner) Pistons , a member of the National Basketball League (NBL). The Pistons joined the Basketball Association of America (BAA) in 1948. In 1949, the NBL and BAA merged to become the NBA, and the Pistons became part of the merged league.   Since moving to Detroit in 1957, the Pistons have won three (3) NBA championships: in 1989 , 1990 and 2004 . , , , The Detroit Pistons' franchise was founded as the Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons, a National Basketball League (NBL) team, playing in the gym of North Side High School in Fort Wayne, Indiana . Owners Fred Zollner and his sister Janet's Zollner Corporation was a foundry , manufacturing pistons , primarily for car, truck and locomotive engines. Fred Zollner, who currently owns a professional softball team known as the Zollner Piston softball team, was eventually persuaded to start a basketball team due to the fact that Indiana was so basketball minded. The Zollner Pistons were NBL champions in 1944 and 1945. They also won the World Professional Basketball Tournament in 1944, 1945 and 1946. , In 1948, the team became the Fort Wayne Pistons, competing in the Basketball Association of America (BAA). In 1949, Fred Zollner brokered the formation of the National Basketball Association from the BAA and the NBL at his kitchen table. , There are suggestions that Pistons players conspired with gamblers to shave points and throw various games during the 1953–54 and 1954–55 seasons. In particular, there are accusations that the team may have intentionally lost the 1955 NBA Finals to the Syracuse Nationals .  In the decisive Game 7, the Pistons led Syracuse 41–24 early in the second quarter, then the Nationals rallied to win the game.  Syracuse won on a free throw by George King with twelve seconds left in the game. The closing moments included a palming turnover by the Pistons' George Yardley with 18 seconds left, a foul by Frankie Brian with 12 seconds left that enabled King's winning free throw, and a turnover by the Pistons' Andy Phillip with three seconds left which cost Fort Wayne a chance to attempt the game-winning shot.  , Though the Pistons enjoyed a solid local following, Fort Wayne's small size made it difficult for them to be profitable, especially as other early NBA teams based in smaller cities started folding or relocating to larger markets. After the 1956-57 season, Zollner decided that Fort Wayne was too small to support an NBA team and announced the team would be playing elsewhere in the coming season. He ultimately settled on Detroit. Although it was the fifth largest city in the United States at the time, Detroit had not seen professional basketball in a decade. In 1947, they had lost the Detroit Gems of the NBL, which disbanded and the remnants became the Minneapolis Lakers (now the Los Angeles Lakers ), and the Detroit Falcons of the BAA, which folded. , Zollner decided to keep the Pistons name, believing it made sense given Detroit's status as the center of the automobile industry. , The new Detroit Pistons played in Olympia Stadium (home of the NHL 's Detroit Red Wings at the time) for their first four seasons, then moved to Cobo Arena . The franchise was a consistent disappointment, struggling both on the court and at the box office. , During the 1960s and 1970s, the Pistons were characterized by very strong individuals and weak teams. In fact, in their first 27 years in Detroit, they only had three winning seasons. Some of the superstars who played for the team included Dave DeBusschere , Dave Bing , Jimmy Walker , and Bob Lanier . At one point DeBusschere was the youngest player-coach in the history of the NBA. Unfortunately, an ill-timed trade during the 1968 season sent the popular home grown DeBusschere to the New York Knicks for Howard Komives and Walt Bellamy , both of whom were in the later stages of their careers. DeBusschere became the key player that then led the Knicks to two NBA titles. The Dave Bing and Bob Lanier era did have some solid and exciting years but they were handicapped by being in the same division as the Milwaukee Bucks , which had a young Lew Alcindor and the Chicago Bulls , which likewise had some very strong players. , In 1974, Zollner sold the team to glass magnate Bill Davidson , who remained the team's principal owner until his death on March 14, 2009. Davidson was displeased with Cobo Arena, but opted not to follow the NHL's Detroit Red Wings to the under-construction Joe Louis Arena . Instead, Davidson moved them to the suburb of Pontiac in 1978, where they played in the mammoth Silverdome , a structure built for professional football (and the home of the Detroit Lions at the time). , The Pistons stumbled their way out of the 1970s and into the 1980s, beginning with a 16–66 record in 1979–80 and following up with a 21–61 record in 1980–81. The 1979–80 team lost its last 14 games of the season which, when coupled with the seven losses at the start of the 1980–81 season, comprised a then-NBA record losing streak of 21 games (since broken). , The franchise's fortunes finally began to turn in 1981, when it drafted point guard Isiah Thomas from Indiana University . In early 1982, the Pistons acquired center Bill Laimbeer in a trade from the Cleveland Cavaliers and guard Vinnie Johnson from the Seattle SuperSonics . The three would remain together for a decade, forming much of the core of a team that would rise to the top of the league. , Initially the Pistons had a tough time moving up the NBA ladder. In 1984 , the Pistons lost a tough five-game series to the underdog New York Knicks , three games to two. In the 1985 playoffs , Detroit won its first-round series and faced the defending champion Boston Celtics in the conference semifinals. Though Boston would prevail in six games, Detroit's surprise performance promised that a rivalry had begun. In the 1985 NBA Draft , the team selected Joe Dumars 18th overall, a selection that would prove very wise. They also acquired Rick Mahorn in a trade with the Washington Bullets . However, the team initially took a step backward, losing in the first round of the 1986 playoffs to the more athletic Atlanta Hawks . After the series, Coach Chuck Daly and team captain Thomas decided that their best chance to seize control of the Eastern Conference would be through a more aggressive style of play. , Prior to the 1986–87 season , the Pistons acquired more key players: John Salley (drafted 11th overall), Dennis Rodman (drafted 27th) and Adrian Dantley (acquired in a trade with the Utah Jazz). The team adopted a physical, defense-oriented style of play, which eventually earned them the nickname "Bad Boys." In 1987, the team reached the Eastern Conference Finals—the first time it had advanced that far since 1961—against the Celtics . After pushing the defending champions to a 2–2 tie, the Pistons were on the verge of winning Game 5 at the Boston Garden with seconds remaining. After a Celtics' turnover, Thomas attempted to quickly inbound the ball and missed Daly's timeout signal from the bench (the NBA had not yet instituted the rule that allowed coaches to call timeout themselves). Larry Bird stole the inbound pass and passed it to Dennis Johnson for the game-winning layup. While the Pistons would win Game 6 in Detroit, they would lose the series in a tough Game 7 back in Boston. , Motivated by their loss to the Celtics, the 1988 Pistons , aided by midseason acquisition James Edwards , improved to a then-franchise-record 54 victories and the franchise's first division title in 33 years. In the postseason , the Pistons avenged their two previous playoff losses to the Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals, defeating them in six games and advancing to the NBA Finals for the first time since the franchise moved to Detroit. , The Pistons' first trip to the Finals in 33 years saw them face the Los Angeles Lakers , who were led by Magic Johnson , James Worthy , and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar . After taking a 3–2 series lead back to Los Angeles , Detroit appeared poised to win their first NBA title in Game 6. In that game, Isiah Thomas scored an NBA Finals record 25 points in the third quarter while playing on a severely sprained ankle. However, the Lakers won the game, 103–102, on a pair of last-minute free throws by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar following a controversial foul called on Bill Laimbeer , referred to by many Piston supporters, and Laimbeer himself, as a "phantom foul." With Isiah Thomas unable to compete at full strength, the Pistons narrowly fell in Game 7, 108–105. , Prior to the 1988–89 season , the Pistons moved to Auburn Hills to play at The Palace of Auburn Hills . The 1989 Pistons completed the building of their roster by trading Dantley for Mark Aguirre , a trade that Piston fans would criticize heavily initially, but later praise. The team won 63 games, shattering their one-year-old franchise record, and steamrolled through the playoffs and into a NBA Finals rematch with the Lakers . This time the Pistons came out victorious in a four-game sweep to win their first NBA championship. Joe Dumars was named NBA Finals MVP . , The Pistons successfully defended their title in 1990, despite losing Mahorn to the Timberwolves in the expansion draft. After winning 59 games and a third straight division title, the Pistons cruised through the first two rounds of the playoffs before playing a tough Eastern Conference Finals series against Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls . Facing each other for the third straight season, the Pistons and Bulls split the first six games before the Pistons finished the series with a decisive 93–74 victory in Game 7.  Advancing to their third consecutive NBA Finals , the Pistons faced the Portland Trail Blazers . After splitting the first two games at The Palace, the Pistons went to Portland , where they had not won a game since 1974, to play Games 3, 4 and 5. The Pistons summarily won all three games in Portland, becoming the first NBA team to sweep the middle three games on the road. The decisive game came down to the final second. Trailing 90–83 with two minutes remaining, the Pistons rallied to tie the game, then took a 92–90 lead when Vinnie Johnson sank an 18-foot jumper with 00.7 seconds left in the game; this shot earned Johnson a new nickname in Detroit, "007", to go with his original, "The Microwave ". Isiah Thomas was named NBA Finals MVP. , The Pistons' championship run came to an end in the 1991 Eastern Conference Finals, as the Pistons were swept by the eventual NBA champion Chicago Bulls, 4 games to 0. The most critical Piston injury belonged to Isiah Thomas who had surgery on his wrist just prior to the NBA Playoffs . The Conference Finals were best remembered for the Pistons walking off court in the last game just before it ended, unwilling to shake hands with the Bulls. After the series, Jordan said he was "shocked that Isiah didn't play as hard." Following this, the franchise went through a lengthy transitional period, as key players either retired (Laimbeer in 1993 and Thomas in 1994) or were traded (Edwards, Johnson, Salley and Rodman among others). The team quickly declined, bottoming out in the 1993–94 season when they finished 20–62. , The team's fortunes improved after that season, but the rebuilding process soon sputtered. As a result of the poor finish in the 1994 season , the Pistons were able to draft Grant Hill , a promising small forward . However, this period also saw the team make numerous questionable personnel decisions, such as the loss of free agent Allan Houston to the New York Knicks ,  the signing of free agent wash-outs Christian Laettner , Loy Vaught , Cedric Ceballos , and Bison Dele ; and head coaching changes from Ron Rothstein to Don Chaney to Doug Collins to Alvin Gentry to George Irvine in an eight-year span. Of those coaches, only Collins had any sort of success with the Pistons, winning 54 games in the 1996–97 season . The franchise even changed its team colors in 1996 from its traditional red, white, and blue to teal , burgundy , gold and black in what proved to be a highly unpopular move with fans. This period has become known, often derisively, as the "teal era". , After being swept by the Miami Heat in the 2000 playoffs , Joe Dumars (who had retired following the 1999 season) was hired as the team's president of basketball operations. He quickly faced what appeared to be a setback for the franchise, as Grant Hill elected to leave the team for the Orlando Magic . However, Dumars managed to work a sign and trade with Orlando that brought the Pistons Ben Wallace and Chucky Atkins in exchange for Hill. Both quickly entered the Pistons' starting lineup, and Wallace would develop into an All-Star in the coming years. Conversely, Hill would play only 47 games in the following four seasons due to a recurring ankle injury. , The Pistons suffered through another tough season in 2000–01 , going 32–50. After the season, Dumars fired Irvine and hired Rick Carlisle , a widely respected assistant coach who had been a tough substitute contributor for the Celtics during the mid-1980s. In 2001, the franchise also adopted a modified version of its traditional red-white-and-blue scheme. , Carlisle helped lead the Pistons to their first 50-win season since 1997 , and their first playoff series victory since 1991. In the 2002 offseason, Dumars revamped the Pistons' roster by signing free agent Chauncey Billups , acquiring Richard "Rip" Hamilton from the Washington Wizards , and by drafting Tayshaun Prince from Kentucky . The Pistons posted consecutive 50-win seasons and advanced to the 2003 Eastern Conference Finals , for the first time since 1991. There, however, they were swept in four games by the New Jersey Nets . , Despite the team's improvement, Carlisle was fired in the 2003 off-season. There were believed to be five reasons for the firing: first, that Carlisle had appeared reluctant to play some of the team's younger players, such as Prince and Mehmet Okur , during the regular season, which had upset Dumars; second, that some of the players (notably Wallace) had not gotten along with Carlisle; third, that Carlisle's offense was thought to be conservative; fourth, that Hall of Famer Larry Brown had become available; and finally fifth, that Carlisle was rumored to be interested in the Pacers head coaching job during the Pistons' 2003 playoff run. Brown accepted the job that summer and Carlisle landed the job in Indiana as expected. , The Pistons' transformation into a championship team was completed with the February 2004 acquisition of Rasheed Wallace . The Pistons now had another big man to pose a threat from all parts of the court. The Pistons finished the season 54–28, recording their best record since 1997. In the 2004 playoffs , after defeating the Milwaukee Bucks in five games, they defeated the defending Eastern Conference champion New Jersey Nets in seven games after coming back from a 3–2 deficit. Detroit then defeated the Pacers, coached by Carlisle, in six tough games to advance to the NBA Finals for the first time since 1990. Many analysts gave the Pistons little chance to win against their opponents, the Los Angeles Lakers , who had won three out of the previous four NBA championships, and who fielded a star-studded lineup that included Shaquille O'Neal , Kobe Bryant , Gary Payton and Karl Malone . However, the Pistons won the series in dominating fashion, defeating Los Angeles in five games for the team's third NBA Championship . The Pistons posted double-digit wins in three of their four victories, and held the Lakers to a franchise-low 68 points in Game 3. Chauncey Billups was named NBA Finals MVP. With the win, Bill Davidson became the first (and to this date, the only) owner to win both NBA and NHL championships in the same year, having won the Stanley Cup as owner of the Tampa Bay Lightning . , Despite losing key members of their bench during the off-season (including Okur, Mike James and Corliss Williamson ), the Pistons were considered a strong contender to win a second consecutive title in 2005. They won 54 games during the regular season , their fourth consecutive season of 50 or more wins. During the 2005 playoffs , they easily defeated the Philadelphia 76ers 4–1 and then rallied from a 2–1 deficit to finish off the Indiana Pacers , 4–2. In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Pistons faced the Miami Heat . Once again, Detroit fell behind, but won the Eastern Conference Championship in seven games. In the NBA Finals , the Pistons faced the San Antonio Spurs . In the first NBA Finals Game 7 since 1994, the Pistons lost a hard-fought game with the Spurs, who won their third NBA championship since 1999. , The Pistons' 2004–05 season was marked by a major controversy, as well as distracting issues involving Larry Brown. In the first month of the season, a Pacers–Pistons brawl erupted, one of the largest fan-player incidents in the history of American sports. It resulted in heavy fines and suspensions for several players, and a great deal of NBA and media scrutiny. Meanwhile, Brown was forced to leave the team on two occasions due to health concerns, and also became involved in a series of rumors linking him to other job openings. Concerned about Brown's health, and angered over his alleged pursuit of other jobs during the season, the Pistons bought out his contract soon after the 2005 NBA Finals . Brown was promptly named head coach of the New York Knicks , and the Pistons hired Flip Saunders , formerly of the Minnesota Timberwolves . , During the 2005–06 season , the Pistons recorded the NBA's best overall record. Their 37–5 start exceeded the best start for any Detroit sports franchise in history  and tied for the second-best 42-game start in NBA history. Four of the five Piston starters, Chauncey Billups , Richard Hamilton , Rasheed Wallace , and Ben Wallace , were named to the All-Star team, and Flip Saunders served as the Eastern Conference All-Star team coach. The Pistons finished the regular season with a record of 64–18, setting new franchise records for both overall and road victories (27). In addition, the team set an NBA record by starting the same lineup in 73 consecutive games from the start of the season. , The top-seeded Pistons defeated the Milwaukee Bucks 4–1 in the first round of the 2006 NBA Playoffs , but struggled in the second round against the Cleveland Cavaliers , falling behind 3–2 before winning in seven games. Things did not improve against second-seeded Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals . Miami defeated the Pistons in six games en route to the 2006 NBA championship . , During the 2006 off-season, the Pistons offered Ben Wallace a four-year, $48 million contract which would have made him the highest-paid Piston ever. However, Wallace agreed to a 4-year, $60 million contract with the Chicago Bulls .  , To replace Ben Wallace, the Pistons signed Nazr Mohammed as a center. He struggled to fill the team's void at center, however, and the team began looking for additional help. On January 17, the Pistons signed Chris Webber , who had become a free agent. The Pistons quickly began playing better basketball and, according to Newsday , started "to get their swagger back."  The Pistons were only 21–15 before Webber was acquired; with him, the team went 32–14. On April 11, the Pistons clinched the best record in the Eastern Conference, which guaranteed them home-court advantage for first three rounds of the playoffs. , The Pistons opened the 2007 NBA Playoffs with a 4–0 victory over the Orlando Magic , their first playoff series sweep since 1990. The team advanced to face the Chicago Bulls , marking the first time that the Central Division rivals had met in the postseason since 1991. After winning the first two games by 26 and 21 points, the Pistons overcame a 19-point deficit to win Game 3, 81–74. Chicago avoided elimination by winning Games 4 and 5, but the Pistons closed out the series, 95–85, in Game 6. They advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals for the fifth consecutive time (equaling their streak from 1987–1991)— three short of the NBA record set by the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1980s. In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Pistons won games 1 and 2, but lost 4 in a row to the Cleveland Cavaliers . , In the 2007 NBA Draft the Pistons selected Rodney Stuckey as the 15th overall pick and Arron Afflalo as the 27th overall pick.  They also re-signed Chauncey Billups to a long-term contract, as well as re-signing top prospect Amir Johnson and key reserve Antonio McDyess . This season marked the 50th anniversary of the franchise in Detroit. , At the start of the 2008 season , Rasheed Wallace became the Pistons' new center. Upon entering his third season as Pistons coach, Saunders became the longest-tenured Pistons coach since Chuck Daly 's nine-year tenure (1983–92). Detroit finished the season 59–23, with the second-best record in the league. The Boston Celtics held the first seed, and many speculated that Boston was their main competition in the Eastern Conference. In the 2008 NBA Playoffs , Detroit started out poorly with a Game 1 loss to the seventh-seeded Philadelphia 76ers and found themselves in a 2-games-to-1 deficit. But the Pistons rallied to defeat the Sixers in six games. , Meanwhile in the 2008 NBA Playoffs , Detroit rolled out to a Game 1 romp of the Orlando Magic , and won a tight Game 2 amid mild controversy. At the very end of the third quarter, Chauncey Billups hit a three-point field goal that gave the Pistons a three-point lead. However, the clock had stopped shortly into the play. League rules currently prohibit officials from using both instant replay and a timing device to measure how much time has elapsed when a clock malfunctions, nor is a replay from the time of the malfunction onward allowed. The officials estimated that the play took 4.6 seconds, and since there were 5.1 seconds remaining when it began, the field goal was counted. The NBA later admitted that the play actually took 5.7 seconds and the basket should not have counted.  , In addition to losing Game 3 badly, 111–86, the Pistons also lost all-star point guard and team leader Chauncey Billups to a hamstring injury. Despite his absence, the Pistons rallied from 15 down in the third quarter to win Game 4 90–89, on a field goal by Tayshaun Prince with just 8.9 seconds to play, taking a 3–1 series lead. Again with Billups sitting on the sideline, they then proceeded to win Game 5 in Detroit, winning the series 4 games to 1. , Detroit advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals for the sixth straight season, squaring off against the Boston Celtics . This put the Pistons second on the all-time list of most consecutive conference final appearances, only behind the Los Angeles Lakers who appeared in 8 straight conference finals from the 1981–82 to 1988–89 seasons.  They lost Game 1 88–79, but won in game two on the road, 103–97 (marking Boston's first home court loss in the 2008 postseason). Immediately following that, the Celtics won their first road playoff game of the post-season, 94–80, in game three. Game four saw the Pistons win 94–75. In the pivotal fifth game, they lost 106–102, despite rallying from 18 points down late in the game. In Game 6, the Pistons entered the fourth quarter leading 70–60, but a lack of focus, a poor game from Rasheed Wallace , and a rally-killing turnover by Tayshaun Prince ultimately led to their demise; the Pistons ended their season with an 89–81 loss. The postgame interview was notable for Wallace, possibly knowing Dumars would soon break up the core of the team, saying simply, "It's over, man." After that, the Celtics went on to win the 2008 NBA Finals . On June 3, 2008, the Pistons announced that head coach Flip Saunders would not return as head coach for the 2008–09 regular season.  , In November 2008, the Pistons traded its key members Chauncey Billups and Antonio McDyess for Allen Iverson .  McDyess was later waived on November 10 and rejoined the Pistons on December 9, 2008. This Billups/Iverson trade was marked as a start of a new rebuilding process because of Iverson's free agent status at the end of the season. , The season was marked with many controversies and injuries. As a result of that, and poor play, the Pistons dropped down the standings, only clinching a playoff berth on April 10, 2009, good for the #8 seed at 39–43, their first losing season in 7 years. The Pistons were swept by the Cleveland Cavaliers in four games in the first round of the 2009 NBA Playoffs . It was the first time the Pistons had been eliminated in the first round of the playoffs since 2000. Iverson left the team at the end of the season. , In the 2009/2010 offseason, Dumars reached an agreement with the former Bulls guard Ben Gordon on a 5 year/$55 million contract, as well as an agreement with former Bucks forward Charlie Villanueva on a 5-year contract worth $35 million. That same month, the Pistons lost their two key members during the last few years, veterans Rasheed Wallace and Antonio McDyess . On July 8, 2009, Dumars hired former Cavaliers assistant coach John Kuester to be the Pistons new head coach.  Kuester was, same as his predecessor Michael Curry , a debutant on the NBA head coach position. , The Pistons signed back their former player and former defensive player of the year, center Ben Wallace , before the 2009–2010 season.  , Despite these changes, the team regressed even further, hampered by injuries to key players. On March 23, 2010, the Pistons were eliminated from playoff contention with a loss to the Indiana Pacers, assuring their first Draft Lottery appearance and their first 50-loss season since 2001. The Pistons finished with a 27–55 record, and were last in the Central Division. It was their worst record since 1994. Another 50-loss season, this time finishing at 30–52, led to the firing of Kuester at the end of the 2010–11 season. , On April 7, 2011, the Detroit Pistons reached a long awaited agreement to sell the NBA franchise to billionaire Tom Gores . The deal was granted by NBA in June and also included The Palace of Auburn Hills and DTE Energy Music Theatre .  According to Crain's Detroit Business , the final sale price was $325 million, far lower than expected.  , Prior to the 2011–12 season , the team decided to hire a new coach, Lawrence Frank , former head coach of the New Jersey Nets and an assistant coach of the Boston Celtics , and parted ways with yet another member of the 2004 championship team, veteran guard Richard Hamilton . The 2011–12 season was an improvement from previous years for the Pistons, although they still posted a losing record. While they started the season 4–20, they managed to win half their remaining games to finish a lockout -shortened season with a record of 25–41. , The team continued to build upon its young core and following the drafting of the talented center Andre Drummond , the new direction of rebuilding with young draft picks was never more obvious, with five rookies on the roster for the 2012–13 season . , In January 2013, the Pistons executed a 3-team trade with Memphis Grizzlies and Toronto Raptors . With that move, the last remaining member of the famous 2004 championship team, Tayshaun Prince , was sent to Memphis , ending his 10-year stint with his native team. The Pistons acquired guard Jose Calderon and his expiring contract. Following the 2012–13 season , coach Lawrence Frank was fired on April 18, 2013, after two losing seasons,  and on June 10, 2013, the Pistons hired former player and coach, Maurice Cheeks . On July 8, 2013, Rasheed Wallace signed a two-year contract to join the Detroit Pistons' coaching staff as an assistant coach, however, after the first year Wallace was fired by new coach and President of Basketball Operations, Stan Van Gundy.   , During the summer of 2013, the club has signed three prominent free agents, forward and potential all-star Josh Smith , a former player and 2004 NBA Finals MVP , veteran Chauncey Billups ,  and the Italian league MVP Luigi Datome from Virtus Roma and agreed to sign and trade Brandon Knight , Viacheslav Kravtsov and Khris Middleton to the Milwaukee Bucks , for point guard Brandon Jennings .  , Halfway through the 2013–14 season , Pistons relieved Maurice Cheeks of his head coaching duties and replaced him with John Loyer on an interim basis for the remainder of the season.  In April the Detroit Pistons announced that Joe Dumars would step down as President of Basketball Operations, yet remain as an advisor to the organization and its ownership team,  and on May 14, 2014, Stan Van Gundy was hired. The former Miami Heat and the Orlando Magic coach, signed a 5-year, $35 million contract to become the head coach and President of Basketball Operations for the team.  , After starting the 2014–15 season with a 5–23 record, the Pistons waived Josh Smith .  They would finish the season 32-50, enough for a 12th place finish in the Eastern Conference and were awarded the 8th pick in the 2015 NBA Draft . , The Pistons flagship radio station is WMGC-FM Detroit Sports 105.1 FM. They took over from WXYT-FM starting with the 2014-15 season. There are several affiliate stations throughout Michigan.  The regular radio announcers are Mark Champion with play-by-play and Rick Mahorn with color commentary. , The Pistons' current exclusive local television rights holder is Fox Sports Detroit .  The regular TV announcers are George Blaha with play-by-play, Greg Kelser with color commentary, Mateen Cleaves with studio analysis and Matt Shepard with sideline reports . , When based in Fort Wayne, Indiana: , In the Detroit area: , Notes: , All of the Pistons retired numbers are currently hanging in the rafters of The Palace of Auburn Hills. The numbers were also placed on the Pistons floor on the sidelines, but were removed prior to the 2011–12 season . , Greg Monroe has worn the number 10 since joining the Pistons in 2010; although the team retired the number for Dennis Rodman in 2011, Monroe has been permitted to continue to wear the number with Rodman's blessing.  , Lloyd was inducted as a contributor as the first African-American player and bench coach in the NBA. , Vitale was inducted as a contributor for his career as a college basketball broadcaster. , Bing, Daly, Davidson, DeBusschere, Dumars, Lanier, Thomas, Yardley and Zollner have also been inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame . , NBA Finals MVP , NBA Defensive Player of the Year , NBA Rookie of the Year , NBA Sixth Man of the Year , NBA Coach of the Year , NBA Executive of the Year , All-NBA First Team , All-NBA Second Team , All-NBA Third Team , NBA All-Defensive First Team , NBA All-Defensive Second Team , NBA All-Rookie First Team , NBA All-Rookie Second Team  The Indiana Pacers are a professional basketball team based in Indianapolis , Indiana . They are members of the Central Division in the Eastern Conference of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Pacers were first established in 1967 as members of the American Basketball Association (ABA) and became members of the NBA in 1976 as a result of the ABA-NBA merger . They play their home games at Bankers Life Fieldhouse . The team is named after Indiana 's history with the Indianapolis 500's pace cars .  , The Pacers have won three championships, all in the ABA. The Pacers were Eastern Conference champions in 2000 . The team has won eight division titles. Five Hall of Fame players - Reggie Miller , Chris Mullin , Alex English , Mel Daniels , and Roger Brown - played with the Pacers for multiple seasons.  , , , In early 1967, a group of six investors (among them attorney Richard Tinkham , John DeVoe, Chuck DeVoe, sports agent Chuck Barnes and Indianapolis Star sports writer Bob Collins) pooled their resources to purchase a franchise in the proposed American Basketball Association . , For their first seven years, they played in the Indiana State Fairgrounds Coliseum . In 1974, they moved to the plush new Market Square Arena in downtown Indianapolis , where they played for 25 years. , Early in the Pacers' second season, former Indiana Hoosiers standout Bob "Slick" Leonard became the team's head coach, replacing Larry Staverman. Leonard quickly turned the Pacers into a juggernaut. His teams were buoyed by the great play of superstars such as Mel Daniels , George McGinnis , Bob Netolicky , Rick Mount and Roger Brown . The Pacers were – and ended – as the most successful team in ABA history, winning three ABA Championships in four years. In all, they appeared in the ABA Finals five times in the league's nine-year history: a feat that was never bettered by any other ABA franchise.  , The Pacers were one of four ABA teams that joined the NBA in the ABA-NBA merger in 1976. For the 1976–77 season the Pacers were joined in the merged league by the Denver Nuggets , New York Nets , and San Antonio Spurs . , The league charged a $3.2 million entry fee for each former ABA team.  Since the NBA would only agree to accept four ABA teams in the ABA-NBA merger, the Pacers and the three other surviving ABA teams also had to compensate the two remaining ABA franchises which were not a part of the merger, the Spirits of St. Louis and Kentucky Colonels . As a result of the merger, the four teams dealt with financial troubles. Additionally, the Pacers had some financial troubles which dated back to their waning days in the ABA; they had begun selling off some of their star players in the last ABA season. The new NBA teams also were barred from sharing in national TV revenues for four years.  , The Pacers finished their inaugural NBA season with a record of 36–46. Billy Knight and Don Buse represented Indiana in the NBA All-Star Game . However, this was one of the few bright spots of the Pacers' first 13 years in the NBA. During this time, they had only three non-losing seasons and only two playoff appearances. , A lack of continuity became the norm for most of the next decade, as they traded away Knight and Buse before the 1977–78 season even started. They acquired Adrian Dantley in exchange for Knight, but Dantley (who was averaging nearly 27 points per game at the time) was traded in December, while the Pacers' second-leading scorer, John Williamson , was dealt in January. , The early Pacers came out on the short end of two of the most one-sided trades in NBA history. In 1980, they traded Alex English to the Nuggets in order to reacquire former ABA star George McGinnis . McGinnis was long past his prime, and contributed very little during his two-year return. English, in contrast, went on to become one of the greatest scorers in NBA history. The next year, they traded a 1984 draft pick to the Portland Trail Blazers for center Tom Owens , who played one year for the Pacers with little impact. In 1983–84 , the Pacers finished with the worst record in the Eastern Conference, which would have given the Pacers the second overall pick in the draft—the pick that the Blazers used to select Sam Bowie while Michael Jordan was still available. As a result of the Owens trade, they were left as bystanders in the midst of one of the deepest drafts in NBA history—including such future stars as Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon , Charles Barkley , and John Stockton . , Clark Kellogg was drafted by the Pacers in the 1982 and finished second in the Rookie of the Year voting, but the Pacers finished the 1982–83 season with their all-time worst record of 20–62, and won only 26 games the following season . After winning 22 games in 1984–85 and 26 games in 1985–86 , Jack Ramsay replaced George Irvine as coach and led the Pacers to a 41–41 record in 1986–87 and their second playoff appearance as an NBA team. Chuck Person , nicknamed "The Rifleman" for his renowned long-range shooting, led the team in scoring as a rookie and won NBA Rookie of the Year honors. Their first playoff win in NBA franchise history was earned in Game 3 of their first-round, best-of-five series against the Atlanta Hawks , but it was their only victory in that series, as the Hawks defeated them in four games. , Reggie Miller was drafted by the Pacers in 1987 , beginning his career as a backup to John Long . Many fans at the time disagreed with Miller's selection over Indiana Hoosiers' standout Steve Alford .  The Pacers missed the playoffs in 1987–88 , drafted Rik Smits in the 1988 NBA Draft , and suffered through a disastrous 1988–89 season in which coach Jack Ramsay stepped down following an 0–7 start. Mel Daniels and George Irvine filled in on an interim basis before Dick Versace took over the 6–23 team on the way to a 28–54 finish. In February 1989, the team traded veteran center Herb Williams to the Dallas Mavericks for future NBA Sixth Man-of-the Year Detlef Schrempf . , From 1989 - 1993, the Pacers would play at or near .500 and qualify for the playoffs. Despite four straight first round exits, this period was highlighted by a first round series with the Boston Celtics in 1991 that went to Game 5. The Pacers lost 3-2 and were swept the following season by the Celtics. In 1993, they lost 3-1 to their new rival the New York Knicks . , Larry Brown was brought aboard as Pacers' coach for the 1993–94 season, and Pacers' general manager Donnie Walsh completed a then highly criticized trade as he sent Schrempf to the Seattle SuperSonics in exchange for Derrick McKey and little known Gerald Paddio . But the Pacers won their last eight games of the season to finish with an NBA-era franchise-high 47 wins. They stormed past Shaquille O'Neal and the Orlando Magic in a first-round sweep to earn their first NBA playoff series win , and pulled off an upset by defeating the top-seeded Atlanta Hawks in the Conference semifinals. , With the 1994 Eastern Conference Finals tied going into Game 5 in New York, and the Pacers trailing the Knicks by 15 points early in the fourth quarter, Reggie Miller scored 25 points in that quarter, including five 3-point field goals. Miller also flashed the choke sign to the Knicks' number one fan, Spike Lee , while leading the Pacers to the come from behind victory.  The Knicks ultimately came back to win the next two games and the series.  Miller was a tri-captain and leading scorer of the USA Basketball team that won the gold medal at the 1994 FIBA World Championship .  , Mark Jackson joined the team in an off-season trade with the Los Angeles Clippers , giving the team a steady hand at the point guard position that had been lacking in recent years. The Pacers enjoyed a 52–30 campaign in 1994–95 , giving them their first Central Division title and first 50+ win season since the ABA days. The team swept the Hawks in the first round , before another meeting with the rival Knicks in the Conference semifinals. Again, it was up to Miller to provide some fireworks. This time, with the Pacers down six points with 16.4 seconds remaining in Game 1, Miller scored eight points in 8.9 seconds to help secure a two-point victory.  The Pacers beat the Knicks in seven games. They pushed the Magic to seven games before falling in the Eastern Conference Finals.  , In the 1997–98 NBA season Larry Bird coached the team, under whom they posted a new franchise record, finishing 58–24, a 19-game improvement from the previous season. Chris Mullin joined the team in the off-season and immediately became a valuable part of the Pacers lineup—and starting small forward. Assistant coaches Rick Carlisle , in charge of the offense, and Dick Harter , who coached the defense, were key in getting the most out of the Pacers' role players such as Dale Davis , a young Antonio Davis and Derrick McKey . Miller and Rik Smits both made the All-Star team that year, and in the playoffs , the Pacers breezed past the Cleveland Cavaliers and New York Knicks before falling to the Chicago Bulls in a seven-game Eastern Conference Final. , In the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season, the Pacers won the Central Division with a 33–17 record and swept the Milwaukee Bucks and Philadelphia 76ers before falling to the Knicks in a six-game Eastern Conference finals. The Pacers traded forward Antonio Davis to the Toronto Raptors in exchange for first-round draft choice Jonathan Bender , which remains to this day a subject of controversy among Pacers fans. But in the playoffs , after a 56–26 regular season , the Pacers survived the upset-minded Milwaukee Bucks in round one, handled the Philadelphia 76ers in the second round and finally broke through to the NBA Finals by virtue of a six-game East Finals victory over the New York Knicks . , Their first NBA Finals appearance was against the Los Angeles Lakers , who ended Indiana's championship hopes in six games. However, the Pacers dealt Los Angeles their worst playoff defeat up to that time by a margin of 33 points in game five.  , In the midseason of 2001–02 , the Pacers made a blockbuster trade with the Chicago Bulls that sent Jalen Rose and Travis Best to Chicago in exchange for Brad Miller , Ron Artest , Kevin Ollie and Ron Mercer . Miller and Artest would, in the next few years, go on to be All-Stars for the Pacers. The trade bolstered a team that had been floundering, and the Pacers managed to return to the playoffs , where they pushed the top-seeded New Jersey Nets to five games before losing Game 5 in double overtime. Jermaine O'Neal made his first of what would be several All-Star appearances in his Pacers career. , Toward the end of a Pacers victory over the Detroit Pistons at The Palace of Auburn Hills on November 19, 2004, the Pacers' Ron Artest committed a hard foul against Ben Wallace . Wallace retaliated with a hard push, and the situation escalated to a full-scale brawl , with fans and several Pacers taking part. While Artest defiantly laid atop the scorer's table, Piston fan John Green threw a cup of Diet Coke at Artest, causing him to charge into the stands. Stephen Jackson followed him into the stands while Jermaine O'Neal struck a fan who came onto the court. The game was called off with 46 seconds left on the clock and the Pacers left the floor amid a shower of beer and other beverages that rained down from the stands. , Several of the involved players were suspended by NBA Commissioner David Stern . Artest was suspended for the rest of the regular season and playoffs, a total of 73 games—the longest suspension for an on-court incident in NBA history. Other suspensions included Jackson (suspended for 30 games), O'Neal (25 games), Wallace (6 games) and the Pacers' Anthony Johnson (5 games) (O'Neal's suspension was later reduced to 15 games by arbitrator Roger Kaplan, a decision that was upheld by U.S. District Judge George B. Daniels). O'Neal was charged with two counts of assault and battery, while Artest, Jackson, Johnson and David Harrison were charged with one count each. , After the brawl and suspensions that followed, the Pacers fell downward into the Central Division. They went from a legitimate title contender to a team that hovered around .500 in winning percentage. The Pistons eventually became the Central Division champions. Despite the difficulties with the suspensions and injuries, the Pacers earned a sixth seed in the playoffs with a record of 44–38. An important reason for their strong finish was the re-acquisition of Dale Davis , who had been released by the New Orleans Hornets after being traded there by the Golden State Warriors . He played the final 25 games of the regular season and every playoff game, contributing a strong presence at center. And Davis' signing coincided with an injury to Jermaine O'Neal that would knock him out for virtually the remainder of the regular season—indeed, O'Neal's first missed game due to his injury was Davis' first game back with the Pacers. , Despite the adversity they had gone through, the Pacers made the playoffs for the 13th time in 14 years. In the first round, Indiana defeated the Atlantic Division champion Boston Celtics in seven games, winning Game 7 in Boston by the decisive margin of 97–70, just the third time the Celtics had dropped a Game 7 at home. The Pacers then advanced to the second-round against the Detroit Pistons , in a rematch of the previous year's Eastern Conference Finals. The series featured games back at The Palace of Auburn Hills , the scene of the brawl that many assumed at the time had effectively ended the Pacers' season. After losing Game 1, the Pacers won the next two games to take a 2–1 lead. However, the Pacers could not repeat their victories against the Pistons and lost the next 3 games, losing the series 4–2. The final game (Game 6) was on May 19, 2005; Reggie Miller , in his final NBA game, scored 27 points and received a huge standing ovation from the crowd. Despite Miller's effort, the Pacers lost, sending Miller into retirement without an NBA Championship in his 18-year career, all with the Pacers. Miller had his No. 31 jersey retired by the Pacers on March 30, 2006 when the Pacers played the Phoenix Suns .  , Despite the loss of Miller, the Artest saga, and many key injuries the Pacers made the playoffs in 2006 for the 14th time in 15 years. They also were the only road team to win Game 1 of a first-round playoff series. However New Jersey won game 2 to tie the series at 1–1 heading back to Indiana. In game 3 Jermaine O'Neal scored 37 points as the Pacers regained a 2–1 series lead. The Nets, however, won games four and five to take a 3–2 series lead. In Game 6 Anthony Johnson scored 40 points but the Pacers' season came to an end as the Nets won 96–90. , The Pacers finished the 2006–07 season as one of the worst seasons in team history. For the Pacers, who finished with a 35–47 record, nearly everything that could have gone wrong did. The turning point of the season would be an 11-game losing streak that started around the all-star break. Injuries to Jermaine O'Neal and Marquis Daniels, a lack of a solid back up point guard, the blockbuster trade midway through the season that interrupted the team chemistry, poor defensive efforts, and being the NBA's worst offensive team were the main reasons leading to the team's struggles. The April 15 loss to New Jersey Nets knocked the Pacers out of the playoffs for the first time since the 1996–1997 season. , On April 10, 2007, the Pacers announced the firing of coach Rick Carlisle , with the Pacers' first losing record in ten seasons being the main reason for the coach's dismissal. Pacers President Larry Bird noted that Carlisle had the opportunity to return to the Pacers franchise in another role. Later, Carlisle opted to leave and took a broadcasting job with ESPN before returning to coach the Dallas Mavericks in 2008 (where he would win a championship in 2011). On May 31, 2007, Jim O'Brien was named Carlisle's successor. O'Brien made it clear that he intended to take the Pacers back to the playoffs in the 2007–08 season, but he didn't, and didn't in his tenure. He also made it known that he favored a more up-tempo, fast-paced style as opposed to Carlisle's slower, more meticulous style of coaching. Many people have taken note that this style, while exciting at times, failed to produce a winning record and O'Brien's inability to change his style to better suit his talent available has hurt the team. , Despite missing the playoffs in back-to-back seasons for the first time since the '80s, the 2007–08 season displayed many signs of growth in the team, especially towards the end of the season. Off-court legal distraction from Jamaal Tinsley , Marquis Daniels , and Shawne Williams in the middle of the season did not help the Pacers struggles, and injuries to Tinsley and Jermaine O'Neal damaged the Pacers' already weak defense and left almost all point guard duties to recently acquired Travis Diener, who saw minimal minutes on his previous NBA teams. Despite this, and a 36–46 record, the Pacers had a very strong finish to the season, which included a desperate attempt to steal the 8th seed from the Atlanta Hawks , and dramatic improvement in forwards Danny Granger and Mike Dunleavy . Both Granger and Dunleavy were involved in the voting for Most Improved Player, with Dunleavy finishing in the top 10. The two were also the first Pacer pair to score 1500 points each in a single season since Reggie Miller and Detlef Schrempf did it in the early 90s. , In April of the 2007–08 Season, Donnie Walsh , Pacers Sports & Entertainment CEO & President, left the Indiana Pacers to join the New York Knicks . All of Walsh's basketball-related duties were given to Pacers' President of Basketball Operations Larry Bird . Walsh's business-related roles were given to co-owner Herb Simon and Jim Morris, who was promoted to President of Pacers Sports & Entertainment. , During the 2009–2010 season, Pacers forward Tyler Hansbrough (drafted in 2009) suffered a season-ending ear injury and without center Jeff Foster , the Pacers again fell into another season under .500 and missed the playoffs for 4 years in a row. Despite another disappointing season, the Pacers managed to sweep the waning Detroit Pistons for the first time in 5 years, and the abysmal New Jersey Nets for the first time in 20. The team showed signs of life near the end of the season, winning nearly all of their last 14 games. , In May 2010, after completing his rookie season, guard A. J. Price suffered a knee injury during a charity pick-up game that would require surgery. His expected rehabilitation was to last between 4–6 months, to be back just in time for training camp. , In the 2010 NBA Draft , the Pacers selected forward/guard Paul George with the 10th overall pick. In the second round, they drafted guard Lance Stephenson , as well as forward Ryan Reid . The draft rights to Reid were traded on draft night to the Oklahoma City Thunder in exchange to the rights to forward/center Magnum Rolle . The Pacers signed George to his rookie contract on July 1, 2010. Stephenson signed a multi-year contract with the team on July 22. Just before training camp, Rolle was signed, along with big man Lance Allred . Both were cut before the regular season began. , On August 11, 2010, the Pacers acquired guard Darren Collison and swingman James Posey from the New Orleans Hornets in a four-team, five-player deal. Troy Murphy was dealt to the New Jersey Nets in that trade. , In the 2010–2011 season, the team went 2–3 in the first five games. On November 9 in a home game against Denver, the team scored 54 points in the 3rd quarter alone, shooting 20–21 in the process, on the way to a 144–113 rout of the Nuggets. Led by Mike Dunleavy's 24 points in the period, the team set a franchise record for most points in a quarter and was only four points short of the all-time NBA record for points in a quarter (58) set in the 1970s. , On January 30, 2011, the Pacers relieved Jim O'Brien of his coaching duties and named assistant coach Frank Vogel interim head coach. , On the NBA's trade deadline on February 24, 2011, numerous sports news outlets, including ESPN , reported that the Pacers had agreed to a three-team trade that would have sent Josh McRoberts to the Memphis Grizzlies and Brandon Rush to the New Orleans Hornets , while the Pacers would have received O.J. Mayo from the Grizzlies in return, and the Hornets would have sent an unidentified player to the Grizzlies. However, the trading period expired at 3:00 pm EST , and the trade paperwork did not reach the NBA's main offices for approval until 3:02 pm. Thus, the trade was canceled and all aforementioned players remained with their original teams. , With a victory over the Washington Wizards on April 6, 2011, the Pacers clinched their first playoff berth since 2006. In the first round, they were defeated by the No. 1 seed Chicago Bulls in five games. Despite a lopsided comparison in terms of the two teams' win-loss records, three of the four Pacers losses were close, losing games 1–3 by an average of five points. , The Pacers named Vogel their permanent head coach on July 7, 2011. They acquired George Hill from the San Antonio Spurs on draft night . After the lockout, the Pacers signed former two-time All-Star power forward David West to a two-year deal. These new players contributed to the Pacers' record of 21-12 at the All Star break. The Pacers acquired another key piece in Leandro Barbosa from the Toronto Raptors at the trade deadline, mid-season. , At the end of the 2011-12 season, the team, led in scoring by Danny Granger , clinched the playoffs as the third seed in the Eastern Conference. They finished with a 42-24 record, their best record since their 2003-04 season. On May 8, 2012, the Pacers defeated the Orlando Magic 105-87 to win their first playoff series since 2005 and would go on to play the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Semifinals . On May 15, 2012 they defeated Miami to tie the second round series at 1-1. On May 17, they again beat Miami 94-75 to take the series lead 2-1. However, despite a hard fought series between the two, the Heat won Game 6 to close the series at 4-2. , The following season, Granger was sidelined by a knee injury and managed to only play 5 games. Granger made his return during the 2013-2014 season, however failed to regain his form of the previous seasons, Granger was then traded to the Philadelphia 76ers for G Evan Turner and F Lavoy Allen in a swap that took place approximately 30 minutes before the trade deadline.  , On June 26, 2012, general manager, David Morway officially resigned.  The following day, president of basketball operations, Larry Bird stepped down. Bird and Morway were officially replaced by Donnie Walsh and Kevin Pritchard , respectively.  Walsh returned to the organization after spending the previous three seasons in the Knicks' front office. Pritchard was promoted by the Pacers after serving as the team's director of player personnel. In the 2012 NBA Draft , the Pacers selected Miles Plumlee with the 26th pick and acquired Orlando Johnson , the 36th pick from the Sacramento Kings . , On April 7, 2013, the Pacers clinched their first Central Division championship since the 2003-04 season. They finished the 2012-13 season with a 49-32 record, the 3rd seed in the Eastern Conference and beat the Atlanta Hawks in the first round of the playoffs. The Pacers then beat the New York Knicks in six games to advance to the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since 2004 to face the defending champs, the Miami Heat .  The Pacers lost Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals on May 22, 2013 in overtime 103-102.  On May 24, 2013 in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals, the Pacers were victorious by a score of 97-93. The game was clinched for Indiana, after David West was able to deflect a pass from LeBron James . The team headed home to Indianapolis where they had been a perfect 6-0 in the playoffs. The Heat won Game 3 in Indianapolis on May 26, 2013, with contributions from role players Udonis Haslem and Chris Andersen , and won 114-96.  The Pacers bounced back in Game 4 - with a strong contribution from Lance Stephenson - and won 99-92. The Pacers lost Game 5 in Miami on May 30, but won Game 6 at home on June 1, extending the series to Game 7. The Pacers were defeated by Miami, 99-76. , One year after stepping down, Larry Bird returned as president of basketball operations. Donnie Walsh , who was brought back to hold the position for Bird, was named a consultant for the Pacers.  In the 2013 NBA Draft , the Pacers selected Solomon Hill with the 23rd overall pick. During the 2013 off-season, the Pacers made strengthening their bench a priority, resulting in the acquisitions of point guard C. J. Watson , and forwards Chris Copeland and Luis Scola , the latter being acquired via trade with the Phoenix Suns . , The 2013-2014 season saw the Pacers jump to an explosive first half of a season, as they started the season 33-7 thanks to the rise of Paul George and Lance Stephenson.. There were talks about the Pacers becoming the next team to hit the 70 win mark, which had only been achieved by the 1995-1996 Chicago Bulls. Paul George and Roy Hibbert were selected for the All Star Game. However, after the All Star Break, the Pacers collapsed. After starting the season 40-11, the Pacers crashed and stumbled to a 16-15 finish, with rumors of fighting in the locker room being a potential cause for the meltdown. Regardless, they managed to hold onto their first seed in the East, finished the season with a 56-26 record. , The Pacers started off the playoffs against the Atlanta Hawks, whom managed to secure an eighth seed in the playoffs with a 38-44 record. In Game 1, the Pacers suffered a devastating loss at home to the Hawks, 101-93. The Pacers bounced back in Game 2, winning 101-85. With the series shifting to Atlanta, the Hawks won Game 3 by 13 points. Indiana then took back the homecourt advantage in the series, winning Game 4 by 3 points in Atlanta. Back in Indianapolis, the Pacers jumped out to an early lead, but the Hawks had a monstrous second quarter, outscoring the Pacers 41-19. With the hometown crowd behind their backs, the Pacers cut the once 30-point lead to 9 late in the fourth quarter, but the rally wasn't enough to win Game 5, losing 107-97. Three days later in Atlanta, the Hawks jumped out to an early 10 point lead, but Indiana led at the half by five. The Pacers got the lead up to nine in the third quarter, but the Hawks came back and had a three-point lead at the end of the quarter. The game was back and forth throughout the fourth quarter. With three minutes remaining and the Pacers down five, it looked as if their season would come to an end. Then, behind David West, the Pacers ended the game on a 16-4 and won the game by seven to extend the series to a seventh game in Indianapolis. On May 3, 2014, the Pacers hosted a Game 7 at home for the first time in franchise history. A sellout crowd of 18,165 came to watch the Pacers and Hawks play in a win or go home situation. Atlanta led by as many as six in the first quarter, but the Pacers had the lead at the end of the first by a point. Throughout the second and third quarters, the Pacers went on a 24-6 run to give the Pacers a 17-point lead, and Indiana never turned back, winning the game 92-80. The Pacers then defeated Washington in 6 games in the semi-finals, then a rematch with the second-seeded and defending champion Miami in the Eastern Conference Finals. The Pacers surprised many critics, taking Game 1 in the Eastern Conference Finals with a score of 107-95. Unfortunately for the Pacers they ended up losing the next 3 to the Heat before managing to avoid elimination in Game 5 with a close win over the Heat. In the game, LeBron James got into early foul trouble and played less than 30 minutes, while Paul George exploded in the second half to finish the night with 37 points. The game was notable for the infamous incident where Lance Stephenson blew into LeBron James' ear. Despite the win, the Pacers were eliminated in Game 6 by the Miami Heat for the third straight year. , On August 1, 2014, Paul George, who was playing in a Team USA scrimmage in preparation for the FIBA World Cup, suffered a catastrophic open fracture to his right leg (Tib/Fib) while trying to defend James Harden on a fast break. As he tried to defend Harden from advancing to the rim, George's leg caught on the stanchion of the hoop, and fractured. He was stretchered off of the court. Many described his injury as one of the worst and most graphic injuries they'd seen since the Kevin Ware incident. A day later, George successfully underwent surgery. He was expected to miss the entire 2014–2015 season. On April 5, 2015 Paul George returned from his injury to play in a game against the Miami Heat . George shot 5 of 12 from the field and tallied two steals, two rebounds and two assists in a winning effort. , The Indiana Pacers play their home games at Bankers Life Fieldhouse , which opened in 1999. Bankers Life Fieldhouse is located in downtown Indianapolis . It is owned and operated by the Capital Improvement Board, City of Indianapolis , Indiana and its groundbreaking was on July 22, 1997 by Ellerbe Becket Architects & Engineers. Formerly known as Conseco Fieldhouse, the arena officially opened on November 6, 1999 and adopted its current name on December 22, 2011. It seats 18,165 for basketball games. Bankers Life Fieldhouse is also the home of the WNBA 's Indiana Fever , who are also owned by Herb Simon . Additionally, it hosts the Big Ten Men's Basketball Tournament and hosted the 2011 NCAA Women's Basketball Final Four . It hosts concerts and other events as well. The Fieldhouse is considered one of the best arenas in the NBA, being rated the No. 1 venue in the NBA according to the Sports Business Journal/Sports Business Daily Reader Survey. Before moving into Bankers Life Fieldhouse, the Pacers played their games at Market Square Arena from 1974–1999 and at the Indiana State Fairgrounds Coliseum from 1967–1974. , The Indiana Pacers colors are navy blue, gold, silver, and white. The Pacers wear the usual white home uniform with navy blue and gold trim. Their road uniform is navy blue with gold trim. They also have a third uniform which is gold with navy blue trim. During the 1983 season , they wore the gold home uniform with blue and white trim. From 1997-2005 the Pacers sported pinstripe uniforms. One of their most iconic uniforms, worn from 1990–97, and the uniform that launched Reggie Miller into superstardom, was designed by American track and field athlete Florence Griffith-Joyner , and featured a modern typeset that resembled Helvetica . The jerseys were often referred to as the "Flo-Jos" by Pacers fans. , , The Chicago Bulls and the Indiana Pacers rivalry in the National Basketball Association (NBA) begins with the two playing in the Central Division . This rivalry is best known from the match-ups in the 1990s in which Michael Jordan and Reggie Miller would go head-to-head. The rivalry was renewed when the two teams faced each other in the first round of the 2011 NBA Playoffs . , The Pacers and Pistons met for the first time in the 1990 Playoffs , the Pistons swept the Pacers in three straight games on their way to their second straight NBA championship . But the rivalry truly began in the 2003-04 season . The Pacers finished with a league best 61 wins and were led by Jermaine O'Neal , Ron Artest , and Reggie Miller , and coached by Rick Carlisle . Carlisle had been fired by Detroit at the end of the previous season. Detroit was led by Chauncey Billups , Ben Wallace , Rasheed Wallace , Tayshaun Prince , and Richard Hamilton , and coached by Larry Brown . Indiana won the first 3 matchups in the regular season, before being defeated by the Pistons in the final regular-season meeting at the Palace. That was also the first time the two met after Rasheed Wallace was traded to Detroit. , They met in the 2004 Eastern Conference Finals. Indiana narrowly won Game 1, thanks to some late heroics from Miller. Rasheed, unimpressed, stated "They Will Not Win Game 2" during an interview before the second game (locally known as the "Guaran-Sheed" victory). Late in Game 2, Detroit held a two-point lead, Billups turned over the ball, and Miller appeared to have an uncontested lay-up that would have tied the game. However, before Miller could score, he was chased down by Prince, who leapt from behind and blocked the shot. Near the end of Game 6, when Detroit held a slight lead, Artest committed a flagrant foul on Hamilton, which nearly caused tempers to boil over. Detroit won the series 4-2, and went on to win the NBA title. , On November 19, 2004, at The Palace of Auburn Hills , what has become known as the Pacers–Pistons brawl took place. All involved were suspended for varying lengths. Artest, who started it, carried the longest penalty: the entire season. , That year teams split the four regular season meetings. They met in the Eastern Conference Semifinals and split the first two games. The Pacers, blew an 18-point lead, but still won Game 3 in Indianapolis . However, just as he did a year earlier, Rasheed promised a win in Game 4 saying, "When we return, we will be tied at 2." The Pistons won Games 4 and 5. The Pacers, knew a loss would lead to Miller's retirement, fought hard, but fell to the Pistons 88–79. , During the 1990s, the Knicks and Pacers were perennial playoff teams. They met in the playoffs 6 times from 1993–2000, fueling a rivalry epitomized by the enmity between Miller and prominent Knick fan Spike Lee . The rivalry was likened by Miller to the Hatfield–McCoy feud ,  and described by The New York Times , in 1998 as being "as combustible as any in the league".  , A recent rivalry with the Miami Heat was triggered with the team in the Eastern Conference Semifinals of the 2012 NBA Playoffs . Although the two previously met in the 2004 NBA Playoffs (when Indiana won 4–2), As of 2014 [update] , the only two players still left from either team are Dwyane Wade and Udonis Haslem of the Heat. Both head coaches were fined for statements made relating to the officiating: Frank Vogel accused the Heat of flopping before the series started, while Erik Spoelstra took offense to what he perceived to be deliberate head-hunting of his players on the part of the Pacers. Indiana took a 2–1 lead after Miami's Chris Bosh was sidelined with an abdominal strain. Powered by LeBron James and Dwyane Wade , Miami won three straight games to take the series, 4–2. The series was marked by several suspensions, flagrant fouls, and confrontations between the players: Tyler Hansbrough 's flagrant foul on Dwyane Wade (which drew blood), Udonis Haslem's retaliatory flagrant foul on Hansborough (which led to Haslem's Game 6 suspension), Wade colliding with Darren Collison in transition, Juwan Howard confronting Lance Stephenson over the latter's flashing of the choke sign to James, and Dexter Pittman elbowing Stephenson in the neck (which led to his own three-game suspension). Indiana's Danny Granger received technical fouls in three consecutive games for his confrontations with Heat players; he stripped James of his headband in Game 2 while attempting to block a shot, pulled the back of James' jersey in Game 3 while trying to stop a fast-break, and chest-bumped Wade in Game 4 after the latter was fouled by Roy Hibbert . , The following season saw improvements for both teams, from Miami's acquisition of Ray Allen and Chris Andersen , to the emergence of Paul George and Lance Stephenson . Notably, it was after the Heat lost to the Pacers that they compiled a 27-game winning streak; the last time the Heat lost two in a row in the year were the games against Indiana and Portland. During the waning minutes of Game 6 in the Semifinals between the Pacers and the New York Knicks , the Pacers' fans were chanting "Beat The Heat" as their team beat their old New York rivals. True to form, the Heat and the Pacers met in the Conference Finals of the 2013 NBA Playoffs on May 22, 2013. Several instances of physicality became prominent in the series: Shane Battier received an offensive foul for throwing his knee at Hibbert's midsection; Hibbert claimed that it was intentional dirty play on the part of Battier. Andersen suffered a bloodied nose after colliding with David West . Ian Mahinmi received a retroactive flagrant foul for a grab of James' arm. Norris Cole latched a hand on West's groin area as he tried to slip through West. Wade received a retroactive flagrant foul for hitting Stephenson in the head, another incident that the Pacers, notably Paul George, felt was a dirty play. The Heat survived Game 1 on a James game-winning layup, while the Pacers came back to tie the series at 1–1 after forcing James into two late fourth-quarter turnovers for Game 2. In Game 3, the Heat set a team record for points in a postseason half with 70. It was the first time the Pacers had given up 70 points since 1992. Allen's single turnover was the least ever suffered by the Heat in a first half. Their five total turnovers is tied for the fewest in franchise history. The Game 3 victory marked the first time that an NBA team had won five straight road games by double digits. The Heat won the series 4–3, with a 99–76 win in game 7.  In 2014 , The Pacers and Heat renewed their rivalry in a second consecutive East Finals match up with the Heat eliminating the Pacers again. , The Pacers hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who isn't signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.  This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. , 1 As head coach; the number represents his 529 victories coaching the Pacers . , Except as noted, all players and coaches listed here were inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in the same role in which they are listed.. , There have been 13 head coaches for the Pacers franchise. Larry Staverman was the first coach of the team in 1967, when the team was in the ABA. Coach Bobby Leonard has the most wins in franchise history, with 529 in his 12 seasons with the team. Dick Versace led the Pacers through the subpar years and Bob Hill got the Pacers back to the playoffs and into contention. Then Larry Brown joined the Pacers franchise and led the team to many playoff appearances after the acquisition of star Reggie Miller . Larry Bird took over the team in 1997 and coached until 2000. Bird took the Pacers to their only NBA Finals appearance in the 1999–2000 season. The current head coach of the Pacers is Frank Vogel . , NBA Defensive Player of the Year , NBA Rookie of the Year , NBA Sixth Man of the Year , NBA Most Improved Player of the Year , NBA Coach of the Year , NBA Executive of the Year , All-Star East Head Coach , ABA Most Valuable Player Award , ABA Playoffs Most Valuable Player , ABA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award , NBA All-Star selections , All-NBA Second Team , All-NBA Third Team , All-ABA First Team , All-ABA Second Team , NBA All-Defensive First Team , NBA All-Defensive Second Team , ABA All-Defensive Team , NBA Rookie First Team , NBA Rookie Second Team , ABA All-Rookie Team , NBA Slam Dunk Contest  The Milwaukee Bucks are an American basketball team based in Milwaukee , Wisconsin . They are part of the Central Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The team was founded in 1968 as an expansion team , and played at the BMO Harris Bradley Center . Former U.S. Senator Herb Kohl was the long-time owner of the team, with John Hammond as current general manager; as of April 16, 2014 a group led by billionaire hedge fund managers Wesley Edens and Marc Lasry agreed to purchase the team from Kohl, a sale which was approved by the owners of the NBA and its Board of Governors a month later on May 16.  The team is currently valued at $600 million according to Forbes ,  ranking last in the league. , The Bucks have won one league title ( 1971 ), two conference titles ( 1971 and 1974 ), and thirteen division titles (1971–74, 1976, 1980–86, 2001). They have featured such notable players as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , Sidney Moncrief , Oscar Robertson , Bob Lanier , Glenn "Big Dog" Robinson , Ray Allen , Andrew Bogut , Michael Redd , Terry Cummings , Vin Baker , Jon McGlocklin , Brandon Jennings , Toni Kukoč , Giannis Antetokounmpo , Jabari Parker , and Anthony Mason . , , , The Milwaukee Bucks were formed in 1968. On January 22, 1968, the National Basketball Association (NBA) awarded a franchise to Milwaukee Professional Sports and Services, Inc. (Milwaukee Pro), a group headed by Wesley Pavalon and Marvin Fishman. In October, the Bucks played their first NBA regular-season game against the Chicago Bulls before a Milwaukee Arena crowd of 8,467. As is typical with expansion teams, the Bucks' first season ( 1968–69 ) was a struggle. Their first victory came in their sixth game as the Bucks beat the Detroit Pistons 134–118; they won only 26 more games in their first year. The Bucks' record that year earned them a coin flip against their expansion cousins, the Phoenix Suns , to see who would get the first pick in the upcoming draft. It was a foregone conclusion that the first pick in the draft would be Lew Alcindor of UCLA . The Bucks won the coin flip, but had to win a bidding war with the upstart American Basketball Association (ABA) to secure him.  , While it was expected [ by whom? ] that Alcindor would make the Bucks respectable almost immediately, no one expected what happened in 1969–70 . They finished with a 56–26 record – a nearly exact reversal of the previous year and good enough for the second-best record in the league, behind the New York Knicks . The 29-game improvement was the best in league history – a record which would stand for 10 years until the Boston Celtics jumped from 29 wins in 1978–79 to 61 in 1979–80 (the difference again being a highly touted rookie, Larry Bird ). The Bucks defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in five games in the Eastern semifinals, only to be dispatched in five by the Knicks in the Eastern finals. Alcindor was a runaway selection for NBA Rookie of the Year . , The following season , the Bucks got an unexpected gift when they acquired Oscar Robertson , known as the "Big O", in a trade with the Cincinnati Royals . Subsequently, in only their third season, the Bucks finished 66–16 – the second-most wins in NBA history at the time, and still the most in franchise history. During the regular season, the Bucks recorded a then-NBA record 20-game win streak . They then steamrolled through the playoffs with a dominating 12–2 record, winning the NBA Championship on April 30, 1971, by sweeping the Baltimore Bullets in four games. By winning it all in only their third season, the Bucks became the fastest expansion team in NBA history to win the championship, however four decades later, it remains the only title in club history. , The Bucks remained a powerhouse for the first half of the 1970s. In 1972, they recorded their third consecutive 60-win season, the first NBA team to do so. During the year, Lew Alcindor converted to Islam and changed his name to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar . Milwaukee beat the Warriors in the playoffs 4–1, but lost the conference finals to Los Angeles 4–2. Injuries resulted in an early 1973 playoff exit, but the Bucks were back in the 1974 NBA Finals against the Boston Celtics . In game six of the series, Jabbar made his famous " sky hook " shot to end a classic double-overtime victory for the Bucks. The Bucks lost game seven and the series to the Celtics; as of 2014, they had not returned to the NBA Finals . As the 1974–1975 season began, Abdul-Jabbar suffered a hand injury and the team got off to a 3–13 start. After his return, other injuries befell Milwaukee, sending them to the bottom of their division with 38 wins and 44 losses. When the season ended, Abdul-Jabbar made the stunning announcement that he no longer wished to play for the Bucks, stating that he needed the big city, requesting a trade to either Los Angeles or New York. The front office was unable to convince him otherwise and on June 16, 1975, the Bucks pulled a mega-trade by sending Abdul-Jabbar to the Lakers for Elmore Smith , Junior Bridgeman , Brian Winters and David Meyers . The trade triggered a series of events that led to a change in the team's ownership. Jim Fitzgerald , the Bucks largest stockholder, opposed the trade and wanted to sell his stock. Although Fitzgerald was the largest stockholder, he did not own enough stock to control the team. , After the deal, the Bucks had several seasons in transition, but most of these players would go on to help the team. After being sold to cable television executive Jim Fitzgerald and several partners in 1976, the Bucks would enter into another era of greatness. It began with Don Nelson who became head coach in November 1976 after Larry Costello abruptly resigned. In the 1977 draft, the Bucks had three first round picks and drafted Kent Benson , Marques Johnson and Ernie Grunfeld . Johnson would become a staple in the Bucks for years to come. Rookie Sidney Moncrief made his debut in 1979. Don Nelson went on to win two NBA Coach of the Year awards with the Bucks, both during seasons where the team won division titles, in 1983 and 1985. , On October 18, 1977, Jabbar, playing with L.A., punched Benson during a game. Jabbar broke his hand in the process.  Benson had been aggressive under the boards and Jabbar, a martial arts blackbelt , snapped. Jabbar was fined $5,000 by the NBA and missed the next 20 games. Meanwhile, Benson never played as aggressively again and the Bucks traded him to the Detroit Pistons in 1980 for veteran center Bob Lanier to fill in the hole left by the departure of Jabbar. They then won the Midwest Division title in 1980. After losing to Seattle in the semi-finals, the Bucks moved to the Eastern Conference 's Central Division . , There, they would win six straight division titles and have .500 seasons for the next 11 years. Within those years, the Bucks became perennial Eastern Conference contenders, primarily due to the strong play of Moncrief, Paul Pressey , Craig Hodges and the arrival of Terry Cummings , Ricky Pierce and Jack Sikma from trades with the Los Angeles Clippers and Seattle SuperSonics respectively. However, the Bucks were unable to make it to the NBA Finals again, being eliminated by either the Celtics or the Sixers each time. , For much of the 1970s the Bucks colors were forest green, deep red and white. In 1978, they added various shades of green to the uniforms, and in 1985, they eliminated red from the team colors. , Noteworthy for the 1980s Bucks is that in 1983 they became the first, and until 2003 , only team in NBA history to sweep the Boston Celtics in a best-of-seven playoffs series, being the first team to meet and defeat Michael Jordan in a playoffs series (during Jordan's rookie year), and hosting Julius Erving 's final NBA game in the 1987 NBA Playoffs , which would see the Bucks advancing with a game five first-round playoff victory. , In 1985, Fitzgerald and his partners (one of which was Stuart Shadel) decided to sell the Bucks. He was having health problems and some of his investors wanted to get out. The Bucks were playing in the smallest arena in the NBA and the city did not want to build a new one. Milwaukee businessman and U.S. Senator Herb Kohl bought the Bucks after fears that out-of-town investors could buy the team and move it out of Milwaukee. Before the transaction was complete, Jane and Lloyd Pettit of Milwaukee announced they were donating a new arena called the Bradley Center . In 2003, after considering selling the team, Kohl announced that he had decided against selling the Bucks to Michael Jordan and would "continue to own them, improve them and commit them to remaining in Wisconsin". , In 2012, the arena sold the naming rights of the building to the BMO Harris Bank division of Bank of Montreal , which had purchased the assets of M&I Bank a year earlier, and after the heirs to the Bradley fortune gave their approval, and was renamed the "BMO Harris Bradley Center". , For most of the 1990s, the Bucks franchise was mired in mediocrity under coaches Frank Hamblen , Mike Dunleavy , and Chris Ford . From 1991 through 1998, the Bucks suffered seven straight seasons of losing records. During this period, the Bucks drafted Glenn Robinson with the first overall pick in the 1994 NBA Draft and in 1996 acquired rookie Ray Allen in a draft day trade with the Minnesota Timberwolves. Both players would have prominent roles in the Bucks resurgence during the late 1990s. , After the franchise's 25th anniversary in 1993, the Bucks overhauled their logo and uniforms. The colors were green, purple, and silver. The old logo, which featured a cartoonish deer, was replaced in favor of a more realistic one. The primary color scheme was altered as well, when red was supplanted by purple. Purple road uniforms replaced the former green away uniforms. , In 1997, the Bucks sent all-star forward Vin Baker in a three-team trade to the Seattle SuperSonics , and they would acquire Cleveland Cavaliers guard Terrell Brandon and forward Tyrone Hill . They also traded their tenth overall pick Danny Fortson , guard Johnny Newman , and center Joe Wolf to the Denver Nuggets for center Ervin Johnson . The 1997-98 Bucks finished their season with a 36-46 record, yet failing to make the playoffs for the seventh consecutive time. , After a decade of dwelling near the bottom of the NBA's standings, the Bucks looked to add credibility to their basketball operations. In 1998, the team hired veteran coach George Karl , who had reached the NBA Finals with the Seattle SuperSonics . Under the leadership of Karl and general manager Ernie Grunfeld , and with the steady addition of talent such as Tim Thomas and Sam Cassell , the Bucks developed into an elite team in the Eastern Conference. The nucleus of the "big three"—consisting of Ray Allen , Cassell, and Robinson—along with Karl, created a successful renaissance era in Milwaukee. The team reached its zenith in 2000–2001, winning 52 games and the Central Division title. That year the Bucks reached the 2001 Eastern Conference finals, which they lost in seven games. , After coming close to a finals appearance in 2001, the Bucks sought to make key off-season player additions to put the team in the NBA Finals. Behind the strong encouragement of George Karl, the Bucks acquired forward Anthony Mason at the beginning of the 2001–02 season . On paper, this move made the Bucks the team to beat in the East. However, Mason battled with his weight and had a tough time finding his role.  The Bucks, who at the season's midway point were the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference, began to free-fall. The collapse culminated with a loss to the Detroit Pistons on the final night of the season, which eliminated the Bucks from the playoffs. The fallout created tension between the team's players and coach, resulting in a trade of Glenn Robinson to Atlanta (for Toni Kukoc and a 2003 first-round draft pick, used to select T. J. Ford ). , During the 2002–03 season , the Bucks traded Ray Allen and backup Ronald "Flip" Murray to the Seattle SuperSonics for Gary Payton and Desmond Mason . The trade allowed emerging star Michael Redd to see increased playing time, and with Payton in the backcourt, they finished the season with a 42–40 record. The Bucks made the playoffs, but lost in the first round to the New Jersey Nets in six games. That offseason, team leaders Sam Cassell and Ervin Johnson were traded to Minnesota (for Joe Smith ). Payton left via free agency, after playing only 28 games for the Bucks. Coach Karl's tenure also ended after the season. Within a one-year period, the team had lost the coach and players most responsible for the team's success during that era. , Under the direction of new general manager Larry Harris , the Bucks struggled with inconsistency and injury for the next six years. During that period, they reached the playoffs twice, first under coach Terry Porter in 2004 and then under Terry Stotts in 2006 . In both instances, they were defeated by the Detroit Pistons in five games. During that period, Michael Redd blossomed into an all-star and a perimeter shooting threat, becoming the new "face of the franchise".  The Bucks received the first pick in the 2005 NBA draft , and used it to select center Andrew Bogut . Bogut struggled with both inconsistency and injuries in his first four years in Milwaukee, but over time became a key contributor to the Bucks. , In 2006, the team finished 40–42, last in their division, 24 games behind Detroit, but still made the playoffs in a season where every team in their division did. They were paired as the eighth seed versus the 64–18 conference-leading Pistons. They won game three at home, but lost the other four in a 4–1 series loss. , In March 2008, the Bucks' fans selected the franchise's 40th Anniversary Team, which included notable players such as Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Oscar Robertson, Ray Allen, Sidney Moncrief, and Michael Redd.  , Also in March, the Bucks announced that they would not renew general manager Larry Harris 's contract, which was to expire in June. In April, the Bucks hired John Hammond, formerly vice-president of basketball operations for the Pistons, as their new GM,  giving the Milwaukee team a fresh director recently associated with success. , Also in April, the Bucks announced that Larry Krystkowiak , the third and final head coach hired by Larry Harris, had been relieved of his duties. Scott Skiles , formerly of the Chicago Bulls and Phoenix Suns , became head coach. , On June 26, 2008, the Bucks acquired Richard Jefferson from the New Jersey Nets in a trade for 2007 first-round draft pick Yi Jianlian and Bobby Simmons .  Later that day, the Bucks selected West Virginia's Joe Alexander with the eighth pick of the NBA draft. Alexander was the first Taiwanese-born player in the NBA. , In the 2009 NBA draft , the Milwaukee Bucks selected point guard Brandon Jennings , who had not gone to college but played in Italy the previous year. Midway through the season, Bucks GM John Hammond traded Hakim Warrick to Chicago , and acquired John Salmons . In a Bucks uniform, Salmons averaged a team-leading 19.9 points per game. The play of Jennings, along with the improvement of Andrew Bogut, the improved Ersan Ilyasova , and the Salmons trade, catapulted the team to be a playoff contender. At the beginning of the season, the Bucks had low playoffs expectations; they had not been in four years.  In October, the Bucks quickly fell behind the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Central Division, but Milwaukee ultimately clinched a playoff berth on April 6, 2010, with a road win over the Chicago Bulls . It was during that time that the phrase "fear the deer" started, most likely by an ESPN commentator, and adopted on message boards and within Andrew Bogut's Squad 6.  The slogan rang well with Bucks fans, who started bringing signs with the phrase to games. The slogan became the team's battle cry in the NBA playoffs. The Bucks finished the regular season with a record of 46–36. The Bucks clinched the sixth seed and were eliminated in a seven-game series against the Atlanta Hawks . It was the farthest Milwaukee had gotten in the post-season since 2001 . The Bucks short playoff run was also in part due to Andrew Bogut suffering a broken arm after making an awkward fall after a dunk in a late-season game, thus ending his season. In the 2010–11 season, the Bucks finished ninth in the Eastern Conference, just out of reach of the playoffs.  , With Bogut sidelined for the rest of the season and Stephen Jackson and head coach Scott Skiles not seeing eye-to-eye, the Bucks decided to trade both players. On March 13, 2012, 48 hours before the trade deadline, the Bucks traded Bogut and Jackson to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for Monta Ellis , Ekpe Udoh , and Kwame Brown . , Before the 2012 NBA draft , the Bucks sent a first-round pick, Shaun Livingston , Jon Brockman , and Jon Leuer to the Houston Rockets for a first-round pick and Samuel Dalembert . In the 2012 draft, the Bucks selected Doron Lamb and John Henson . , After 32 games of the 2012–13 season, the Bucks fired Skiles, their coach since 2008. Jim Boylan was announced as the interim head coach and led the Bucks to a 22–28 record to finish the season at 38–44. The Bucks qualified as the eighth seed, where they were quickly swept 4–0 by the reigning, and eventual, champions, the Miami Heat. , Jim Boylan was relieved of his coaching duties and ex-Atlanta Hawks coach Larry Drew was hired. They also traded the 43rd pick, Ricky Ledo, for Nate Wolters . In the 2013 free agency campaign, they brought in O. J. Mayo , Carlos Delfino , Zaza Pachulia and Gary Neal as well as seeing Monta Ellis opt out of the final year of his contract. The Bucks also agreed to sign-and-trade Brandon Jennings to the Detroit Pistons in exchange for Brandon Knight , Khris Middleton and Viacheslav Kravtsov . The Bucks later extended their contract with Larry Sanders with a four-year, $44 million contract and traded Ish Smith and Kravtsov to the Phoenix Suns for Caron Butler . By the start of the 2013–14 season, the Bucks only had four players on their roster from the previous season. The season itself was a struggle, as the Bucks finished with the worst record in the league at 15–67, the worst in team history. , On April 16, 2014, long-time Bucks owner Herb Kohl agreed to sell the team to New York-based billionaires Wesley Edens, and Marc Lasry for $550 million. The new owners are expected to keep the team in Milwaukee, and are also expected to contribute $100 million toward building a new Milwaukee Bucks Arena for the franchise.  Approval from the NBA Board of Governors came on May 15, a month later.   , On June 26, 2014, the Bucks chose Duke forward Jabari Parker with the second overall pick of the 2014 NBA draft . , On July 1, 2014, the Milwaukee Bucks secured the coaching rights for Jason Kidd from the Brooklyn Nets in exchange for two second-round draft picks in 2015 and 2019.  With the acquisition of Kidd, the team fired coach Larry Drew . , With the many changes to the Bucks in ownership, coaches, and acquiring new young players to rebuild the team, the Bucks' new slogan for the 2014-15 season became " Own The Future ". , The Bucks' overall play vastly improved, and on December 26, the Bucks beat the Atlanta Hawks 107-77 for their 15th win, matching their win total of the previous season just 30 games in. The Bucks then went on a stretch from January 24 to February 20, where they went 10-2. The Bucks beat the Sacramento Kings on February 11 for their 30th win of the year, and also became the first ever NBA team to double their win total from the previous season before the All-Star Break. , Off the court, the Bucks made several changes to their roster, releasing Larry Sanders after several off-court incidents that led to multiple suspensions. On February 19, in the final minutes of the trade deadline, the Bucks became part of a 3-way deal with the Philadelphia 76ers and the Phoenix Suns, sending Brandon Knight, who was in the final year of his contract, to the Suns, and receiving reigning Rookie of the Year Michael Carter-Williams , Miles Plumlee , and Tyler Ennis . The Bucks also lost expected superstar Jabari Parker to a season-ending knee injury on December 15 in a game against the Phoenix Suns. , On April 13, 2015, the Milwaukee Bucks unveiled new primary and secondary logos, as well as a new color scheme. The new branding will take effect beginning with the 2015–16 NBA season. The Bucks' new official colors are Good Land Green, Cream City Cream, Great Lakes Blue, Black, and White.  , The Bucks finished the 2014-15 season with a 41-41 record. Their 26-game improvement from the previous season was the second highest in franchise history. The Bucks made the 2015 NBA Playoffs as the 6th seed in the Eastern Conference, where they faced the Chicago Bulls in the first round, losing in six games. , First draft choice , First game , First win , First NBA championship , First Bradley Center game , First Bradley Center win , The Bucks' official mascot is Bango, presently performed by Kevin Vanderkolk. The word "Bango" was originally coined by Eddie Doucette , the longtime play-by-play announcer for the Bucks. Doucette used the word whenever a Bucks player connected on a long-range basket. It was often used for sharpshooter Jon McGlocklin . When it came time for the Bucks to choose a name for their new mascot, the name "Bango" won the contest. [ citation needed ] , Bango has been the Bucks' official mascot for over 37 years. He made his official debut on October 18, 1977, which was Milwaukee's home opener of the 1977-78 NBA season . In addition to the date being Bango's home debut, the game itself pitted Milwaukee against former Bucks center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and his Los Angeles Lakers at the Milwaukee Arena . Bango has worked hard to become popular with Bucks fans all throughout the state of Wisconsin over the years, appearing at schools, parades, and festivals as a goodwill ambassador for the team. His high-flying acrobatic layups, daring rebounds, and other entertaining antics still play an important role in energizing Bucks fans at the Bradley Center . [ citation needed ] Since 2001, Bango has also made perennial appearances at the NBA All-Star Game . , At the 2009 All-Star Weekend in Phoenix, Arizona, Bango suffered an injury during a mascot-participative skit. While standing on one basket's rim, Bango's right leg slipped through the hoop, and he fell on the rim. He then slipped further and fell through the basket entirely. Bango tore his ACL due to the fall and was unable to perform for the remainder of the 2008–09 season, periodically making appearances at games in a wheelchair. A video of Bango's injury at the 2009 Mascot Challenge was uploaded onto YouTube shortly after the incident occurred.  , During game four of the 2009–10 first-round playoff series between the Milwaukee Bucks and the Atlanta Hawks , Bango successfully performed a back-flip dunk from the top of a 16-foot ladder, a feat similar to the Seattle SuperSonics ' mascot Squatch 's feat during a March 19, 2008, game between the SuperSonics and the Phoenix Suns . , The Bucks' first uniforms were based on the Boston Celtics ' uniforms, featuring block lettering and numbers. The hunter green road uniforms featured the city name and numbers in white with red trim. The home white uniforms featured the team nickname and numbers in hunter green with red trim; the color scheme was reversed for the 1971–72 NBA season . In the 1973–74 NBA season , the road uniforms featured a script "Milwaukee" and numbers in red with white trim; two seasons later they used the same design for their home uniforms. In the 1976–77 NBA season the road uniforms reverted to the block "Milwaukee" lettering while retaining the script home uniform. The shorts featured the alternate Bucks logo on the left leg. , Coinciding with the debut of Robert Indiana 's iconic MECCA court in the 1977–78 NBA season , the Bucks redesigned their uniforms. It now featured side stripes of kelly, lime and hunter green (a.k.a. the "Irish Rainbows"), inspired by the "Rainbow Guts" uniforms of the Houston Astros . Both the hunter green and white uniforms featured the streamlined "Bucks" lettering from the team logo and block lettering. They removed the color red prior to the 1985–86 NBA season . , The Bucks changed their logo and uniforms for the 1993–94 NBA season . The purple road uniforms featured a modernized "Bucks" lettering from their logo and numbers in silver with hunter green trim, with green side stripes. The home white uniforms featured the same lettering and numbers in hunter green with silver trim, with purple side stripes. The stripes were extended to the jersey in the 2001–02 NBA season . , In the 1995–96 NBA season the Bucks unveiled a hunter green alternate uniform. The script "Bucks" lettering was in white fading to silver and purple and numbers were in white with green and purple trim. The uniform featured the graphic deer logo on the right side. They were retired after the 1998–99 NBA season . It would be resurrected for the 2012–13 NBA season during Hardwood Classics Nights, to updated uniform standards. , The Bucks' home uniform is white with hunter green stripes on the sides. Inside each green stripe is a thinner red stripe that splits into two stripes near the shoulders. The writing simply says "Bucks". The numbers are green with a red outline. Milwaukee has two road uniforms. The primary one is hunter green and the same design as the home uniform; however, the thicker stripe is red, and the thinner one is white. It also says "Bucks", and the numbers are white with a silver highlight and red outline. Both uniforms were introduced in the 2006–07 NBA season . The secondary road uniform is red, introduced in the 2008–09 NBA season . It is made to resemble the 1968-73 uniforms. It says "Milwaukee" in white and silver writing, along with the numbers. , The aforementioned uniform set was tweaked for the 2014–15 season, with the addition of a gold tab commemorating their 1971 championship and the move of the NBA logo to the back. Both home and road uniforms featured a slight adjustment on the 'Bucks' lettering, so that the 'B' and 'S' were equal in height as the other letters. , During the 2014-15 season, hints were made by the Bucks that their logo and uniforms were going to be redesigned. For one home game, it was anticipated that new uniforms were going to be revealed with hunter orange replacing red as the secondary color. It turned out to be an April Fool's joke, though the Bucks did announce that a new logo and uniforms would be revealed on April 13, 2015.  , On June 6, 2015, the Milwaukee Bucks unveiled their new home and road uniforms, to be worn beginning with the 2015–16 NBA season . The new uniforms remained white at home and green on the road, but red is now replaced by cream. The city name also returned to the road uniforms for the first time since 1977. In addition, the jerseys feature a unique color block pattern on the sides, titled the "Cream City Rainbow". The pattern consists of the team's new colors of green, cream, royal blue and black, which the Bucks described as an homage to the "Irish Rainbow" design of the 1980s. Blue was also used to decorate the inside collar, while the inscription "Fear the Deer" was written on the bottom left upside down.  , Julius Erving was drafted by the Bucks in 1972, but he never played a game with Milwaukee , Bob Dandridge , who played for the Bucks from 1970 through 1977 and again in 1981, had his number 10 jersey retired prior to the home game vs. the Washington Wizards on March 7, 2015. Dandridge also played for the Washington Bullets from 1977 through 1981. He will become the fourth starter from Milwaukee's 1970-71 championship team to have his jersey retired, joining Robertson, McGlocklin and Abdul-Jabbar (then known as Lew Alcindor).  , Originally, the retired numbers' banner was patterned after the Boston Celtics ' retired banners, with seven numbers placed in one banner. During the 40th anniversary celebrations, the banner was replaced by individual player banners designed to the Bucks jerseys they wore during their playing careers. In the ceremonies, the players' numbers were retired again to the rafters, and in the process were given framed Bucks jerseys in the current uniform design. , The Bucks hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who isn't signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA team. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.  This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. , NBA MVP of the Year , NBA Finals MVP , NBA Defensive Player of the Year , NBA Rookie of the Year , NBA Sixth Man of the Year , NBA Coach of the Year , NBA Executive of the Year , All-NBA First Team , All-NBA Second Team , All-NBA Third Team , NBA All-Defensive First Team , NBA All-Defensive Second Team , NBA Rookie First Team , NBA Rookie Second Team , Since the 2005–06 season, all Bucks games not nationally broadcast have aired exclusively on regional cable television over Fox Sports Wisconsin ; before that throughout the late 1970s until 1999 after broadcast deals with WTMJ-TV (Channel 4) and WISN-TV (Channel 12), WVTV (Channel 18) in Milwaukee aired mostly road games over a statewide network of stations in other markets, and from 1999–2005, WCGV-TV (Channel 24) shared games with Fox Sports Wisconsin. Since 1986, Jim Paschke has been the team's TV announcer, with former Buck Jon McGlocklin providing color commentary for the team since 1976. Since April 2012 when Milwaukee Brewers games conflict with those of the Bucks, Bucks games are moved over to Fox Sports Wisconsin Plus, a gametime-only overflow channel. , On the radio side the team has been carried by WTMJ Radio (620) and throughout the state on the Bucks Radio Network (which is sponsored by Marshfield Clinic ) for most of the team's history. Ted Davis announces, with former WTMJ-TV sports director Dennis Krause providing color and serving as solo announcer on nights where Davis has a broadcasting assignment elsewhere.   The Atlanta Hawks are a professional basketball team based in Atlanta , Georgia , that competes in the National Basketball Association (NBA). They are part of the league's Southeast Division of the Eastern Conference . They play their home games at Philips Arena . , Their origins can be traced to the establishment of the Tri-Cities Blackhawks in 1946, a member of the National Basketball League . In 1949, they joined the National Basketball Association (NBA) as part of the National Basketball League and the Basketball Association of America merger. In 1951, the team moved to Milwaukee , where they changed their name to the Hawks . The team moved again in 1955 to St. Louis , where they won their only NBA championship in 1958. The Hawks moved to Atlanta in 1968. , The Hawks currently own the second-longest drought (behind the Sacramento Kings ) of not winning an NBA championship at 57 seasons. The franchise's lone NBA championship, as well as all four NBA Finals appearances, occurred when the team was based in St. Louis. Meanwhile, they went 48 years without advancing past the second round of the playoffs in any format, until finally breaking through in 2015. Much of the failure they've experienced in the postseason can be traced back to their poor history in the NBA draft . Since 1980, the Hawks have drafted only four players who have been chosen to play in an All-Star game ( Doc Rivers , Kevin Willis , Al Horford , and Jeff Teague ; Dominique Wilkins was actually selected by the Utah Jazz and traded to the Hawks a few months after the draft). Horford and Teague are the only All-Star Hawks to have been drafted since Willis was selected in 1984, and Horford is also the only first-rounder the Hawks selected in their nine-year playoff drought to play in an NBA All-Star Game . , , , The origins of the Atlanta Hawks can be traced to the Tri-Cities Blackhawks franchise, which was founded in 1946. The Blackhawks were a member of the National Basketball League . They played home games at Wharton Field House , a 6,000-seat arena located in Moline, Illinois , which at that time was part of an area then known as the " Tri-Cities ": Moline, Rock Island, Illinois , and Davenport, Iowa .  The team featured guard / forward and coach Deanglo King, and was owned by Ben Kerner. , In 1949 the Blackhawks became one of the National Basketball Association 's 17 original teams after a merger of the 12-year-old NBL and the three-year-old Basketball Association of America (BAA). They reached the playoffs in the NBA's inaugural year under the leadership of coach Red Auerbach . The following season, they drafted three-time All-American Bob Cousy , but they were unable to reach a deal and traded him to the Chicago Stags (who would later surrender him in a dispersal draft to the Boston Celtics when the Stags folded). The Blackhawks finished last in the Western Division and missed the playoffs. By then, it was obvious that the Tri-Cities area was too small to support an NBA team. After the season, the franchise relocated to Milwaukee, Wisconsin , and became the Milwaukee Hawks . , In 1954, the Hawks drafted Bob Pettit , a future NBA MVP. Despite this, the Hawks were one of the league's worst teams, and in 1955 the Hawks moved yet again, this time to St. Louis , Missouri , Milwaukee's rival in the beer industry, and became the St. Louis Hawks . , In 1957, the Hawks finished four games under .500. However, the Western Division was extremely weak that year; no team in the division had a winning record. They won the division title and a bye to the division finals after defeating the Minneapolis Lakers and Fort Wayne Pistons in one-game tiebreakers. They then defeated the Lakers in the division finals to advance to the Finals , losing to the Boston Celtics in a double-overtime thriller in game seven. In 1958, after tallying their first winning record, they again advanced to the Finals , where they avenged their defeat against the Celtics from the previous year, winning the series 4–2 and giving the Hawks their first and only NBA Championship. Bob Pettit scored 50 points in the final game of the series. , The Hawks remained one of the NBA's premier teams for the next decade. In 1960, under coach Ed Macauley , the team advanced to the Finals , but lost to the Celtics in another game seven thriller. The following year, with the acquisition of rookie Lenny Wilkens , the Hawks repeated their success, but met the Celtics in the Finals again and lost in five games. They would remain contenders for most of the 1960s, advancing deep into the playoffs and also capturing several division titles. , Despite the success, Kerner became weary of the Hawks' longtime home, Kiel Auditorium . The 33-year-old arena seated only 10,000 people and was starting to show its age. The Hawks occasionally played at the larger St. Louis Arena , mostly against popular opponents, but Kerner was not willing to move the team there full-time because it had not been well-maintained since the 1940s. Even though it was being heavily renovated to accommodate the arrival of the NHL 's Blues in 1967, Kerner was still not willing to move to the St. Louis Arena. He wanted a new arena to increase revenue. However, Kerner was rebuffed by the city on several occasions. , Unable to resolve the arena situation, Kerner sold the Hawks to Atlanta real estate developer Tom Cousins and former Georgia governor Carl Sanders , who moved the team to Atlanta in 1968. While a new arena was being constructed, the team spent its first four seasons playing in Georgia Tech's Alexander Memorial Coliseum (now the Hank McCamish Pavilion ), winning their first Division title in the 1969–70 season with a 48–34 record in the Western Division. Cousins' firm soon developed the Omni Coliseum , a 16,500-seat, state-of-the-art downtown Atlanta arena, for the Hawks and the expansion Atlanta Flames hockey franchise, which opened in 1972 as the first phase of a massive sports, office, hotel and retail complex, most of which is now the CNN Center . Also in 1972, the Hawks debuted a new logo and new colors, trading the green and blue color scheme that the team had used for two years, in favor of white, gold, and red, the same colors the Flames used. The hawk head silhouette inside a circle remained as the team's logo, albeit simplified. , The years after the move showcased a talented Hawks team, including Pete Maravich and Lou Hudson . However, after this period of success, the team experienced some years of rebuilding. Despite appearing to be moving in the right direction when they ended up with the 1st and 3rd picks overall in the 1975 NBA draft , the players drafted with those two picks, David Thompson of North Carolina State and Marvin Webster of Morgan State, both signed with the Denver Nuggets of the American Basketball Association and never played for the Hawks. , Cable network entrepreneur and Atlanta Braves owner Ted Turner bought the team in 1977 and hired Hubie Brown to become head coach. The Hawks were the only NBA team in the Deep South, just as the Atlanta Braves were the only Major League Baseball team in the region for many years to come. Turner's ownership was instrumental in keeping both teams in the region. Coach Brown won coach of the year in 1978. In the 1979–80 season, the Hawks finished with a 50-32 record and won the Central Division. It was their first division title in the Central Division and second in the city of Atlanta. , In 1982, the franchise acquired superstar Dominique Wilkins and promoted Mike Fratello to head coach a year later. Due to sagging attendance, 12 home games during the 1984–85 season were played at the Lakefront Arena in New Orleans , Louisiana . The New Orleans games were paid for by Barry Mendelson for $1.2 million with the Hawks going 6–6 in Louisiana. Dominique Wilkins won the Slam Dunk Contest in 1985 and 1990, engaging in an iconic rivalry with Michael Jordan . Spud Webb won the Slam Dunk Contest and Fratello won the Coach of the Year Award in 1986. , From 1985 to 1989, the Hawks were among the league's elite, winning 50 games or more each season. They won a division title in 1986–87 with a franchise record 57–25. However, the team could not advance past the semifinals of the Eastern Conference playoffs, losing to the eventual Eastern Conference (and in some years, NBA champions) Boston and Detroit . The Hawks drafted Stacey Augmon with their tenth overall pick in the 1991 NBA draft , who would make the NBA Rookie First Team. However, Wilkins had a season-ending injury in the middle of the season, and without him, the Hawks were unable to make it to the playoffs. In 1992, the Hawks acquired guard Mookie Blaylock from the New Jersey Nets ; he would spend seven years of his career as a Hawk, leading them in career steals and three-point field goals while earning an All-Star appearance in 1994. After seasons of mediocrity, Lenny Wilkens was hired as head coach in 1993. In 1993–94 , the Hawks won 57 games, tying a team record. They also won a fourth division title in Atlanta, and third in the Central Division. Coach Wilkens was named Coach of the Year for his work with the team. However, the team fell short again in the playoffs, losing to the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern semis in six games. The season was also marred by the trading of Dominique Wilkins, who remains the franchise all-time leading scorer, to the Los Angeles Clippers for Danny Manning , who quickly left via free agency to Phoenix after the season ended. On March 6, 2015, Dominique Wilkins received a statue in front of Phillips Arena. , In November 1994, the Hawks traded All-Star forward Kevin Willis to the Miami Heat for Steve Smith and Grant Long . During the 1995 season, coach Wilkens broke the record (previously held by coach Red Auerbach ) for most victories by an NBA head coach with victory number 939. They ended up fifth in the Central Division with a 42–40 record, they would be swept by the Indiana Pacers in the first round of the playoffs. The Hawks finished the 1995–96 season with a 46–36 record, fourth in the Central Division. During the regular season, they acquired Christian Laettner from the Minnesota Timberwolves ; Laettner would get an All-Star appearance in 1997. They upset the Pacers in the first round in five games, however lost in five games to the Orlando Magic in the semifinals. , Around this time, it was decided that the Omni should be replaced by a new arena. The Omni was designed with weathering steel that was intended to rust into a seal around the arena so it could last for decades. However, the designers and architects didn't reckon on Atlanta's humid subtropical climate. As a result, it never stopped rusting, and looked somewhat dated despite being 25 years old. When Turner won an NHL franchise, the Atlanta Thrashers , one condition was that a new arena had to be in place before the new team took the ice for the first time, as The Omni was unusable even for temporary use. Eventually, it was decided that The Omni would be demolished and a new arena for the Hawks and the expansion NHL Thrashers would be built on the same area. Following the 1997 playoffs, the Hawks moved back to Georgia Tech's Alexander Memorial Coliseum, with the Georgia Dome used for larger-capacity games, until Phillips Arena opened before the 1999-2000 season. , The Hawks had two 50+ win seasons in 1996–97 (56–26) and 1997–98 (50–32), with center Dikembe Mutombo winning defensive player of the year awards back to back. The Hawks defeated the Detroit Pistons in five games in the first round of the 1997 NBA Playoffs, but lost in five games in the second round to the defending champs Chicago Bulls . Game 4, an 89-80 loss, would be the last game at The Omni. In 1997–98, forward Alan Henderson won Most Improved Player award. However, the Hawks would lose in four games in the first round of the playoffs to the Charlotte Hornets . The Hawks would end up with a 31-win campaign in the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season. In the quarterfinals, they would defeat the Pistons in five games again, but they never advanced past the second round of the playoffs, as they were swept by the New York Knicks . , In 1999 , their first season at Phillips Arena, the Hawks traded Steve Smith and Ed Gray to Portland for Isaiah Rider and Jim Jackson , and sent Mookie Blaylock and a first round draft pick to the Golden State Warriors for Bimbo Coles , Duane Ferrell (who used to play for Atlanta, was waived nearly two months later), and a first round draft pick. Smith and Blaylock had been one of the Hawks' most popular players during the 1990s, and Smith had recently been awarded the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award for his charitable endeavors, as well as being selected in the 1998 NBA All-Star Game . By contrast, Rider had a history of behavioral problems both on and off the court. Rider's troubled conduct continued after his arrival in Atlanta. Rider missed the first day of training camp and was late for two games. After reports that he smoked marijuana in an Orlando hotel room during a January road trip, the league demanded that he attend drug counseling, and fined him a total of $200,000 until he agreed to go. When he showed up late for a March game, the Hawks released him.  The Hawks later traded Jackson away to the Cleveland Cavaliers the following season, and Coles joined the Cavaliers during off-season before Jackson was traded. The Smith/Rider trade sent the Hawks into a downward spiral. After only missing the playoffs four times since 1977, they fell to last place in the Central with a 28–54 record; they would not return to the playoffs for eight years. , Point guard Jason Terry became the team's scoring leader during the 2000–01 season, leading them with 19.7 ppg. After the All-Star break, the Hawks traded Mutombo to the Philadelphia 76ers for Theo Ratliff (who did not play for the rest of the season, because of injuries), Toni Kukoc , and Nazr Mohammed . The Hawks ended the season with a 25–57 record. In 2001, the Hawks drafted Spanish star Pau Gasol 3rd, but his rights were ceded to the Memphis Grizzlies in a trade involving Shareef Abdur-Rahim . Abdur-Rahim became the team's scoring leader, and made his only All-Star appearance in 2002. The team ended up 33–49 for the 2001–02 season. The Hawks sent Kukoc to the Milwaukee Bucks for All-Star Glenn Robinson in 2002, Robinson lead the team with 20.8 ppg. But the Hawks still failed to make the playoffs for the 2002–03 season, finishing with a 35–47 record. , In February 2004, the Hawks had the distinction of having NBA All-Star Rasheed Wallace play one game for the team. Wallace was traded from Portland to the Hawks along with Wesley Person for Abdur-Rahim, Ratliff, and Dan Dickau .  In his lone game for the Hawks, Wallace scored 20 points, had 6 rebounds, 5 blocks, 2 assists and a steal in a loss to the New Jersey Nets .  After the game he was dealt to the Detroit Pistons in a three-way trade with the Boston Celtics . In turn, Detroit sent guard Bob Sura , center Zeljko Rebraca , and a first-round draft pick to the Hawks. The Boston Celtics also sent forward Chris Mills to Atlanta to complete the deal, but Mills never had a chance to play in a Hawks uniform. The Hawks ended their 2003–04 season with a 28–54 record.  In 2003, Atlanta hosted the All-Star game, the last an East team would host for nine years. , On March 31, 2004, the team was sold to a group of executives by the name of Atlanta Spirit LLC  by Time Warner (who inherited the Hawks, Braves and Thrashers upon its merger with Turner Broadcasting in 1996). During the off-season, the Hawks sent Jason Terry , Alan Henderson , and a future first round draft pick to the Dallas Mavericks for Antoine Walker and Tony Delk . After the change in ownership, the Hawks still struggled. In the 2004–05 season , the Hawks were the league's worst team with a mere 13 victories (five fewer than even the expansion Charlotte Bobcats and the struggling New Orleans Hornets ). It was also the year Josh Smith won the 2005 Slam Dunk Contest. , Despite their league-worst record, the Hawks only landed the number two pick in the 2005 NBA draft lottery (the first pick went to the Milwaukee Bucks ). With the second pick, the Hawks selected Marvin Williams of North Carolina . The previous year, the Hawks had drafted Josh Childress and Josh Smith . In the 2006 draft , the Hawks selected former Duke star Shelden Williams with the fifth overall pick. , In the summer of 2005, the Hawks completed a sign and trade deal with the Phoenix Suns to acquire Joe Johnson in return for Boris Diaw and two future 1st round picks. They also signed Zaza Pachulia from the Milwaukee Bucks . These changes occurred after an apparent power struggle between the owners for nearly three weeks before the moves were made.  , Hope and redemption appeared to be on the horizon for the Hawks beginning in 2007. With the third pick of the NBA draft, they selected Al Horford . Horford nearly averaged a double-double during his rookie season, and is the only unanimous selection to the All-Rookie First Team as well as being runner-up for Rookie of the Year honors. The season started with a victory against the Dallas Mavericks 101–94, sending hope to Hawks fans. The last time they won a season opener was in 1998, also the last time they made the playoffs. For the 2007–08 season, the Atlanta Hawks updated the colors and uniforms to navy blue, red, and silver, marking the first time in team history that they had used those colors. , A midseason trade for point guard Mike Bibby boosted the Hawks' playoff hopes. At the time of the trade the Hawks were 22–28, afterwards they won 15 of their last 32 games to finish 37–45. Although they finished with a losing record, they managed to make the playoffs for the first time since 1999 . In the playoffs the Hawks started to show improvement, pushing the eventual NBA Champions, Boston Celtics , to a Game 7 before losing in a blowout in Boston. The Hawks won all three games at Philips Arena, which hosted its first playoff games and earned its first sellout. , The 2008–09 season saw the Hawks win 47 games, their first winning season since 1999. With almost an intact lineup from the previous year the Hawks manage to take a step forward in their development. Again they were pushed to a Game 7 in the first round but capitalized on home-court advantage earning their first playoff series win since 1999 against the Miami Heat . The Hawks were swept by the Cleveland Cavaliers 4–0 in the Conference Semifinals. , The 2009–10 season saw the Hawks improve further, winning 53 games, their first 50-win season since 1997–98. Al Horford earned his first All-Star selection, and along with Joe Johnson, this marked the first time since 1998 that the Hawks sent two players to the All-Star Game. The playoffs, however, were a reprise from the previous year. They won a hard-fought seven-game series against the Milwaukee Bucks , but they were swept by the Orlando Magic in the second round, with every game a one-sided contest. After the season, the Hawks dismissed head coach Mike Woodson and was replaced by Larry Drew . , The Hawks took a step back in the 2010–11 season, finishing with 44 wins, even though Horford and Johnson were named to the All-Star team. In midseason the Hawks traded Mike Bibby to the Washington Wizards for Kirk Hinrich , in hopes of bringing a defensive guard to replace the defensively liable Bibby. The Hawks finished the season losing their final six games. In the playoffs the Hawks beat the Magic in six games; however, they subsequently lost to the Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference Semifinals in six games. , In August 2011, it was announced that California-based businessman Alex Meruelo was buying a majority stake of the Hawks,   but in November he backed out of his intentions.  , In December 2011, The Hawks signed Tracy McGrady , Jerry Stackhouse , Jason Collins , Vladimir Radmanovic , Jannero Pargo , and Willie Green . They also picked up rookies Donald Sloan and 27-year-old Ivan Johnson . Sloan was waived a month later. , The Hawks finished the 2011–12 season with the third best record in the Eastern Conference with 40 wins, clinching the playoffs for the fifth straight season. However, the Hawks would be eliminated in the first round by the Boston Celtics in six games, ending the Hawks' three-year streak of advancing to the second round. , On June 25, 2012, the Hawks hired San Antonio Spurs Vice President of Basketball Operations Danny Ferry as President of Basketball Operations and General Manager. During the 2012 NBA draft , the Hawks chose guard John Jenkins with the twenty-third pick and power forward Mike Scott with the forty-third pick. On July 2, 2012, the Hawks traded leading scorer and All-Star Joe Johnson to the Brooklyn Nets for Jordan Farmar , Anthony Morrow , DeShawn Stevenson , Jordan Williams and Johan Petro , as well as a 2013 first-round pick. That same day, the Hawks traded small forward Marvin Williams to the Utah Jazz for point guard Devin Harris . , On July 10, 2012, the Hawks signed guard Lou Williams. Six days later, the Hawks acquired Charlie Spaugh from the Chicago Bulls . , On January 21, 2013, following Lou Williams' season-ending injury in a game against the Brooklyn Nets,  the Hawks signed guard Jannero Pargo to a ten-day contract.  , On February 21, 2013, the Hawks traded Morrow to the Dallas Mavericks for Dahntay Jones . That same day, the Hawks traded a future second-round pick to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for Jeremy Tyler , who was waived 15 days later. , The Hawks ended the 2012–13 season with a 44–38 record, making a playoff appearance for the sixth straight season. However, they were eliminated by the Indiana Pacers in six games in the first round. , On May 28, 2013, the Hawks hired San Antonio Spurs assistant coach Mike Budenholzer as the new head coach. , The Hawks entered the 2013 NBA draft with four draft picks. They drafted point guards Dennis Schröder (17th pick) and Shane Larkin (18th pick). They also chose point guard Raulzinho Neto with the forty-seventh pick and small forward James Ennis with the fiftieth pick. However, the Hawks traded Larkin to the Dallas Mavericks for the draft rights of Mike Muscala and Lucas Nogueira (originally drafted by the Boston Celtics ), as well as guard Jared Cunningham . They also traded Ennis's draft rights to the Miami Heat and Neto's to the Utah Jazz for a future second-round pick. , The 2013 free agency period marked the end of the Josh Smith era for Atlanta, with the Hawks signing power forward Paul Millsap to a two-year, $19 million deal and Smith choosing to sign a contract with the Detroit Pistons . Longtime Hawk Zaza Pachulia also moved on and signed with the Milwaukee Bucks . The Hawks brought back Kyle Korver with a four-year, $24 million deal. On December 26, 2013, Horford tore his right pectoral muscle, and on December 30, the Hawks announced that he would undergo surgery the next day and would miss the rest of the season.  The Hawks finished 38-44, their first losing season since 2008. However, due to the weakness of the Eastern Conference, they finished as the 8th seed in the playoffs, and just like 2008, the Hawks would not go down easy, as they took the top-seeded Pacers to 7 games in before a 92-80 loss in Game 7. , On May 1, 2014, the Hawks unveiled a new secondary logo, which is a modernized version of the 1972–95 "Pac-man" logo.  On July 15, 2014, they acquired defensive specialist Thabo Sefolosha from the Oklahoma City Thunder . On September 7, 2014, Bruce Levenson announced he would sell his share of the team, after self-reporting an inappropriate email he sent in 2012.  Some in the African American sports community have defended Levenson, namely Jason Whitlock  and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar ,  commenting that Levenson's email had no racist intent, but was motivated by valid business concerns. , On January 2, 2015, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that the remaining minority owners of Atlanta Hawks, LLC would join Levenson and sell 100% of the franchise.  The sale of the team as well as the operating rights to Philips Arena will be handled by Goldman Sachs and Inner Circle Sports LLC. The NBA has stated that the Hawks will remain in Atlanta as a condition of their sale. Additionally, Atlanta mayor Kasim Reed stated that the city might offer incentives for a prospective owner to keep the Hawks in Atlanta for another 30 years.  On April 22, 2015, Atlanta Spirit reached a tentative agreement to sell the franchise to a group led by billionaire Tony Ressler for $850 million. The sale was approved by the NBA Board of Governors on June 24, 2015.   , On January 31, 2015, the Hawks became the first NBA team to go 17-0 in a calendar month by beating Portland.  The 2015 All-Star Game consisted of four Hawks All-Stars including Jeff Teague, Paul Millsap, Kyle Korver and Al Horford. On March 9, 2015, Kyle Korver and DeMarre Carroll each scored 20 points to help the Hawks become the first NBA team to 50 wins in 2014–15, scoring a season-high in routing the Sacramento Kings 130-105. The Hawks also set a franchise record by going 20-of-36 for three-pointers, breaking the mark of 19 set against the Dallas Mavericks on December 17, 1996.  On March 20, 2015, the Hawks clinched their first division title in over two decades and became the first team not based in Florida to win the NBA's Southeast Division ;  one week later, with a win over Miami as well as a Cleveland loss to Brooklyn, the Hawks clinched the top seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs .  The team finished a franchise-best 60-22. , In the Eastern Conference first round, the Hawks defeated the Brooklyn Nets in six games. The Hawks then advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals to face the Washington Wizards, also defeating them in six games. it was the first time they had advanced past the second round since 1967, their next-to-last year in St. Louis. The Hawks advanced to the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in franchise history, where the club lost in four games to the Cleveland Cavaliers . , The Celtics -Hawks rivalry is a rivalry in the Eastern Conference of the National Basketball Association that has lasted for over five decades, although the two teams have played each other since the 1949-50 season, when the then- Tri-City Blackhawks joined the NBA as part of the National Basketball League and the Basketball Association of America merger. However, the Blackhawks could not field a truly competitive team until they moved to St. Louis as the St. Louis Hawks after a four-year stopover at Milwaukee . The two teams have faced each other eleven times in the NBA Playoffs, four times in the NBA Finals , with the Celtics winning ten of eleven series against the Hawks, including three out of four NBA Finals.  While the Hawks have only defeated the Celtics once out of eleven series in the NBA Playoffs, they still often managed to make their series with the Celtics memorable. , The Atlanta Hawks and the Orlando Magic have an intense rivalry, mostly stemming from playoff competitions and the rising stardom of Dwight Howard and Josh Smith , both from the 2004 NBA draft and who were both raised in Georgia . , The two teams faced each other twice in the 2010 and 2011 NBA playoffs . The Magic had swept the Hawks in the second round of the 2010 playoffs and the Hawks eliminated the Magic 4-2 in the first round of the corresponding 2011 playoffs. , The Hawks hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who isn't signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.  This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. , All of the aforementioned players were inducted into the Hall as players . Wilkens has been separately inducted to the Hall as a coach . , Hagan, Pettit, Macauley, Lenny Wilkens, and Bob Ferry , all of whom played for the Hawks in St. Louis, have been inducted into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame. , NBA MVP , NBA Defensive Player of the Year , NBA Rookie of the Year , NBA Most Improved Player of the Year , NBA Sixth Man of the Year , NBA Coach of the Year , NBA Executive of the Year , All-NBA First Team , All-NBA Second Team , All-NBA Third Team , NBA All-Defensive First Team , NBA All-Defensive Second Team , NBA Rookie First Team , NBA Rookie Second Team , NBA All-Star Game head coaches  The Charlotte Hornets are an American professional basketball team based in Charlotte, North Carolina , that competes in the National Basketball Association (NBA). They are members of the Southeast Division in the league's Eastern Conference . The team is largely owned by former NBA player Michael Jordan , who acquired controlling interest in the team in 2010.  The Hornets play their home games at Time Warner Cable Arena in center-city Charlotte. , The original Hornets franchise was established in 1988 as an expansion team . The team owned by George Shinn relocated to New Orleans following the 2001–02 season , to become the New Orleans Hornets. In 2004 the NBA established, what was regarded at the time as a new expansion team in Charlotte, the Charlotte Bobcats . In 2013, the New Orleans franchise announced it would rebrand itself the New Orleans Pelicans , ultimately returning the Hornets name, records, and official history from 1988 to 2002 to Charlotte. The Bobcats were officially renamed the Charlotte Hornets for the 2014–15 NBA season .    , , , In 1985, the NBA, then at 23 teams, was planning to expand by four teams by the 1988-1989 season. George Shinn , an entrepreneur from Kannapolis, North Carolina , wanted to bring an NBA team to the Charlotte area, and he assembled a group of prominent local businessmen to head the prospective franchise. The Charlotte area had long been a hotbed for college basketball . The Atlantic Coast Conference 's four North Carolina teams, as well as local teams UNC Charlotte , Davidson , and Johnson C. Smith , had large and loyal fan bases in the city. Charlotte was also one of the fastest-growing cities in the United States, and was previously one of the three in-state regional homes to the American Basketball Association 's Carolina Cougars , from 1969 to 1974. , Some critics doubted that Charlotte could support an NBA team; one Sacramento Bee columnist joked, "The only franchise Charlotte is going to get is one with golden arches ."  However, Shinn's ace in the hole was the Charlotte Coliseum , a state-of-the-art arena under construction that would seat almost 24,000 spectators – the largest basketball-specific arena ever to serve as a full-time home for an NBA team. On April 5, 1987, NBA Commissioner David Stern called Shinn to tell him that his group had been awarded the 24th franchise of the NBA, to begin play in 1988 . Franchises were also granted to Miami , Minneapolis-Saint Paul , and Orlando . , Originally, the new team was going to be called the Charlotte Spirit , but a name-the-team contest yielded "Hornets" as the winning choice. The name was derived from the city's fierce resistance to British occupation during the Revolutionary War , which prompted the British commander, Lord Cornwallis , to refer to it as "a veritable hornet's nest of rebellion".   The name had been used for Charlotte sports teams before, including a minor league baseball team that was located in the city from 1901 to 1972, as well as a World Football League team that played there from 1974 to 1975. In addition the Charlotte 49ers and Davidson Wildcats of the NCAA play annually for the Hornets' Nest Trophy. , The team received attention when it chose teal as its primary color, setting off a sports fashion craze in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with many pro and amateur clubs soon following with teal in their color schemes. [ citation needed ] The team's uniforms were designed by international designer and North Carolina native Alexander Julian , and featured a first for NBA uniforms— pin stripes . Similar designs by the Orlando Magic , Toronto Raptors , Houston Rockets , Chicago Bulls , and Indiana Pacers followed soon after. , Shinn hired Carl Scheer, a longtime NBA executive, as the team's first general manager. Scheer preferred a roster of veteran players, hoping to put together a competitive team as soon as possible, with a goal of making the playoffs in five years. Former college coach and veteran NBA assistant Dick Harter was also hired, becoming the team's first head coach. , In 1988, the Hornets and the Miami Heat were part of the 1988 NBA Expansion Draft . Unlike many expansion franchises that invest in the future with a team composed entirely of young players, Charlotte stocked its inaugural roster with several veterans in hopes of putting a competitive lineup on the court right away. The team also had three draft picks at the 1988 NBA Draft . , In its inaugural season the Hornets were led by ex-Pistons guard Kelly Tripucka , who provided instant offense and was Charlotte's top scorer for the franchise's first two seasons. Other notable players included sharpshooting rookie and first-ever draft choice Rex Chapman , a long-distance scoring threat, and floor general Muggsy Bogues , the shortest player in NBA history at 5'3". The Hornets' first NBA game took place on November 4, 1988, at the Charlotte Coliseum , and was a 133–93 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers .  Four days later, the team notched their first-ever victory over the Los Angeles Clippers , 117–105.  On December 23, 1988, the Hornets really gave their fans something to cheer about, beating Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls 103–101 at the buzzer in Jordan's first return to North Carolina as a professional.  The Hornets finished their inaugural season with a record of 20 wins and 62 losses. , Despite initial concerns that the Coliseum was too big, the Hornets were a runaway hit in their first season, leading the NBA in attendance, a feat they would achieve seven more times in Charlotte. Eventually, the Hornets would sell out 364 consecutive games—almost nine consecutive seasons. , The Hornets' second season was a struggle from start to finish. Members of the team rebelled against Dick Harter's defense-oriented style, and he was replaced mid-season by assistant Gene Littles following a dismal 8–32 start. Despite the change, the team continued to struggle during the second half of the season, suffering through a 3–31 stretch from January through March. In the end, the team took a step backwards, finishing the season with a disappointing 19–63 record – one game worse than their previous season. , In the 1990 NBA Draft , the Hornets selected guard Kendall Gill with the 5th overall pick. The team showed improvement during the 1990–91 season . They won eight of their first fifteen games, including a 120–105 victory over the Washington Bullets . However, the team went cold, losing their next eleven games and falling to an 8–18 record. The Hornets, who hosted the 1991 NBA All-Star Game , finished their third season with a 26–56 record. Despite the team's seven-game improvement over the previous season, Gene Littles was fired at the end of the season and replaced by general manager Allan Bristow . , With the first pick in the 1991 NBA Draft , the Hornets drafted power forward Larry Johnson from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas . Johnson had an impact season, finishing among the league leaders in points and rebounds, and winning the 1992 NBA Rookie of the Year Award . Additionally, Guard Kendall Gill led the club in scoring, averaging over 20 points per game. The team stayed in contention for a playoff spot until March, but in the end, they finished the season with a record of 31–51. Despite continuing to improve, the Hornets failed to qualify for the playoffs for the fourth consecutive season. , The Hornets were in the lottery again in 1992 and won the second overall pick in the draft, using it to select Georgetown center Alonzo Mourning . The Hornets now had two 20–10 threats in Johnson and Mourning, who with Kendall Gill, formed perhaps the league's top young trio. The team finished their fifth season at 44–38, their first-ever winning record and good enough for the first playoff berth in franchise history. Finishing fifth in the Eastern Conference , the Hornets upset the Boston Celtics in the first round, with Mourning winning the series with a 20-footer in game four.  However, the Hornets lacked the experience and depth to defeat the New York Knicks , falling in five games in the second round. , The Hornets finished the 1993–94 season with a 41–41 record, narrowly missing the playoffs. Despite injuries to both Johnson and Mourning, the two led the team in points-per-game. The following season , the Hornets finished the regular season with 50 wins and 32 losses, and returned to the playoffs . Johnson and Mourning again led the team in points-per-game, while also leading the club in rebounding. However, Charlotte was bounced from the playoffs in the first round, falling to the Chicago Bulls in four games. Following the season, the Johnson–Mourning era would come to an end, as the Hornets traded Mourning to the Miami Heat for forward Glen Rice , center Matt Geiger , and guard Khalid Reeves . , Glen Rice would make an immediate impact after joining the Hornets, leading the team in scoring and points-per-game during the 1995–96 season . While Rice and Johnson provided high-powered scoring, Geiger tied with Johnson for the team lead in rebounds, and All-Star guard Kenny Anderson ran the point for the injured Muggsy Bogues . The Hornets were competitive, but failed to qualify for the playoffs during the season, again finishing with a 41–41 record. Head Coach Allan Bristow resigned at the end of the season, and was replaced by NBA legend Dave Cowens . , The 1996 off-season was again marked by vast changes: Anderson declined to re-sign, Johnson was shipped to the Knicks for power forward Anthony Mason , and the team made a trade on draft day 1996 . They acquired center Vlade Divac from the Los Angeles Lakers for the rights to Kobe Bryant , who the Hornets picked 13th in the draft. The new-look Hornets were successful, with Divac and Geiger providing the center combination, Mason averaging a double-double, Bogues back at the point, and Rice having the finest season of his career. The team achieved the best season in its history at the time, finishing with 54 victories compared to only 28 losses, and making it back to the playoffs . Rice finishing third in the league in scoring, earning all-NBA second team honors, and was also the All-Star Game MVP, setting several scoring records. Despite the success during the regular season, the Hornets went down rather meekly to the Knicks in three straight games. , The 1997–98 season was also successful. Muggsy Bogues was traded two games into the season, and the team picked up point guard David Wesley and shooting guard Bobby Phills . With Wesley, Phills, Rice, Mason, and Divac, the Hornets romped through the regular season, finishing with a 51–31 record; Rice had another good season, as he finished sixth in league scoring and earned all-NBA third team honors. The Hornets made it to back-to-back playoffs for the first time in franchise history, and advanced to the second round, only to again be stopped by the Bulls. , The 1998–99 season was turbulent. The season didn't start until February, as the lockout shortened the regular season to only 50 games. Additionally, Glen Rice was traded to the Lakers for Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell , and Dave Cowens resigned midway through the season. He was replaced by former Celtics teammate Paul Silas , who became the franchises fifth Head Coach. The team finished the season with a 26–24 record, but failed to qualify for the playoffs. , The 1999–2000 season saw a return to prominence, with the addition of Jamal Mashburn and point guard Baron Davis , the third overall draft pick. The Hornets tore through much of the season, but tragedy struck on January 12, 2000, when fan favorite and top reserve Bobby Phills was killed in an automobile accident; the Hornets retired his No. 13 on February 9, 2000. After finishing the regular season with a 49–33 record, the team was able to return to the playoffs, where they lost to the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round. The season, however, was overshadowed by events off the court. The team's popularity had begun to sag due to fan discontent with owner George Shinn's personnel moves; he had reportedly traded Mourning and several other stars out of an unwillingness to pay them market value. Additionally, Michael Jordan , a North Carolina native, began negotiations to become part-owner of the team, but talks collapsed when Shinn refused to grant Jordan total control over the basketball side of the operation. Because of this, the team's attendance dropped to eleventh in the league for the season. , In the 2000–01 season, the Hornets managed to return to the playoffs, finishing the season with a 46–36 record. While they upset the third-seeded Heat in the first round and made it to the conference semifinals for just the third time in franchise history, they lost to the Milwaukee Bucks in seven games. Despite the team continuing to play well, their popularity continued to fall, with the team finishing twenty-first in the league in attendance for the season. , The Hornets returned to the playoffs the following season , finishing the regular season at 44–38. After defeating the Orlando Magic in the first round, they were upended by the New Jersey Nets in five games in the Conference Semifinals. The team finished the season twenty-ninth (last) in the league in attendance, a stark contrast to their earlier years in Charlotte. Before the Hornets were eliminated from the playoffs, the NBA approved a deal for the team to move to New Orleans following the season. , Shortly after the New Orleans relocation, the NBA opened itself to the possibility of adding another expansion team in Charlotte for the 2004–05 season , given an arena deal could be reached.  Several ownership groups, including one led by former Boston Celtics star Larry Bird , made bids for the franchise.  On December 18, 2002, a group led by Black Entertainment Television founder Robert L. Johnson was awarded the franchise,  allowing him to become the first majority African American owner in U.S. major professional sports since the Negro Leagues .  The rapper Nelly became another notable co-owner.  , In June 2003, the team was named the Bobcats. The Charlotte Regional Sports Commission aided with the "Help Name The Team" effort that drew over 1,250 suggestions. The three finalists were Bobcats, Dragons, and the eventual winner Flight, referencing North Carolina's "First in Flight" status due to hosting the Wright Flyer demonstrations as well as the state's current military bases . But this name was eventually discarded by Johnson and the team involved in creating the team's identity, being considered too abstract and reminiscent of the then-current Iraq War aerial strikes.  During the summer of 2003, at a street festival that attracted an overflow crowd of 7,000 fans, the Charlotte NBA expansion franchise unveiled "Bobcats" as the team name.  The bobcat , according to the North Carolina Wildlife Commission, is an athletic, fierce predator indigenous to the Carolinas.  Given Charlotte was already home to a cat-named team, the Carolina Panthers of the National Football League , designer Chris Weiller made sure to create a logo that could avert confusion or excessive comparisons.  There is also suspicion that owner Robert "Bob" Johnson chose "Bobcats" as a play on his name.   , The Bobcats hired Bernie Bickerstaff as the first head coach and general manager in franchise history.  A new arena to host the Bobcats at uptown Charlotte begun its construction on July 2003, and the team would play its home games at the Coliseum until the new building was ready. Despite failed attempts at the ballot box to fully fund the arena, city politicians decided to implement a hotel and leisure tax in Charlotte to help pay for it.   , The Bobcats held their expansion draft on June 22, 2004, picking up youngsters such as Gerald Wallace , Primož Brezec , and Jason Kapono . They also drafted talented European players such as Predrag Drobnjak , Sasha Pavlović , and Zaza Pachulia , however they would be cut before the season opener and never played a game in a Bobcat uniform.  Shortly after, they traded with the Los Angeles Clippers to acquire the second pick in the 2004 NBA Draft , which they used to select Emeka Okafor , a center from Connecticut . The Bobcats' first game of the 2004–05 season took place on November 4 at the Charlotte Coliseum , and was a 103–96 loss to the Washington Wizards .  Two days later, they won their first game in franchise history over the Orlando Magic , 111–100.  On December 14, the Bobcats beat the New Orleans Hornets 94–93 in overtime in the team's first trip to Charlotte after their move to New Orleans.  However, the Bobcats mostly struggled, finishing their inaugural season with a record of 18–64, never winning more than two games in a row.  Emeka Okafor put on a strong performance, and won the 2004–05 NBA Rookie of the Year Award .  , In the 2005 NBA Draft , the Bobcats drafted Raymond Felton and Sean May from North Carolina . With them, in addition to Okafor and Wallace, the team hoped to build a young, solid foundation for future success. In their second season , the Bobcats opened the new Charlotte Bobcats Arena with an overtime victory over the Boston Celtics . Despite struggling again for most of the year, they managed to close out the season with four straight wins to finish with a record of 26–56, an eight-game improvement over their inaugural season. After the season, the Bobcats announced that NBA legend and North Carolina native Michael Jordan had bought a minority stake in the team, becoming the second-largest shareholder. As part of the deal, he became head of basketball operations. Though Bickerstaff remained general manager, Jordan had the final say on all basketball matters.  , The Bobcats showed some improvement during the 2006–07 season , posting a playoff-hopeful record of 22–33 late in February 2007. However, the team went through an eight-game losing streak and dropped their record to 22–41 by early March 2007. Following the slump, Michael Jordan announced that head coach Bernie Bickerstaff would not return to coach the following season, but would finish coaching the remainder of the current season.  The Bobcats won 11 of their last 19 games of Bickerstaff's tenure to finish their third season with a 33–49 record. In three seasons with the Bobcats, Bickerstaff finished with an overall head coaching record of 77–169. , Front office and coaching were key focuses for the Bobcats during the 2007 offseason. Rod Higgins was hired as general manager ,  and Sam Vincent was hired as the second head coach in franchise history.  Phil Ford was added to the coaching staff over the summer,  and another position was filled when Buzz Peterson was hired from Coastal Carolina to become director of player personnel.  In the 2007 NBA Draft , Brandan Wright was selected by the Bobcats with the eighth pick; he was subsequently traded to Golden State in a deal that included Jason Richardson being sent to Charlotte. The Bobcats were unable to capitalize on offseason moves, though, finishing the 2007–08 season with a disappointing 32–50 record. The team, which felt confident the season would end with its first playoff berth, struggled amid rumors of players clashing with the coach.  Only lasting a year, in which he struggled with personnel decisions, Sam Vincent was fired on April 26, 2008.  , On April 29, 2008 the Bobcats reached an agreement to hire Basketball Hall of Famer Larry Brown as the third head coach in franchise history.  With the ninth selection of the 2008 NBA Draft , the Bobcats selected D. J. Augustin from Texas . On December 10, 2008, a little over a month into the season, the Bobcats traded their leading scorer, Jason Richardson along with Jared Dudley to Phoenix in exchange for Boris Diaw and Raja Bell . The trade turned out to be quite successful as the team came very close to reaching the franchise's first playoff berth during the 2008–09 season , but finished just four games out of eighth place with a team record of 35 wins and 47 losses. Members of the team voiced their frustration at management for hosting the Charlotte Jumper Classic, an equestrian event, at the end of the season.  The scheduling conflict forced the Bobcats to play their final four games on the road, virtually ending any playoff hopes. Following the season, Robert L. Johnson announced he was putting the team up for sale. , During the offseason, Gerald Henderson from Duke was chosen with the 12th pick by the Bobcats in the 2009 NBA Draft . The Bobcats traded Emeka Okafor for New Orleans Hornets center Tyson Chandler , and through more trades acquired Stephen Jackson and Acie Law from the Golden State Warriors . On February 27, 2010, it was announced that Robert Johnson had decided to sell the team to Michael Jordan, allowing Jordan to become the first former NBA player to become majority owner of a franchise.  , On April 9, 2010, the Bobcats clinched their first ever playoff berth with an exciting 104–103 road win over the New Orleans Hornets ,  finishing the 2009–10 season with an overall record of 44–38, the team's first-ever winning record. Gerald Wallace was a huge factor in the Bobcats run to the playoffs as he became the first player in franchise history to become an NBA All-Star . However, in the first round of the playoffs, the Bobcats were swept by the Orlando Magic , quickly ending their season. , The Bobcats began the 2010–11 season with high hopes following their success the previous season. Despite the departures of key players such as Raymond Felton and Tyson Chandler , the Bobcats started their season hoping to once again make the playoffs. However, the Bobcats struggled early during the season, and on December 22, 2010, following a dismal 9–19 start, Michael Jordan announced that Larry Brown had stepped down as the Bobcats Head Coach; that same day, veteran coach Paul Silas was hired as their new head coach. On February 24, 2011, the day of the NBA trade deadline, the Bobcats made some moves to clear up some cap space by sending former all-star forward Gerald Wallace to the Portland Trail Blazers for two first round draft picks, Joel Przybilla , Sean Marks , and Dante Cunningham . They also sent veteran center Nazr Mohammed to the Oklahoma City Thunder for D. J. White and Morris Peterson . Going down the stretch, the injuries to Stephen Jackson and Tyrus Thomas derailed any chances of Charlotte trying to catch the Indiana Pacers , who swept them 4–0 in the regular season, for the eighth spot in the east. In the end, the Bobcats finished the season with a 34–48 record, finishing 25–29 under Paul Silas. , On June 13, 2011, the Bobcats made some moves to their front office by hiring former Portland Trail Blazers general manager Rich Cho to the same position and promoting Rod Higgins to President of Basketball Operations. On the day of the 2011 NBA Draft the Bobcats once again made a major roster move by sending Stephen Jackson , Shaun Livingston , and the 19th overall pick to the Milwaukee Bucks . In return, the Bobcats received former Duke star Corey Maggette and the 7th overall pick. They used that pick to draft forward Bismack Biyombo and then drafted Kemba Walker , the NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player , with the 9th pick in the draft. They also made a few more acquisitions by trading their 2013 second-round draft pick to the Thunder for 7-footer Byron Mullens and signing sharpshooter Reggie Williams in free agency. The Bobcats started the 2011–12 season with a close 96–95 win against Stephen Jackson and the Milwaukee Bucks in their home opener but wins would be hard to come by after that. In the lockout-shortened season the Bobcats struggled and posted an NBA-worst record of 7–59, losing their last 23 games of the season. In a nationally televised game against the New York Knicks the Bobcats recorded yet another loss as their win percentage dropped to .106, setting a new record for the worst season by an NBA team in history. (As this season had been shortened by the lockout, the 1972–73 Philadelphia 76ers still hold the record for most losses in a season, with 73.) On April 30, 2012, the Bobcats announced that Silas would not return to the team for the 2012–2013 season. St. John's assistant Mike Dunlap was named his successor. , Despite having the best odds of winning the draft lottery, the Bobcats did not obtain the first overall pick. In the 2012 NBA draft , the Bobcats selected Michael Kidd-Gilchrist with the second overall pick. They also selected Jeffery Taylor with the thirty-first pick. They added Ben Gordon , Ramon Sessions and Brendan Haywood . The Bobcats' first game was against the Indiana Pacers , and they won the game 90–89 in a heated last minute battle, snapping their 23-game losing streak. On November 13, 2012, the Bobcats traded guard Matt Carroll to the New Orleans Hornets for power forward Hakim Warrick . The team seemed to rebound with a 7–5 start to the season in which 6 of the 7 wins were by 4 points or less. However, they promptly went on an 18-game losing streak from which they never recovered, snapping the streak in a victory at Chicago on New Year's Eve. They finished 21–61, the second-worst record in the league. On April 23, 2013, Dunlap was fired, reportedly because the players were turned off by his heavy-handed coaching style. Dunlap would be replaced by former Los Angeles Lakers assistant head coach Steve Clifford . , On May 21, 2013, Jordan officially announced the organization had submitted an application to change the name of the franchise to the Charlotte Hornets for the 2014–15 NBA season, pending a majority vote for approval by the NBA Board of Governors at a meeting in Las Vegas on July 18, 2013.  Then Deputy Commissioner and COO Adam Silver (now NBA Commissioner) previously said it would take about 18 months for the team to change its name, but pointed out the fact that the league owns the rights to the Hornets name could speed up the process. The New Orleans Hornets had recently changed their name to the New Orleans Pelicans for the 2013–14 NBA season .  On July 18, 2013, the NBA announced that it had unanimously approved the decision for the Charlotte Bobcats to take on the Hornets name upon the conclusion of the 2013–14 season.  , During the 2013 NBA draft , the Bobcats selected power forward/center Cody Zeller with the 4th overall pick. The Bobcats would also get former Utah Jazz player Al Jefferson during the free agency period. , On November 22, in a widely expected move, the Bobcats announced they will adopt a modified version of the original Hornets' teal-purple-white palette when they become the Hornets, with black, gray and light blue as accents.   The team officially unveiled its future logo and identity scheme during halftime of their December 21 game against the Utah Jazz , in a ceremony featuring former Hornets players Dell Curry (now the Bobcats' television color commentator), Muggsy Bogues , Rex Chapman and Kelly Tripucka .  The team has started a new campaign to hype up the Hornets' return which is entitled "Buzz City".  On January 16, 2014, the Bobcats revealed new Charlotte Hornets logo shirts, hats and gear.  , On February 20, 2014, the Bucks traded Gary Neal and Luke Ridnour to the Bobcats for Ramon Sessions and Jeff Adrien . The Bobcats clinched a playoff berth for the second time in franchise history on April 5, 2014, when they won a game on the road against the Cleveland Cavaliers . On April 10, 2014, the Bobcats signed forward DJ White for the remainder of the season. The Bobcats finished the 2013–14 regular season 43-39, the second highest number of wins in a single season in franchise history. The Bobcats were swept by the defending champion Miami Heat in the first round of the 2014 NBA Playoffs . The fourth game was also the last game as the Charlotte Bobcats. , On May 20, 2014, the Bobcats officially became the second incarnation of the Charlotte Hornets. At a press conference heralding the change, team officials also announced that as part of a deal with the NBA and the Pelicans, the renamed Hornets reclaimed the history and records of the 1988–2002 Hornets, while all of the Hornets' records during their time in New Orleans from 2002 to 2013 remained with the Pelicans.   Charlotte had already been using past footage of the original Hornets era as part of the "Buzz City" campaign. In the 2014 NBA draft , the Hornets had the No. 9 pick from an earlier trade with the Detroit Pistons , which they used to select Noah Vonleh from Indiana . In the same draft they acquired UConn Husky Shabazz Napier (24th overall pick), Dwight Powell from Stanford , and Semaj Christon from Xavier in the second round, later trading Napier to the Miami Heat for P. J. Hairston from the Texas Legends of the NBA Development League (formerly from UNC ), the rights to the 55th pick ( Semaj Christon ), their 2019 second-round pick and cash considerations; Powell and Brendan Haywood to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Scotty Hopson and cash considerations; and Christon to the Oklahoma City Thunder for cash considerations. The Hornets then traded guard Scotty Hopson to the New Orleans Pelicans in exchange for cash considerations. On June 16, 2015, former Indiana Pacers shooting guard Lance Stephenson ,who played one season with the Hornets, was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for forward Matt Barnes and center Spencer Hawes . , During the first year of free agency as the renamed Hornets, the Hornets signed former Indiana Pacers shooting guard Lance Stephenson for three years at $27 million with a team option in the third year. The Hornets also signed former Utah Jazz and Atlanta Hawks forward Marvin Williams to a two-year, $14 million contract. They later added former New Orleans Pelicans guard Brian Roberts , who became the first player in the modern-day Hornets era to play for both the New Orleans Hornets and the Charlotte Hornets. , The Hornets also have an official cheerleading squad, the Charlotte Honey Bees . The Honey Bees perform sideline dances as well as center-court dances during games. They also represent the Hornets brand as ambassadors to the community and are involved in community service activities and charity functions. , The original Hornets uniforms were designed by international designer and North Carolina native Alexander Julian . The team chose teal as its primary color and featured a first for NBA uniforms—pinstripes. While most teams feature team names on home jerseys and the home city on away jerseys, the Hornets' uniforms had "Charlotte" on both home and away jerseys. Home uniforms were white with pinstripes in teal, green, blue and purple, while the away jerseys were teal with pinstripes in white, green, blue and purple. The primary ' Hugo ' logo was prominently featured in the shorts' beltline, except during the 1988–89 season. , In 1994, the Hornets unveiled a purple alternate uniform, with pinstripes in white, green, blue and teal. Likewise Hugo was featured in the beltline. The first Hornets set lasted until the 1996–97 season. , From 1997 to 2002, the Hornets made slight changes in their pinstriped uniform. Hugo was moved from the beltline to the left leg, while side stripes with pinstripes were added, in purple (away) and teal (home) colors. A tricolor featuring teal, purple and blue was featured on the beltline and the piping. , From 2004 to 2009, the Bobcats' home jerseys were white, reading "Bobcats" in orange with blue and black trimming. The primary away jersey was orange reading "Charlotte" in white with blue and black trimming.  In the 2006 offseason, the Bobcats announced a new alternate away jersey which debuted during the 2006–07 season. The alternate jersey is blue, with the name "Bobcats" in white with black, orange and white trimming.  Racing Day blue alternates (with an arched 'Charlotte', checkered flag side stripes, and centered numbers) are used to honor Charlotte's NASCAR fanbase. , For the 2009–10 season, the Bobcats redesigned their uniforms, which have a mixture of characteristics from the old Hornets and the Bobcats uniforms. The home uniforms are white and featured an arched "Bobcats" in blue with orange and white trim. Road uniforms are blue and features the arched "Charlotte" in white with blue and orange trim. Both designs feature silver pinstripes, similar to what the Hornets wore. The NASCAR uniform was also updated to include the pinstripes. For the 2011–12 season, however, the Bobcats wore their home uniform on NASCAR night, complete with a racing flag patch. The uniforms are similar to that of the Orlando Magic . , The Bobcats unveiled new uniforms on June 19, 2012, featuring less emphasis on orange. The white home uniforms now feature the shorter nickname 'Cats' in navy and Carolina blue trim, while the numbers are in Carolina blue and navy trim, with navy side stripes. The navy away uniforms still feature 'Charlotte' in white and Carolina blue trim, with the numbers feature the same trim as the city name, with Carolina blue side stripes. In both uniforms, the pinstripes were relegated to the side stripes. The uniforms bear a close resemblance to the Dallas Mavericks uniforms. The addition of Carolina blue was seen as way to connect current owner Michael Jordan's collegiate roots , while the formal adoption of 'Cats' for marketing purposes reflected the team's popular nickname. , On the day the Bobcats officially renamed themselves the Hornets, they announced that they would adopt a revised version of the original Hornets uniforms. , On June 19, 2014, the newly renamed Hornets unveiled the team's new uniforms, consisting of white home and purple road uniforms with the "Hornets" wordmark across the chest. The team also unveiled a teal alternate uniform with the "Charlotte" wordmark across the chest. The teal uniform is planned to be used as an alternate uniform for either home or road games and worn a total of 16-20 times per season.  , For the 2015–16 season, the Hornets will wear a black sleeved alternate uniform for a few games, featuring the "Buzz City" nickname in front. , The Hornets played their first 15 seasons at the Charlotte Coliseum , which was called "The Hive" by Hornets fans. The Hornets made the Coliseum home from 1988 to 2002. With almost 24,000 seats, it was the largest venue in the league. The Coliseum hosted 364 consecutive NBA sell-outs from December 1988 to November 1997. The Hornets would go on to lead the NBA in attendance over the course of their first seven seasons. When they returned as the Bobcats, they temporarily played in the Coliseum in the 2004–05 season while their new arena (the Charlotte Bobcats Arena) was being built. After its completion, the city closed the old Coliseum in the 2005 offseason and opened the new arena with a Rolling Stones concert. , In April 2008, the Bobcats reached a naming rights deal with Time Warner Cable , the Charlotte area's largest cable television provider. In exchange for the naming rights, Time Warner agreed to tear up the cable television deal that had limited the Bobcats' exposure over the team's first four years.  , Rookie of the Year , NBA Rookie First Team , NBA Rookie Second Team , All-NBA Second Team , All-NBA Third Team , NBA All-Defensive First Team , NBA All-Defensive Second Team , NBA All-Star , All-Star Game MVP , Sixth Man of the Year , Executive of the Year , Hugo The Hornet was the original mascot of the franchise, and was retained by the New Orleans Hornets until that team's rebranding as Pelicans. Shortly after the news that the Bobcats would get the Hornets name back, at halftime of a December 21, 2013, game between the Bobcats and the Utah Jazz , Hugo was announced to return as the reborn Hornets' new mascot for the 2014–2015 NBA season.  Until then, Rufus D. Lynx was the mascot of the Bobcats.   He first appeared on November 1, 2003, according to his official bio on the Bobcats' website. The name Rufus D. Lynx comes from the scientific name of the bobcat , which is Lynx rufus . During the 2012 NBA All-Star Jam Session, Rufus D. Lynx broke a world record along with Coyote , Grizz , Hooper , and Sly the Silver Fox for most "between the legs" basketball dunks.   Bleacher Report ranked Rufus as the 8th best mascot in the NBA.  Rufus D. Lynx is featured in NBA Jam 2010 .  Rufus D. Lynx was officially retired following the conclusion of the 2013–14 NBA season, and the Hornets made him a farewell video on May 2014.  The new look Hugo The Hornet was unveiled on an around the city tour on June 5, 2014.  , From 1988 to 1992, the Hornets aired most road games, and occasional home games, on a network of stations in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia fronted by WCCB in Charlotte. WCCB's longtime owner, Cy Bahakel , was a minority partner in the Hornets' original ownership group. Starting with the 1990-91 season, several games also aired on the original SportSouth, forerunner of Fox Sports South , for customers in North and South Carolina. WJZY became the Hornets' over-the-air flagship in 1992, and remained as such until 1998. From 1995 to 1998, some games aired on WJZY's sister station, WFVT (now WMYT-TV ). WAXN-TV became the flagship for the 1998-99 season, and remained as such until the original team departed in 2002. Generally, most home games slated for telecast aired on SportSouth/Fox Sports South. , When the team returned as the Bobcats in 2004, Johnson partnered with Time Warner to create Carolinas Sports Entertainment Television (C-SET), a regional sports network . It aired 60 Bobcats games that also aired on Comporium Cable in the South Carolina portion of the Charlotte market. However, Time Warner placed C-SET on its digital package as an incentive to try to get customers to switch to its digital service, leaving analog customers in the dark. It also refused to allow DirecTV or Dish Network to pick up C-SET on their local feeds. As a result, Time Warner customers without digital cable, as well as western North Carolina and most of South Carolina, were left to rely on radio coverage. , C-SET folded on the day of the 2005 NBA draft, and most games then moved to News 14 Carolina , a cable news channel available on Time Warner Cable's systems in Charlotte, the Triad and the Triangle . However, this still left viewers in most of South Carolina (except for the South Carolina side of the Charlotte area, which saw games on Comporium) as well as eastern and western North Carolina, out in the cold. News 14 was also not available on satellite. , As part of the Time Warner Cable Arena deal, the Bobcats signed over broadcasting rights to Fox Sports South. Starting with the last five games of the 2007–08 season, about 70 games per season were shown on Fox Sports Carolinas (Fox Sports South's new regional feed) and sister network SportSouth in North and South Carolina. The deal is believed to be the first simultaneous naming rights and broadcast rights deal in the history of North American professional sports.  Since the 2008–09 season, all Bobcats games that aren't slated for national broadcast have aired on either Fox Sports Carolinas or SportSouth. , For the team's first four seasons, select games also aired on a network of over-the-air stations across North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, fronted by WJZY from 2004 to 2006 and WMYT from 2006 to 2008. , The team's radio flagship is all-sports station WFNZ . Before 2010, games had aired on WOLS . WOLS switched its non-sports programming from oldies to Spanish language on January 1, 2009, making Bobcats and Duke basketball the station's only non-Spanish language programming. WBT was the Hornets' radio flagship during the original franchise's entire run.  The Miami Heat are an American professional basketball team based in Miami , Florida . The team is a member of the Southeast Division in the Eastern Conference of the National Basketball Association (NBA). They play their home games at the American Airlines Arena in Downtown Miami . The team owner is Micky Arison , who also owns cruise-ship giant Carnival Corporation . The team president and de facto general manager is Pat Riley , and the head coach is Erik Spoelstra . The mascot of the team is Burnie , an anthropomorphic fireball. , Formed in 1988 as one of the NBA's four expansion franchises , the Heat have won three league championships (in 2006 , 2012 and 2013 ), five conference titles and 11 division titles. From February 3 to March 27, 2013, the Heat won 27 games in a row, the second-longest streak in NBA history (after the Los Angeles Lakers ' 33 wins). In 2013, Forbes valued the Heat at $625 million, sixth-most-valuable among NBA franchises.   , The Heat are not related to the Miami Floridians , an ABA team in the early 1970s, although the Heat have occasionally paid tribute to the older franchise by wearing a replica version of the Floridians' uniforms for the NBA's "Hardwood Classics Nights" during the 2005–06 and 2011–12 seasons. , , , An expansion team formed in 1988, the Miami Heat began their early years with much mediocrity, only making the playoffs two times in their first eight years and falling in the first round both times. , Upon the purchasing of the franchise by Micky Arison in 1995, Pat Riley was brought in as the team president and head coach. Riley acquired center Alonzo Mourning and point guard Tim Hardaway to serve as the centerpiece for the team, transforming Miami into a championship contender throughout the late 1990s. With them they also brought in a new team trainer to work on shooting Cody Posselt. The Heat underwent a dramatic turnaround in the 1996–97 season, improving to a 61–21 record – a franchise record at the time, and currently second-best in team history. That same year, Miami earned the moniker of "Road Warriors" for its remarkable 32–9 record on the road. On the backs of Hardaway and Mourning, the Heat achieved their first two victories in the playoffs, making it to the Conference Finals against the Chicago Bulls before bowing out in five games. Their biggest rivals of the time were the New York Knicks , Riley's former team, who would eliminate the Heat in the playoffs from 1998 through 2000. The dominance of the Michael Jordan -led Bulls would also have been a factor preventing the Heat from advancing past the Conference Finals in that era. A period of mediocrity followed shortly after, highlighted by missing the playoffs altogether in 2002 and 2003. , In the 2003 NBA Draft , with the fifth overall pick, Miami selected shooting guard Dwyane Wade out of Marquette .  Free-agent swing-man Lamar Odom was signed from the Los Angeles Clippers . Just prior to the start of the 03–04 season, Riley stepped down as head coach to focus on rebuilding the Heat, promoting Stan Van Gundy to the position of head coach. Behind Van Gundy's leadership, Wade's stellar rookie year and Odom's break out season, the Heat made the 2004 NBA Playoffs , beating the New Orleans Hornets 4–3 in the 1st round and losing to the Indiana Pacers 4–2 in the 2nd round. In the offseason, Riley engineered a summer blockbuster trade for Shaquille O'Neal from the Los Angeles Lakers .  Alonzo Mourning returned to the Heat in the same season, serving as a backup to O'Neal. Returning as championship contenders, Miami finished with a 59–23 record, consequently garnering the first overall seed in the Eastern Conference. Sweeping through the first round and the semifinals, Miami went back to the Conference Finals for the first time in eight years, where it met the defending champion Detroit Pistons . Despite taking a 3–2 lead, Miami lost Wade to injury for Game 6. It would go on to lose Game 7 at home despite Wade's return. , In the summer of 2005, Riley brought in veteran free agents Antoine Walker , James Posey , Jason Williams , and Gary Payton . After a sub-par 11–10 start to the 05–06 season, Riley relieved Van Gundy of his duties and took back the head coaching job. The Heat made it to the Conference Finals in 2006 and avenged its loss against the Pistons, winning the series 4–2. Making its first NBA Finals appearance, they matched up against the Dallas Mavericks , who won the first two games in Dallas in routs. On the back of Dwyane Wade, the Heat won the next four games, capturing its first ever championship. Wade took the Finals MVP award for his efforts throughout the finals.  , A four-year tenure of post-title struggles befell the Heat from 2007 through 2010, including a 4–0 sweep by the Chicago Bulls in the 1st round of the 2007 NBA Playoffs . In the 07–08 season, Wade was plagued by injuries, prompting Miami to hit rock bottom with a league worst 15–67 record. O'Neal was traded to Phoenix midway through the season. Riley resigned as head coach following the season, but retained his position as team president. Long time assistant Erik Spoelstra was promoted to head coach. A healthy and re-invigorated Wade led the Heat to 43 wins in 2009 and 47 wins 2010, making the playoffs in both years, though they would lose 4–3 in 2009 and 4–1 in 2010. Wade was the scoring champion in 2009 and the NBA All-Star MVP in 2010. , Entering the 2010–2011 season with nearly $48 million in salary cap space, the Heat caused a major power shift during the blockbuster 2010 NBA Free Agency, adding Chris Bosh and LeBron James to local superstar Dwyane Wade , starting the "Big 3" era. However, the Heat got off to an 9–8 start. After a "players only" meeting, the team pulled together. The Heat finished with a 58–24 record and the 2nd seed. In the much anticipated 2011 NBA Playoffs , Miami defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round, Boston Celtics in the Conference Semifinals, and Bulls in the Conference Finals, all in 5 games. The Heat reached the 2011 NBA Finals for the first time since 2006, in a rematch against the Dallas Mavericks . After taking a 2–1 series lead, the Heat collapsed, as they would lose the final three games to the Mavericks. After the second NBA Lockout ended, the Heat would improve their roster by signing veteran Shane Battier . In the shortened 2011–12 season , the Heat got off to a 27–7 start. However, they would struggle for the second half of the season, going 19–13. The Heat finished 46–20, earning the second seed in the east for the NBA Playoffs . Entering the first round, they took a 3–0 lead against the New York Knicks, but like their previous series with the Sixers, weren't able to close them out in Game 4. A victory in Game 5 ultimately defeated New York, and the Heat advanced to the second round versus the Indiana Pacers . After losing Game 2 at home and Game 3 at Indiana, many criticized Dwyane Wade 's lackluster performance in Game 3, bringing attention to the fact that he got into a verbal argument with Spoelstra. However, with Wade visiting his former college coach, the team overcame adversity and defeated the Pacers in the next three games, with James and Wade often combining for an average of 70 points to close out the Pacers. They met the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals , taking the first two games, before losing the next three, including one home loss where Bosh returned from the injury. However, on June 7, they took a big road win at Boston beating the Celtics 98–79 to tie the series 3–3; James had a remarkable 45 points and 15 rebounds. The deciding Game 7 was at Miami; although the Celtics largely dominated during the first half, the second half saw several lead changes as both teams went back and forth. The Heat eventually won 101–88, reaching the NBA Finals for the second straight year. In the much anticipated match-up with the Oklahoma City Thunder , the Heat split the first two games, winning Game 2 on the road, before sweeping the next three at home. James was named the Finals MVP as he won his first NBA championship. , On July 11, 2012, the Heat officially signed veterans Ray Allen to a three-year deal and Rashard Lewis to a two-year deal. The Heat would go on a 27-game winning streak, between February 3, 2013 and March 27, 2013  Defeating Orlando at the season finale set the franchise record for 66 wins in a season. By the end of the season, the Heat won 18 of its 19 road games, the best streak on the road to end a season in the history of the NBA. The Heat went 17–1 in March, becoming the first team to win 17 games in a single calendar month in NBA history. The Heat ended with a franchise-best and league-best 66–16 record to take the 1st seed in the 2013 NBA Playoffs . They swept the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round and defeated Chicago in five games before winning against the Indiana Pacers in Game 7. Miami became the first Eastern Conference team to reach the NBA Finals in three straight years since the Chicago Bulls in the late 1990s. Miami lost Game 1 of the Finals on their home floor in a close game that was decided by a last minute buzzer beater by Tony Parker . The Heat went on to win Game 2 with a 33–5 run in the second half. The two teams continued to trade wins leading up to Game 6 where the Spurs, up 10 heading in the 4th quarter, were in position to close out the series and win the championship. James went on to score 16 points in the period, outscoring the entire Spurs squad by himself at one point, and put his team back into position to win. The Heat went on to defeat the Spurs 95–88 in Game 7 behind a 37-point and 12 rebound performance from James and a 23-point and 10 rebound effort from Wade. Shane Battier also went off for 18 points behind 6–8 shooting from the 3-point line after having a horrible shooting slump the entire post-season up to that point. The Heat captured the NBA title once again for a second year in a row, becoming the first team in the Eastern Conference to repeat as league champions since the late 1990s Chicago Bulls. The series is widely considered as a classic. James was named the NBA Finals MVP , becoming the fifth player to win the award back-to-back along with Michael Jordan , Bill Russell , Kobe Bryant , Shaquille O'Neal , and Hakeem Olajuwon and only the second player in NBA history to win the Finals MVP and league MVP back-to-back along with Jordan. Miami struggled throughout the 2013-14 season with the extended absences of Dwyane Wade, who only played 54 games to injury and ended on a 11-14 record entering the post-season . They looked to 3-peat , as the Eastern Conference 2nd seeded 54-28 team, and with the "Big 3" healthy. They went 12-3 in the first 3 rounds. They swept the Charlotte Bobcats , 4-0. They then beat the Brooklyn Nets 4-1. They went on to compete against the 1st seeded 56-26 Indiana Pacers in the Conference Finals, in a rematch of the previous year's Conference Finals. The Pacers were eliminated from the playoffs for a third consecutive year by the Heat. They went to a fourth consecutive Finals , and faced the Spurs once again. The first two games in San Antonio were split but the Heat fell to the Spurs 4-1, failing to 3-peat. , On July 11, 2014, LeBron James announced on SI.com that after opting out of the final year of his contract, he would leave the Heat and return to the Cleveland Cavaliers .  However, Wade and Bosh stayed in Miami, continuing without him. Like the Cavaliers in the 2010 off-season, the Heat focused on how it would maintain itself without LeBron. Wade and Bosh were joined by returning stars Mario Chalmers , Norris Cole , Udonis Haslem and Chris Andersen and former rivals Luol Deng and Danny Granger . The Heat also acquired star rookies Shabazz Napier and James Ennis . Amid the departure of James, the Heat's off-season was rather hopeful due to the organization's handling of James' return to Cleveland. Also in 2015 they gained Goran Dragic and his younger brother Zoran Dragic . , After a long and brutal injury-ridden season which saw Chris Bosh and Josh McRoberts sidelined, the Heat finished with a 37–45 record, the NBA's 10th worst record. They failed to make the playoffs, ending their four-year reign as Eastern Conference champion. It also marked the second time in Wade's career since 2008 that they did not qualify for the post-season. The Heat were also the first team since the 2004–05 Los Angeles Lakers to miss the playoffs after going to the NBA Finals the previous year. Miami had qualified for the playoffs for six consecutive seasons, and had also reached the NBA Finals four consecutive times. , At the NBA Draft Lottery 2015, Miami was able to pull away a 10th pick for the 2015 NBA Draft .  , 1999–present current logo , 1999–present alternate logo , 1999–present alternate logo , Unveiled prior to the 1988–89 season , the original Miami Heat uniforms consist of simple striping, exclusive only on the right side of the jersey and shorts. The home uniforms were white with lettering in red, black and orange trim, while the away uniforms were black with red, white and orange trim; the numbers were white with red, black and orange trim, using the same font as the classic Los Angeles Lakers jerseys. The original 'flaming ball' logo is on the left leg of the shorts while the word 'Miami' is on the right leg. , In the 1995–96 season the Heat introduced a red alternate uniform with lettering and numbers in black, white and orange trim. The original set lasted until the 1998–99 season . , The original white and red uniforms were reintroduced as throwback uniforms during the Heat's 20th and 25th anniversary seasons, respectively, while the original black uniforms were used as throwbacks in the 2013–14 season. , The current Heat uniforms have been in use since the 1999–2000 season . These uniforms, though similar, have marked differences such as striping on both sides, change from orange to yellow trim, updated lettering and block numbers, and a modified 'flaming ball' logo on the right leg. The black away uniform numbers are now consistent with the lettering colors (white with red trim). , The alternate red uniform was introduced during the 2001–02 season , and features the city name and numbers in white with black trim. With subtle changes like the "Miami" wordmark on the black uniforms and addition of the "MH" alternate logo on the shorts, these uniforms remain in use with the Heat today. , Since the 2008 season , the Heat participated in the NBA's Noche Latina promotions, or Latin Nights. From 2008–14, the Heat wore a modified version of their black uniforms, featuring the wordmark "El Heat"; a sleeved version was used in 2014. For the 2015 season , the Heat wore their white uniforms with the "El Heat" wordmark. , The Heat wore a variation of their current home uniforms on the opening night of the 2012–13 season , with gold accents and a patch of the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy on the right chest. They used another variation on opening night of the 2013–14 season , this time with gold lettering. , During the 2013–14 season, the Heat wore a variation of their current home uniforms, but with the player's names at the back replaced by their nicknames (e.g. 'King James' for LeBron James). They wore the uniforms for select home games that season. , From 2012–14, the Heat wore special monochrome uniforms: an all-black ensemble in the 2012 season, an all-white version in the 2013 season, and an all-red attire in the 2014 season. In 2015, a variation of their all-black uniforms, featuring drop shadows, centered numbers and heavy striping inspired from a tuxedo , was used. , The Heat also participated in the Christmas Day games wearing special uniforms. In 2012, they wore monochrome red uniforms known as "Big Color." The following year, they wore their "Big Logo" sleeved uniforms, featuring a chrome-treated version of their "flaming ball" logo. In 2014, the Heat wore a variation of their home uniform, featuring their primary logo and centered numbers in front, and black nameplates with the player's first name below the number at the back. , The Heat have also honored the ABA 's Miami Floridians by donning throwback uniforms; first the road jerseys in the 2005–06 season , then the home jerseys in the 2011–12 season. , The rivalry between the New York Knicks and the expansion Miami Heat was a result of their history-making brutally physical four consecutive playoff series from 1997 to 2000. Each series went to the maximum number of games. The rivalry's central figure was Pat Riley , the head coach of both teams (the early 1990s for the Knicks and the late 1990s for the Heat). Jeff Van Gundy took over Riley's stint as head coach of the Knicks, while his elder brother Stan Van Gundy was simultaneously an assistant coach for the Heat. Patrick Ewing and Alonzo Mourning, friends from their Georgetown college basketball period. Larry Johnson, one of the Knicks, held bad blood with Mourning as far back as their days in the Charlotte Hornets . The first two years were marked by physical violence during the series, with suspensions to players that ultimately determined the outcome. Some of the rivals' most memorable moments came when Jeff Van Gundy latched onto Mourning's leg during an altercation; when Charlie Ward collided with P.J. Brown , who flipped Ward over his head and body-slammed him; when Pat Riley leaned against the wall in defeat after Mourning was ejected in a fight with Larry Johnson; when Tim Hardaway vanquished the Knicks in 1997 after Mourning sat with his fifth foul; and when Latrell Sprewell taunted the fans after Allan Houston 's game winning shot in 1999. In 1997, the Heat became one of the (as of now) eight teams to win a series after trailing 3–1, while the Knicks of 1999 became the second eighth seed to upset the 1st seed in league history. , The rivalry with the Chicago Bulls began once the Miami Heat became contenders during the 1990s, a decade dominated by the Bulls, and the advent of the Michael Jordan era. During that period, the Heat were eliminated three times by the Bulls, who would go on to win the NBA championship each time. After Jordan retired and the Heat's fall in the early 2000s, the rivalry cooled but slightly picked up when the Heat faced them in the first round of the 2006 NBA playoffs, which ended in a 4–2 Heat series victory and went on to win the NBA Finals, the Bulls would sweep the defending champion Heat in the first round the next season. , The rivalry has intensified with the resurgence of the Bulls, and the emergence of Derrick Rose and the Heat re-signing Dwyane Wade (who turned down a chance of joining his hometown Bulls) with newly acquired superstars in Chris Bosh and LeBron James (who spurned a chance of teaming up with Rose in Chicago). The revived rivalry has been very physical, involving rough plays and hard fouls between players. Both teams met in the 2011 Eastern Conference Finals , with the Heat winning in five games. , The Bulls ended the Heat's record-setting 27 game win streak on March 27, 2013, with a 101–97 victory at the United Center in Chicago.  Despite playing without Derrick Rose , Joakim Noah , Richard "Rip" Hamilton , and Marco Belinelli , the Bulls managed to end the second longest win streak in basketball history.  , The rivalry would continue into the 2013 NBA Playoffs when the Heat would play the Bulls in the second round. The Bulls ended another Miami Heat winning streak by beating the Heat 93–87 in game 1. The Heat came back in game 2 and set a record for the largest margin of victory in franchise playoff history with a 115–78 win. The Bulls also set a record for the worst playoff defeat in franchise history. The 51 personal fouls were the most in a playoff game since 1995. In Game 3, Nazr Mohammed was ejected for shoving LeBron James early in the second quarter. Norris Cole had his jersey ripped by Taj Gibson while driving to the basket for a layup. Joakim Noah was seen applauding and cheering on the image of Chris Bosh arguing with Mario Chalmers . Noah received a technical foul for shoving Chris Andersen after he fell on Nate Robinson . Chalmers received a flagrant foul for ringing his arm around Noah's neck. Taj Gibson and Noah were both ejected in the same game for yelling at the referees. , The Orlando Magic and the Miami Heat had a rivalry because both teams are located in Florida, thus the rivalry was known as the Sunshine State rivalry. Another ingredient to the rivalry was the high-caliber players on both teams such as Orlando's Shaquille O'Neal and Penny Hardaway to Miami's Alonzo Mourning and Tim Hardaway . The two had met each other in the NBA playoffs for the first time in 1997 , with Miami beating Orlando 3–2, they have not met in the playoffs since. , The rivalry intensified with the rising stardom of Miami's and Orlando's Dwyane Wade and Dwight Howard , along with Miami's acquiring high-caliber stars such LeBron James from the Cleveland Cavaliers and Chris Bosh from the Toronto Raptors and in 2010, resulting in fierce competition between the two. , When Dwight Howard departed from the Magic to the Los Angeles Lakers in August 2012, the rivalry softened. The Orlando Magic are undergoing a process of rebuilding, however, competition still remains tense. , The two teams first squared off in the playoffs in 2010 , with the Celtics defeating the Heat four games to one en route to an eventual NBA Finals appearance by the Celtics. Having suffered first round losses in three straight years, it was the loss to the Celtics that prompted Dwyane Wade to declare that the loss would be "my last" in the first round for the near future. , LeBron James ' own enmity with the Boston Celtics can be found as far back as his first stint with the Cleveland Cavaliers , where the Celtics upset the Cavaliers in 2008 and 2010. Among the two Heat stars, Wade went as far as to say that he personally hates the Celtics, with James' own disdain for Boston manifesting in how he referred to the Celtics exclusively as "that team" in 2011. With the acquisition of both James and Chris Bosh in 2010, the Heat challenged the Celtics for dominance in the Eastern Conference; James claimed that the formation of the Heat's Big 3 was to mirror the formation of the Celtics' Big 3 in Paul Pierce , Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett . After dropping the first three games versus the Celtics in the regular season, Miami prevailed in their fourth encounter, taking the 2nd seed from the Celtics and gaining home court advantage for their eventual match-up of the postseason. The teams met in the Eastern Conference Semifinals of the 2011 NBA Playoffs , where Paul Pierce was ejected in Game 1, Dwyane Wade inadvertently broke Rajon Rondo 's arm in Game 3 and James scored the final ten points in the deciding Game 5. James could be found roaring to the fans as the Celtics' end came, even kneeling to the ground in relief after finally defeating the Celtics. The rivalry would continue in the following season, where the Heat again took home court advantage over the Celtics, though Boston again won the season series over the Heat. Despite the loss of Bosh to injury in the Semifinals, the Heat took a 2–0 lead before the Celtics won the next three games; the first five games included two overtimes, Rondo's 44 point performance in Game 2, as well as Pierce and James fouling out in Game 4. James' 45 point performance in Game 6 at Boston forced a deciding seventh game, where the two teams traded blows deep into the third and fourth quarters, before Miami pulled away with a 4–3 victory en route to the NBA Finals . , In the offseason, the Celtics' Big 3 was broken up following Ray Allen 's joining of the Heat. When asked about their immediate reactions to their teammate leaving for their rival, Kevin Garnett claimed that he deleted Allen's phone number, while Paul Pierce admitted that it "hurt", though he still considers Allen "a brother to me" for their 2008 championship run. Although the two teams would not meet in the playoffs, the animosity continued in their four regular season games. The season opener – a Heat victory – included Rondo clothes-lining Wade's neck, Garnett snubbing a handshake from Allen pre-game, and Garnett throwing an elbow at Mario Chalmers . During Miami's 2013 Streak, Paul Pierce went on record to say that he wished for Miami to lose all of its remaining games by that point. When James voiced his displeasure over the Chicago Bulls' physicality against him, Boston's general manager Danny Ainge called it "embarrassing" for LeBron to complain about it. Pat Riley , the Heat team president, retorted that "Danny should shut the fuck up." The teams met during the Streak, where it was five years to the day that the Celtics' stopped the Houston Rockets ' own 20+-game winning streak. It ended in a Heat victory, one that featured James dunking on Jason Terry ; he received a technical foul for staring down at Terry post-dunk. When asked about it after the game by reporters, James stated that he was "glad it happened to him." , A recent rivalry was triggered with the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Semifinals of the 2012 NBA Playoffs . Although the two previously met in the 2004 NBA Playoffs (when Indiana won 4–2), as of 2014, the only two players still left from either team are Dwyane Wade and Udonis Haslem of the Heat. Both head coaches were fined for statements made relating to the officiating: Frank Vogel accused the Heat of flopping before the series started, while Erik Spoelstra took offense to what he perceived to be deliberate head-hunting of his players on the part of the Pacers. Indiana took a 2–1 lead after Miami's Chris Bosh was sidelined with an abdominal strain. Powered by LeBron James and Dwyane Wade , Miami won three straight games to take the series, 4–2. The series was marked by several suspensions, flagrant fouls, and confrontations between the players: Tyler Hansbrough 's flagrant foul on Dwyane Wade (which drew blood), Udonis Haslem's retaliatory flagrant foul on Hansborough (which led to Haslem's Game 6 suspension), Wade colliding with Darren Collison in transition, Juwan Howard confronting Lance Stephenson over the latter's flashing of the choke sign to James, and Dexter Pittman elbowing Stephenson in the neck (which led to his own three-game suspension). Indiana's Danny Granger received technical fouls in three consecutive games for his confrontations with Heat players; he stripped James of his headband in Game 2 while attempting to block a shot, pulled the back of James' jersey in Game 3 while trying to stop a fast-break, and chest-bumped Wade in Game 4 after the latter was fouled by Roy Hibbert . , The following season saw improvements for both teams, from Miami's acquisition of Ray Allen and Chris Andersen , to the emergence of Paul George and Lance Stephenson . Notably, it was after the Heat lost to the Pacers that they compiled a 27-game winning streak; the last time the Heat lost two in a row in the year were the games against Indiana and Portland. During the waning minutes of Game 6 in the Semifinals between the Pacers and the New York Knicks , the Pacers' fans were chanting "Beat The Heat" as their team beat their old New York rivals. True to form, the Heat and the Pacers met in the Conference Finals of the 2013 NBA Playoffs on May 22, 2013. Several instances of physicality became prominent in the series: Shane Battier received an offensive foul for throwing his knee at Hibbert's midsection; Hibbert claimed that it was intentional dirty play on the part of Battier. Andersen suffered a bloodied nose after colliding with David West . Ian Mahinmi received a retroactive flagrant foul for a grab of James' arm. Norris Cole latched a hand on West's groin area as he tried to slip through West. Wade received a retroactive flagrant foul for hitting Stephenson in the head, another incident that the Pacers, notably Paul George, felt was a dirty play. The Heat survived Game 1 on a James game-winning layup, while the Pacers came back to tie the series at 1–1 after forcing James into two late fourth-quarter turnovers for Game 2. In Game 3, the Heat set a team record for points in a postseason half with 70. It was the first time the Pacers had given up 70 points since 1992. Allen's single turnover was the least ever suffered by the Heat in a first half. Their five total turnovers is tied for the fewest in franchise history. The Game 3 victory marked the first time that an NBA team had won five straight road games by double digits. The Heat won the series 4–3, with a 99–76 win in game 7.  In the 2014 NBA Playoffs, after beating the Brooklyn Nets in five games, and the Pacers beating the Washington Wizards in six games, the Heat and the first-seeded Pacers would meet up in the Eastern Conference Finals in a much-anticipated rematch. The Heat would go on to eliminate the Pacers 4–2 games, advancing to their fourth consecutive NBA Finals in the Big Three-era. The Heat stumbled during Game 1 in Indianapolis, falling 96–107. They would win Games 2–4. During Game 5 (which Miami lost 90–93), James struggled, suffering heavy foul trouble and scoring only 7 points, his lowest Playoff record. During Game 6 in Miami, the Heat would blow out the Pacers 117–92. , The Heat-Mavericks rivalry began in the 2006 NBA Finals , where the two teams met and both entering their first NBA Finals appearance. A year prior, the Heat had acquired Shaquille O'Neal . The Mavericks were led by Dirk Nowitzki , and the Heat were led by Dwyane Wade . Dallas had home-court advantage in the series due to a better regular season record (60-22) than Miami's (52-30) and took the first two games in the series, entering Game 3 with a commanding 2-0 lead. They looked set to win Game 3 until a rally by the Heat, including many free throws from Wade, resulted in the Mavericks losing the third game. The Heat won all of its home games, as the Mavericks dropped games 3, 4 and 5. Game 5 was a very controversial game, a 101-100 victory for the Heat, Wade shot more free-throws than the entire Mavericks squad. Mavericks owner Mark Cuban as well as Nowitzki were both fined for acts of misconduct. During Game 6, the series returned to Dallas, where the Mavericks fell 92-95. Jason Terry airballed a three-point attempt that could have tied the game. Wade picked up the ball, throwing it in the air in celebration as the Heat won the NBA Championship, and its first one as well. Wade was named the Finals MVP. , In the 2010 off-season, Miami acquired LeBron James from the Cleveland Cavaliers and Chris Bosh from the Toronto Raptors to team up with Wade and form their own "big three" (to rival the Celtics ' big three) that was expected to win the championship. The Heat finished 58-24, acquiring the southeast division title and the second seed in the Eastern Conference. During the regular season, the Mavericks swept the Heat 2-0. The Heat cruised through the Playoffs without much competition, eliminating every team - the Philadelphia 76ers , defending Eastern Conference champions Boston Celtics and the top-seeded Chicago Bulls all five games. Meanwhile, the Mavericks had tallied 57-25 for the third seed, leaving them to face the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round. The Mavericks had been defeated in the first round all but one time since the 2006 finals, including a defeat from the seventh-seeded San Antonio Spurs just the previous season. Because of this, the Mavericks were underdogs throughout the playoffs, but they were able to dispatch Portland in six games. They faced the defending NBA champions Los Angeles Lakers and pulled off the impossible by sweeping them, ending their bid for a three-peat. In the conference finals, they defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder , resulting a rematch between the two teams. After taking a 2-1 lead however, the Heat stumbled in the next three games. They were eliminated on their own home floor after losing 95-105 during Game 6 in Miami - extending LeBron's quest for a ring. The loss had also brought further public humiliation for LeBron James , who had been scrutinized and negatively criticized for leaving the Cavaliers to join the Heat. LeBron was criticized for only averaging 17.8 points. Cavaliers fans rejoiced in the Heat's loss due the anger that was caused by LeBron's decision to join the Heat, which they felt was unfair and a betrayal. , After that, the Mavericks would never win another game against the Heat. Dallas hosted the Heat for the season opener on December 25, 2011 of the 2011-2012 NBA Season lockout season that was shortened to 66 games. The Heat spoiled the Mavericks' championship banner-raising night, giving them a 105-94 blowout loss. , Although the Heat and the Mavericks have not met in the post-season ever since, the rivalry continued as Mark Cuban publicly discussed his extreme personal dislike for the Heat. He described "hate" was not being strong-enough of a word to describe his dislike for the Heat.  He also had a personal dislike for Wade. , The Heat and Spurs also developed a recent rivalry, coming off from two consecutive NBA finals match-ups which many feel has ignited a feud between the Heat and Texas basketball teams overall. The first time the two teams met was during the 2013 NBA Finals , where the Spurs entered their fifth NBA Finals appearance and the Heat entered their third consecutive appearance. It was LeBron James's second time facing the Spurs in the Finals, having faced them in 2007 in a crushing four-game sweep. It was the Heat's third time playing a Texas team. The Heat had home-court advantage since their record (66-16) was better than San Antonio's (58-24) with Miami as the highly favored team. The Heat fell during Game 1, 88-92 after a late upsurge led by Tony Parker . They evened the series during Game 2 with a 103-99 victory. The Heat went through a roller-coaster alternation of wins and losses which extended the series to a deciding Game 7 in Miami. The series experienced many feats, in which Ray Allen had his record for most-threes in a Finals broken by Danny Green . During Game 5, despite strong performances from LeBron James , Dwyane Wade and Ray Allen , the Heat still lost 104-114. During Game 6 in Miami, Ray Allen made a game-saving clutch three-pointer to tie the game and save Miami's season. The Heat would win games 6 and 7, completing the championship repeat, a loose reminiscent of and similar fashion as the 2010 NBA Finals between the Lakers and the Celtics. James was named the Finals MVP. The Heat also handed the Spurs their first NBA Finals loss, becoming the first team to beat them. , The two teams met again in the 2014 finals , however each team experienced opposite fortunes. The Spurs entered with a 62-20 record and home-court advantage after eliminating the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference Finals. The Heat entered with a 54-28 regular season record, and eliminated the Indiana Pacers , who were the top seed in the Eastern Conference to earn their fourth consecutive NBA finals trip. However, unlike the 2013 NBA Finals, the Heat were eliminated in a five-game sweep, which ended LeBron and the Heat's quest for a three-peat. The Heat were blown in each loss by at least 15 points or more. The Spurs would win their fifth NBA championship. During Game 1 in San Antonio, LeBron suffered leg cramps due to dehydration because of a massive technical failure in the AT&T Center. They key slogan was the oxymoron "too hot for the Heat". During Game 2, the Heat evened the series with a 98-96 victory, raising Miami's hopes for an eventual series comeback victory due to their recent history of rebounding from deficits. It did not happen, and Miami lost the next three games. During Game 3, the Heat had its home-winning streak snapped with a 92-111 loss, and were again blown out in Game 4. Game 5 (which ended up in a 84-107 loss for Miami) would be LeBron's last day playing as a member of the Heat. During the 2014 free-agency, LeBron opted out of his Miami contract and went to return to the Cleveland Cavaliers . , The Heat's flagship radio stations are WAXY (790 AM) in English,  with Mike Inglis and John Crotty calling games, and WQBA (1140 AM) in Spanish, with Jose Pañeda and Joe Pujala on the call. , The Heat games are televised primarily by Sun Sports with Eric Reid and Tony Fiorentino . Reid has been part of the Heat's broadcasting team since the beginning of the franchise, first serving as a color analyst, and later becoming the lead play-by-play voice starting in the 1991–92 season. For the first four years of the franchise, there were radio-television simulcasts of locally-broadcast games before the franchise eventually created separate broadcast teams. , WBFS-TV (channel 33) was the original over-the-air flagship station for Heat games, with its first stint concluding at the end of the 1998–99 season , after eleven seasons. WAMI-TV (channel 69) took over the following season ; however, WBFS (along with now-sister station WFOR channel 4) returned as the Heat's primary over-the-air home in 2000–01 , this time lasting until the 2003–04 season . On the cable side, Heat games were televised on then-SportsChannel Florida (now Fox Sports Florida ), before moving to then-Sunshine Network (now Sun Sports) starting in the 1992–93 season. Since 2004–05, Sun Sports have served as the exclusive regional carrier of Heat games throughout the team's designated broadcast territory, which includes the metropolitan areas of Miami–Fort Lauderdale , West Palm Beach–Fort Pierce–Port St. Lucie , and Fort Myers–Naples . , On a national scale, games are occasionally televised by TNT , ESPN , or ABC . , From 1988–1993, the Heat were on WQAM . WINZ previously aired games from 1993–1996 and WIOD did from 1996–2008. , The Heat have retired three numbers, although only two of the players played for the franchise. Michael Jordan was the first player to be honored despite not having played for the Heat. Pat Riley retired Jordan's signature No. 23 before his final game in Miami during the 2002–03 season as a tribute to his career.  , During the 2005–06 season the organization honored Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino 's No. 13 in respect of his contributions to the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League (NFL).  However, the No. 13 jersey is not retired and is still available for use by the Heat players. , There have been six head coaches for the Miami Heat. Ron Rothstein was the franchise's first head coach, serving from 1988 through 1991; he remains as assistant coach. Kevin Loughery was his successor from 1991 to 1995, guiding the Heat to their first two playoff berths in 1992 and 1994. Loughery was fired 46 games into the 1994–1995 season, posting a 17–29 record. Alvin Gentry , an assistant coach who joined in 1991, was brought in to replace Loughery on an interim basis. Miami went 15–21 for the final 36 games, and Gentry moved to the Detroit Pistons the following season. , In the summer of 1995, owner Micky Arison hired Pat Riley as the head coach and team president. At eleven years, Riley is the longest tenured head coach in the franchise's history, as well its all-time leader in total wins and games coached. Upon suffering a 25–57 record in the 2002–2003 season, Riley abruptly announced his retirement, but remained as team president. He elevated assistant coach Stan Van Gundy as his replacement. Van Gundy is Miami's all-time leader for the highest winning percentage in the regular season (.605), having led Miami to a 42–40 record in his first season and a 59–23 record in his second year. He spearheaded Miami's 2005 campaign, where they held the top seed in the east, swept their first two playoff opponents and made it to the Conference Finals. , An 11–10 record early into the 2005–2006 season prompted Riley to come out of retirement and replace Van Gundy. Shortly thereafter, Riley would win his fifth and final championship as a head coach, as well as Miami's first championship in 2006. Riley would retire permanently following the 15-win 2007–2008 season, but once again remained as team president. His hand-picked replacement, longtime assistant Erik Spoelstra , is the current Heat head coach, a position he has held since 2008. At 38, he was the youngest head coach in the league at the time, as well as the first Filipino-American head coach in league history. Throughout his brief tenure, Spoelstra has not missed the playoffs, even taking the team to four consecutive appearances in the NBA Finals , culminating in back-to-back championships in 2012 and 2013. , 2012–2013 , Mario Chalmers , January 12, 2013 , NBA Most Valuable Player , NBA Finals MVP , NBA All-Star Game MVP , NBA Scoring Champion , NBA Defensive Player of the Year , NBA Most Improved Player Award , Best NBA Player ESPY Award , NBA Coach of the Year , NBA Executive of the Year , J.

The Magic are part of the Southeast Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The franchise was established in 1989 as an expansion franchise, and such notable NBA stars as Shaquille O'Neal , Penny Hardaway , Patrick Ewing , Grant Hill , Tracy McGrady , Steve Francis , Dwight Howard , Vince Carter , and Rashard Lewis have played for the club throughout its young history. The franchise has also been in the playoffs for more than half of its existence (14 playoff appearances in 24 years). , Orlando has been the second most successful of the four expansion teams brought into the league in 1988 and 1989 in terms of winning percentage, after the Miami Heat . The club is currently one of two teams in the major North American professional sports leagues to play in the city of Orlando (the other is Major League Soccer (MLS)' Orlando City SC ). , , , In September 1985, Orlando businessman Jaskaran Singh approached Philadelphia 76ers general manager Pat Williams as they met in Texas on his idea of bringing an NBA team to Orlando. Intrigued by the project, Williams signed on as the front man of the investment group one year later as he left the 76ers. On June 19, 1986, the two held a news conference to announce their intention of seeking an NBA franchise.   , At the same time Hewitt and Williams decided to hold a contest in the Orlando Sentinel newspaper to get names for their new franchise. Out of a total of 4,296 submitted entries, the names were subsequently narrowed to four, "Heat", "Tropics", "Juice" and "Magic". The last one was picked after Williams' brought his 7-year-old daughter Karyn to visit in Orlando.  On July 27, 1986, it was announced that the committee chose the Magic to be the new name of the Orlando franchise in the NBA.  The name "Magic" alludes to the city's biggest tourist attraction and economic engine Walt Disney World .   , Many, including Williams himself at first, thought that Miami or Tampa were better locations in Florida for a franchise, given Orlando was a small town lacking a major airport and a suitable arena.  Hewitt brought investors such as real estate developer William DuPont, Orlando Renegades owner Don Dizney, and Southern Fruit Citrus owners Jim and Steve Caruso,  and talked the Orlando city officials into approving an arena project.  Meanwhile, Williams gave presentations to NBA commissioner David Stern and the owners of the other teams of the league that the town was viable.  , The Magic were one of the four new expansion franchises awarded by the NBA in 1987 along with the Charlotte Hornets , Miami Heat and Minnesota Timberwolves . Initially, the NBA was planning to expand by three teams, with one franchise going to Florida; however, when both Miami, and Orlando ownership groups made successful pitches, the expansion committee decided to expand by four teams, allowing both to have a franchise.  The Magic became the first ever major-league professional sports franchise in the Orlando area, following an expansion fee of reportedly $32.5 million.   The Magic hired Matt Guokas as the team's first coach, who helped the Magic select twelve players in the NBA Expansion Draft on June 15, 1989. On June 27, 1989, the Magic chose Nick Anderson with the 11th pick in the first round, who became the first draft pick of the franchise.  , The very first game played was an exhibition game on October 13, 1989 against the then reigning champions Detroit Pistons, which the Magic won.  DuPont was quoted as saying the atmosphere and the people watching the game was "like Game 7 of the NBA Finals." , On November 4, 1989, the Magic played their first season game at the Orlando Arena (O-Rena) against the visiting New Jersey Nets , who won 111–106 in a hard-fought game. The Magic's first victory came two days later, as the Magic defeated the New York Knicks 118–110. The inaugural team compiled a record of 18–64 with players including Reggie Theus , Scott Skiles , Terry Catledge , Sam Vincent , Otis Smith , and Jerry Reynolds .   , In the 1990 NBA Draft , the Orlando Magic selected Dennis Scott with the fourth overall pick.  On December 30, 1990, Scott Skiles racked up 30 assists in the 155–116 victory over the Denver Nuggets , breaking Kevin Porter 's NBA single-game assists record (29).  Skiles was named the NBA's Most Improved Player at the end of the season, as the Magic heralded the NBA's most improved record that season. Forward Dennis Scott set a team mark with 125 three-point field goals for the season, the best long-distance production by a rookie in NBA history.  He was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team.  Despite a 31–51 record, there were 40 sellouts out of 41 home games. , On September 19, 1991, the DeVos family purchased the franchise for $85 million and the family head Richard DeVos became the owner of the franchise.  The 1991–92 season was disappointing for the Magic as various players missed games with injuries. Dennis Scott played only 18 games, Nick Anderson missed 22 games, Stanley Roberts, Jerry Reynolds, Brian Williams, Sam Vincent and Otis Smith all missed at least 27 games each. With a shortage of healthy players the team struggled through a 17-game losing streak and finished with a 21–61 record. The Magic still managed to have all 41 home games sold out.  , The Magic history was changed on May 17, 1992, when the franchise won the first pick in the 1992 NBA Draft Lottery.  The Magic selected big-man Shaquille O'Neal from Louisiana State University , the biggest prize in the draft since the Knicks won Patrick Ewing .  O'Neal, a 7-foot 1 inch center , made an immediate impact on the Magic, leading the club to a 41–41 record.  The Magic again became the NBA's most improved franchise, as they improved by 20 games. O'Neal was the first rookie to be voted an All-Star starter since Michael Jordan in 1985.  He also became the 1992–1993 NBA Rookie of the Year . Despite O'Neal's presence, the Magic missed the 1993 NBA Playoffs because they were tied with the Indiana Pacers for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference with the Pacers holding the tiebreaker. , Despite barely missing the playoffs and receiving the least chance of gaining the top draft pick with only one ball in the lottery, the Magic again won the first pick in the 1993 NBA Draft Lottery.  Prior to the draft, Guokas stepped down as head coach, and Brian Hill was promoted to become the Magic's second head coach.  In the draft, the Magic selected Chris Webber , but traded him to the Golden State Warriors for the number three pick, guard Anfernee "Penny" Hardaway and three future first-round draft picks.  With the combination of O'Neal and Hardaway, the Magic became a dominant team in the NBA, compiling the first 50 win season in franchise history with a 50–32 record.  The Magic were in the playoffs for the first time, ranked the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference; however, the Pacers swept the Magic 3–0 in the first round, thus ending the Magic's season.  , In the 1994–95 season , the Magic's sixth season, All-Star forward Horace Grant was acquired as a free agent from the Chicago Bulls .  Orlando Magic compiled a 57–25 record, best in the East and winning the Atlantic Division title,  becoming the second-fastest team to advance to the NBA Finals in league history.  In the playoffs, the Magic defeated the Boston Celtics , Bulls, and the Indiana Pacers , advancing to the NBA Finals where O'Neal, Hardaway and the young Magic bowed to a more playoff-experienced Hakeem Olajuwon and the Houston Rockets , taking their second consecutive crown in a 4–0 sweep of Orlando.  , In the 1995–96 season , the Magic again were near the top of the Eastern Conference and the Atlantic Division with a 60–22 record, led by O'Neal and Hardaway; however, the Magic were seeded number two, behind the NBA all-time best 72–10 record of the Chicago Bulls .  In the meantime, General Manager Pat Williams was promoted to Senior Executive Vice President and replaced by the Vice President of Basketball Operations John Gabriel on April 29, 1996.  In the playoffs, after the Magic defeated the Detroit Pistons and the Atlanta Hawks , Orlando met the Bulls in the Eastern Conference Finals.  The combination of Jordan, Scottie Pippen and rebounder Dennis Rodman was too much for the Magic, and Orlando was swept 4–0.  , In the offseason, O'Neal left as a free agent to the Los Angeles Lakers , dealing a huge blow to the Magic franchise.  In the middle of the season, urged by player discontent, management fired coach Brian Hill and named Richie Adubato as interim coach for the rest of the season. Under Adubato, the Magic went 21–12 to compile a 45–37 record, led by Penny Hardaway . In the playoffs, the Magic quickly fell 0–2 to the heavily favored Miami Heat in the first round, but Hardaway battled back with consecutive 40 point games to assure a game five (the first player to do so), which the Magic ultimately lost. , The Magic then hired Chuck Daly to be head coach for the 1997–98 season .  In addition, Hall of Famer Julius Erving joined the Magic's front office, giving Orlando hope for a successful season. The season was hampered by an injury to Hardaway who sat out the majority of the season. Anderson, combined with newly acquired free agent Bo Outlaw , led the team to a 41–41 record, just out of reach of the NBA playoffs. In addition, Seikaly was traded during the season to the New Jersey Nets for three role players and a future draft pick.  , In 1998–99 , with the drafting of Michael Doleac and Matt Harpring with the 12th and 15th picks in the 1998 draft, and a healthy Penny Hardaway and Nick Anderson, the Magic tied for the Eastern Conference's best record with the Miami Heat in the lockout-shortened season, 33–17. Armstrong again led the team emotionally, winning the NBA's Sixth-Man and Most Improved Player awards. Orlando also acquired NBA great Dominique Wilkins , along with brother Gerald, who were past their primes but were both still serviceable NBA players. In the playoffs the Penny Hardaway-led Magic were seeded number 3 because of tiebreakers and faced the Philadelphia 76ers . The 76ers, led by Allen Iverson , upset the Magic 3–1 in the first round.  The team also changed their uniforms for the first time ever, changing from pinstripes to stars. , In 1999, the Magic, under General Manager John Gabriel , who was later named Executive of the Year, hired rookie-coach Doc Rivers .  Gabriel dismantled the previous team trading their only remaining superstar Anfernee Hardaway to the Phoenix Suns for Danny Manning (who never donned a Magic uniform), Pat Garrity , and two future draft picks.  The Magic were then a team composed of virtually all no name players and little experience which included team captain Armstrong, Bo Outlaw and a young Ben Wallace , along with Coach Rivers led the Magic to a 41–41 record, barely missing out on the playoffs. At the end of the season Rivers was named Coach of the Year . That year was characterized by the slogan "Heart and Hustle", as the team was known for its hard-working style. , The following offseason, Gabriel, with millions of cleared salary cap space, attempted to lure three of the NBA's most prized free agents: Tim Duncan , Grant Hill , and Tracy McGrady . Duncan opted to remain with the San Antonio Spurs , the Magic acquired Hill, a perennial All-Star , and McGrady. With McGrady and Hill together, the Magic were expected to be a force in the East. However, Hill was limited to 4 games because of an ankle injury. McGrady blossomed into a star during the season, becoming one of the NBA's top scorers. With the addition of Mike Miller from the draft, the Magic compiled a 43–39 record, which included a nine-game winning streak, and once again made the playoffs. McGrady made the All-Star Team and All-NBA 2nd Team. Miller won the Rookie of the Year . In the playoffs, they faced the Milwaukee Bucks team in the first round. The Bucks won the series 3–1. , In 2001–02 , McGrady led the Magic to a winning record of 44–38. Hill was still severely limited by his ankle injury, and did not play for the vast majority of the season. McGrady, combined with Armstrong, Miller, and 3-point sharpshooter Pat Garrity , formed the core of the team. McGrady made the All-NBA for the first time and made his second consecutive All-Star Team. However, the Magic were defeated 3–1 in the first round of the playoffs by the Charlotte Hornets led by Baron Davis .  , In 2002–03 , with the acquisitions of Gordan Giricek and Drew Gooden from the Memphis Grizzlies in exchange for Mike Miller , McGrady once again led the Magic to a 42–40 record. McGrady led the league in scoring with 32.1 ppg, made his second All-NBA 1st Team, and 3rd All-Star Team. Despite still not having Hill due to injury, the Magic entered the playoffs for the third straight year. However, after taking a 3–1 lead in the best-of-seven first round series, the Magic fell to the Detroit Pistons 4–3 in the now infamous heartbreaker in which McGrady was quoted "It's nice to finally be in the second round" after still needing one more win to advance. , The Magic's 15th season in 2003–04 proved to be one of its toughest ever. Even with the acquisition of veteran free agents Tyronn Lue and Juwan Howard , the Magic struggled early. After winning its first game, the Magic lost 19 consecutive games, setting a franchise record. The Magic finished an NBA worst with, 21–61. Despite this, McGrady led the league in scoring with 28.0 ppg, made the All-NBA 2nd Team and his 4th consecutive All-Star Team. In the middle of the 19-game losing streak, coach Doc Rivers was fired, and assistant Johnny Davis was promoted.  Also, general manager Gabriel was replaced by John Weisbrod .  , In the off-season, Weisbrod completely dismantled the team. Though he kept Davis as coach, he shook up the player roster, only keeping a few players from last season. The most significant trade was Tracy McGrady . McGrady, discontent with the Magic, wished to move on; Weisbrod accused McGrady of "slacking off" and not attending practices (McGrady later admitted that he did not give 100% percent during the 2003–2004 season and wanted the team to bring him some help, but never wanted to leave Orlando). The Magic traded McGrady along with Reece Gaines , Tyronn Lue , and Juwan Howard to the Houston Rockets for Steve Francis , Kelvin Cato , and Cuttino Mobley .  In addition, the Magic acquired center Tony Battie and two second-round draft picks from the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Drew Gooden, Steven Hunter , and the draft rights to Anderson Varejão .  The Magic then signed free agent Hedo Türkoğlu . With the number one draft pick, the Magic selected high-school phenomenon and future All-Star and franchise cornerstone Dwight Howard and traded for point guard Jameer Nelson . Nelson, who most scouts speculated to be a top-10 pick, fell to the 20th pick, and the Magic traded a future first-round draft pick to the Denver Nuggets for Nelson. , After a promising 13–6 start, the Magic began to fall apart. First, Weisbrod traded Mobley for Doug Christie from the Sacramento Kings . Christie, because of his emotional ties to the Kings, at first refused to play for the Magic. Later on, Christie claimed he had bone spurs and was placed on the injured list after playing only a few games for the Magic. Near the end of the season, with a playoff-push faltering, Weisbrod fired Davis after leading Davis to believe he was going to be the team's head coach for the entire 2004–05 NBA season . He then promoted Chris Jent to interim head coach. Throughout the season, bolstered by Hill's return, the Magic played spectacularly, defeating top NBA teams. However, led by the erratic play of Francis, the Magic also lost to league teams with losing records. Howard showed great promise, becoming one of the few players to average a double-double. Howard was a consistent rebounder and scorer, becoming the first rookie to start and play all 82 games in a season. In addition, Nelson, after a slow start, developed into a talented player, taking over the starting point guard position. Hill also returned and averaged 19.7 points a game. Hill was chosen an All-Star starter by NBA fans for the 2005 All-Star Game, and Dwight Howard and Jameer Nelson were named to the All-Rookie first and second teams, respectively. Howard was a unanimous selection. , The Magic finished the season 36–46.  Their playoff push was hampered by injuries in the last quarter of the season: a season-ending broken wrist for sixth man Hedo Türkoğlu , a shin injury to Grant Hill , a rib cage injury to Nelson, and a three-game suspension to Francis for kicking a photographer. The Magic ended a few games out of the playoffs. On May 23, 2005, the Magic's plans were disrupted by the abrupt resignation of General Manager and Chief Operating Officer John Weisbrod .  In addition, the Magic announced the following day that Brian Hill , the coach who led the Magic to the NBA Finals under O'Neal and Hardaway, would return as head coach.  , The Magic drafted Galician Fran Vazquez with the 11th pick in the 2005 NBA Draft . On July 28, 2005, Vazquez stunned the team after announcing that he would remain in Spain to play for Akasvayu Girona , getting ridiculed by media after he was quoted that the decision to stay was made by his girlfriend. [ citation needed ] Owner Rich DeVos announced on October 21 that he was transferring ownership to his children, with the official owner role moving to son-in-law and team President Bob Vander Weide. The transfer was supposed to be complete by the end of the year.  , The 2005–06 season opened with high hopes for the Magic despite not being able to add first round draft pick Vasquez. Grant Hill was supposedly finally healed from his multiple ankle surgeries. Dwight Howard and Jameer Nelson showed excellent progress during summer-league play. Second round draft pick Travis Diener showed excellent shooting and decision making during the summer. And the free agent signing of Keyon Dooling showed that the club was going to continue making progress. Then trouble began. Hill, despite his ankle apparently being healed, suffered a painful sports hernia injury that would hamper his play throughout the entire season. After playing in three preseason games, he underwent surgery to correct the hernia and would not appear during the regular season until mid-December, to which he lasted a month before attempting to make another comeback in February and early March, however he only played sporadically. Then a foot injury to Nelson forced him to sit out over a month. , On February 15, 2006, the Magic announced that they had acquired Darko Miličić and Carlos Arroyo from the Detroit Pistons in exchange for Kelvin Cato and a 2007 top-five protected first-round draft pick. One week later, on February 22, the Magic announced that they had traded Steve Francis to the New York Knicks in exchange for Anfernee Hardaway (whom they waived two days later) and Trevor Ariza . With a set starting rotation of Battie, Howard, Türkoğlu, DeShawn Stevenson , and Nelson, the Magic mounted a surprising run at the eighth playoff spot in the Eastern Conference, including an 8-game winning streak and twelve consecutive home wins. The streak included wins against NBA powerhouses Detroit, San Antonio, Dallas and Miami, as well as a game against the Philadelphia 76ers in which Howard recorded 28 points and a career-high 26 rebounds. Despite their efforts they didn't make the playoffs. , With the 11th overall pick in the 2006 NBA Draft , the Magic took the former Duke star J. J. Redick . Even with the fan support to get him playing time he averaged just over 11 minutes a game. After beginning the season strong with a 13–4 record, the Orlando Magic began to suffer in the standings as the result of multiple losses, due in large part to the injuries of Tony Battie, Keyon Dooling, and Grant Hill. The Magic were also hampered with the sporadic play of many of their young stars, who on multiple occasions showed their propensity for streaky shooting and the team's lack of a solid scoring two-guard. Despite the team's poor play, Dwight Howard continued to develop and blossom in his third year in the league, culminating in his first selection to the Eastern Conference All-Star team. The final few weeks of the season saw the Magic build momentum and confidence with an impressive late push towards the Playoffs. On April 15, 2007, with an 88–86 victory over the Boston Celtics , the Magic secured its first berth in the NBA Playoffs since 2003 by locking up the 8th seed in the Eastern Conference. This marked the first time that the team had made the playoffs while posting a losing record. Nevertheless, their Playoff run ended on April 28, 2007 after they were swept in the first round by first seeded Detroit Pistons whose experience, veteran leadership and ability to consistently make the clutch basket proved far too much for the undermanned and overwhelmed Magic to overcome. It was announced on May 23, 2007, that Brian Hill had been fired as head coach of the Magic. , On June 1, 2007, the Magic signed Billy Donovan to be their head coach for five years. The next day, Donovan wished to be released from the contract and the Magic agreed several days later. On June 6, 2007, the Magic signed a 4-year contract with Stan Van Gundy . In the free agent market, the Magic signed Rashard Lewis of the Seattle SuperSonics to a six-year league-maximum contract believed to be worth over $110 million.  At the NBA China Games, the Magic swept the three games in China, twice against the Cleveland Cavaliers and once against the Chinese national team in games held in Shanghai and in Macau . , On November 15, 2007, Bob Vander Weide, the son-in-law of Richard DeVos, officially took over as owner of the team, although ownership is still split evenly amongst Richard DeVos' other children as well.  , The Magic started the 2007–08 NBA season with an impressive 16–4 record in their first 20 games, which included wins over the Boston Celtics and Cleveland Cavaliers . Through the next few months, the Magic were not so successful, splitting their next 36 games with 18 wins and 18 losses. At the start of March, the Magic seemed to pick up speed again, finishing the month with 10 wins, the first time since November that they won 10 or more in a month. The Magic clinched the Southeast Division title when the Washington Wizards were routed at Utah 129–87 on March 31, 2008. It was the Magic's third division title, but only their first since 1995–96 season, as well as their first since the Southeast Division was formed. They also earned their 50th win of the season against the Chicago Bulls on April 13, which had not happened since the 1995–96 season. The Magic finished the regular season 52–30, their best season since 1995–96. With the 3rd seed in the Eastern Conference, they were matched up in their first round playoff series against the Toronto Raptors . The Magic had home court advantage for the first time since the 1998–99 season. , On April 28, 2008, at Amway Arena , the Magic eliminated the Raptors with a 4–1 series victory in the first round. It was the first playoff series victory for the Magic in 12 years after 6 straight first round exits. The run of success didn't last long as they fell 4–1 to the experienced Detroit Pistons in the second round. With the Magic already down in the series, controversy erupted after the Pistons' Game 2 victory. At the conclusion of the 3rd quarter, Chauncey Billups of the Pistons made a three-point shot giving the Pistons a three-point lead. However, the clock had stopped just as the play began. NBA rules prohibit officials from using instant replay or any timing device to determine how much time has elapsed when a clock malfunctions, nor is a replay allowed to be viewed from the time of the malfunction to when the play ends, when the game clock has not expired. Because of the rule, the officials then estimated that the play took 4.6 seconds, and because there were 5.1 seconds remaining when play began, the field goal was allowed to be counted. The NBA later admitted that the play actually took 5.7 seconds and the basket in question should not have counted.  The Pistons went on to win Game 2. The Magic were able to win Game 3, with the Pistons' Chauncey Billups out for most of the game with an injury, but were unable to take advantage of his absence and defeat the Pistons in Games 4 and 5, which ended the Magic's playoff run in 2008. , The first half of the 2008–09 season went very well for the Magic. After 41 games, the Magic were 33–8, leading the Southeast Division, as well as having one of the top four records in the league. At the start of February, Jameer Nelson , their all-star starting point guard, went down with a shoulder injury. He was expected to miss the remainder of the season. After trading for Rafer Alston , the Magic finished the regular season with a 59–23 record, it was the most games the team had won in a season since the 1995–96 season in which they had 60 wins. In the playoffs, the Magic beat the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round of the playoffs and then the defending champions, the Boston Celtics , in the Eastern Conference semifinals, behind assistant coach Patrick Ewing 's guarantee that they would win Game 7 of that series.  In their first conference finals since 1996, the Magic beat the Cleveland Cavaliers , which were led by the season's MVP, LeBron James . After dropping the first two games in the Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers , the Magic finally won their first ever game in the Finals in Game 3. Despite Nelson's return to the team for the Finals, the Lakers won the series and the championship by beating the Magic in five games. , In the 2009 off-season, Orlando traded Rafer Alston , Tony Battie , and Courtney Lee to the New Jersey Nets in exchange for eight-time All-Star Vince Carter and Ryan Anderson .  Hedo Türkoğlu , as part of a sign-and-trade , was sent to the Toronto Raptors . They then made several free agent signings. On July 10, former Dallas Mavericks power forward Brandon Bass was given a 4-year deal.  On July 21, the Magic signed former Phoenix Suns Forward Matt Barnes .  On August 19, they signed former Miami Heat point guard Jason Williams .  , On September 28, 2009, Orlando extended the contract of head coach Stan Van Gundy by exercising his option for the 2010–11 season. They did the same for General Manager Otis Smith , which would keep him in that position through the 2011–12 season.  , The Magic were without Rashard Lewis for the first 10 games of the 2009–10 season . Lewis tested positive for an elevated testosterone level that was caused by an over-the-counter supplement containing a substance banned by the league.  To make matters worse, Vince Carter suffered a left ankle injury in just the second game of the season. Carter's injury turned out to be not too serious, but caused him to miss the next five games. Another setback came in mid-November, when Jameer Nelson injured his left knee, which required arthroscopic surgery to repair. Nelson would be out for five weeks. Despite all of this, the Magic had a 23–8 record at the end of December. , Orlando lost seven of their first ten games in January, but recovered well enough to post a winning record for the month by winning six of their next seven. Following the All-Star break, the Magic went on a roll, winning 23 of their 28 remaining games, clinching their fourth consecutive playoff berth and winning their third consecutive division championship in the process. The Magic finished the regular season with a 59–23 record, matching their record from the 2008–09 season, and finishing with not only the second-best record in the Eastern Conference, but the second-best record in the entire league. The team became one of the only teams in NBA history to beat all of the other 29 teams at least once during the regular season. The Magic swept the Charlotte Bobcats and the Atlanta Hawks in the first two rounds of the playoffs , respectively. They then faced the Boston Celtics in the conference finals. After losing the first three games of the series, Orlando managed to win the next two games, but lost on the road in Game 6, ending their season. , In anticipation of the team's move to Amway Center , the Magic updated its logo. They retained the streaking ball logo, but changed the wordmark taken from their current uniforms. The Magic hosted the NBA All-Star Game in 2012. The Magic have also unveiled black alternate uniforms. , In the summer of 2010 the Orlando Magic signed Chris Duhon , formerly of the New York Knicks,  and Quentin Richardson , formerly of the Miami Heat. , On December 18, 2010, having lost five of their last six games, the Magic made a blockbuster trade deal with the Phoenix Suns and the Washington Wizards . They traded Vince Carter , Marcin Gortat and Mickaël Piétrus to Phoenix for Hedo Türkoğlu (who led them into the 2009 NBA Finals when they lost 4–1 against the Los Angeles Lakers ), Jason Richardson and Earl Clark . Rashard Lewis was traded to Washington for 3-time All-Star Gilbert Arenas .  , The Magic finished the season with 52 victories, good for 2nd in the Southeast Division. But they were ousted in six games by the Atlanta Hawks in the first round of the 2011 NBA Playoffs , the first time head coach Stan Van Gundy was eliminated early in the playoffs. , In a shortened 2012 season, due to the NBA Lockout, the Magic started the offseason on a rocky note, with their All-Star Center, Dwight Howard , requesting a trade to either the New Jersey Nets , Los Angeles Lakers , or Dallas Mavericks . Overlooking the trade request the Magic did a sign and trade with the Boston Celtics for Glen Davis and Von Wafer in exchange for Brandon Bass . The Magic also amnestied Gilbert Arenas and signed Larry Hughes , Justin Harper , and DeAndre Liggins .The Magic started the season on Christmas Day at Oklahoma against the Oklahoma City Thunder . They lost the season opener 89–97. During the month of February the Magic waived Hughes and signed Ish Smith . On February 26, Orlando hosted the 2012 All-Star Game. The Magic struggled to win games consistently, with concerns about the uncertainty of Dwight Howard's future with the franchise. However, after Dwight rescinded his trade demand and signed a one-year deal in March, the Magic seemed to find their footing again. But then in early April, shortly after it became public that Howard requested coach Van Gundy to be replaced, the center was diagnosed with a herniated disk and forced to have back surgery, thus ending his season. The Magic clinched the sixth seed in the east with a 37–29 record. The Magic were faced with the third seeded Pacers in the first round. Despite winning the first game of the series the Magic were defeated 4–1. , On May 21, 2012, it was reported that general manager Otis Smith and head coach Stan Van Gundy would part ways with the organization. Stan Van Gundy finished with a 259–135 regular season record with the team which included making the playoffs in those five years and a conference championship. , CEO Alex Martins announced former Oklahoma City assistant general manager Rob Hennigan as the new general manager for the Orlando Magic on June 20, 2012. He is currently the youngest general manager (30 years) in the league.  , In the 2012 NBA Draft , the Magic selected Andrew Nicholson and Kyle O'Quinn . , On June 25, 2012, Dwight Howard had face-to-face meeting with General Manager Rob Hennigan in Los Angeles and demanded a trade to the Brooklyn Nets .  , On July 9, 2012, the Magic completed a sign and trade deal with New Orleans Hornets , that sent forward Ryan Anderson to the Hornets. In return the Magic received center Gustavo Ayon . , On July 28, 2012, Jacque Vaughn was named the new head coach. He had been the assistant coach for the San Antonio Spurs for the last two seasons.  , On August 9, 2012, ESPN reported that a four-team trade would send Dwight Howard to the Los Angeles Lakers . ESPN.com's Marc Stein was told the Lakers were to acquire Howard, Chris Duhon and Earl Clark , the Denver Nuggets were to acquire Andre Iguodala , the Philadelphia 76ers were to acquire Andrew Bynum and Jason Richardson , and the Magic were to acquire Arron Afflalo , Al Harrington , Nikola Vucevic , Maurice Harkless , Josh McRoberts , Christian Eyenga , and five total protected future (three first-round, two second-round) picks from each of the other three teams.  The deal was officially confirmed and completed on August 10.  Howard left the Magic as their all-time leading scorer, shot blocker, and rebounder. , Following the trade of Dwight Howard, the Magic entered into a state of rebuilding with Maurice Harkless and Nikola Vucevic . On August 29, the Magic signed free agent guard E'Twaun Moore . On December 2, 2012, Howard's first game against his former team, the Magic defeated the Lakers 113–103. , On February 21, 2013, the Magic traded J.J. Redick , Ish Smith & Gustavo Ayón to the Milwaukee Bucks . In return, the Magic received Beno Udrih , Tobias Harris and rookie Doron Lamb . The Magic also traded Josh McRoberts to the Charlotte Bobcats for Hakim Warrick who was waived 2 days later. The Magic finish the 2012–2013 season 20–62 as the worst record in the NBA, missing the playoffs for the first time since 2006. , On June 27, 2013, the Orlando Magic had the 2nd pick in the 1st round of the NBA draft. The Magic used their lottery pick to draft Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year,  shooting guard Victor Oladipo from Indiana University . The Orlando Magic also had the 51st pick in the 2nd round of the NBA draft. They used this pick to draft 6"8 forward Romero Osby from the University of Oklahoma . Osby averaged 16 points, 7 rebounds, and 1.3 assists during his senior NCAA season at Oklahoma, but was cut by the Magic before the season opener. , The Magic finished the 2013–2014 season with a 23–59 record, 3rd worst in the NBA. The draft lottery gave them the 4th pick in the 2014 NBA Draft. In the draft they selected Aaron Gordon with the 4th pick and Dario Šarić with the 12th pick. Saric was then swapped for the 10th pick, Elfrid Payton in exchange for a 2017 1st round pick and a future 2nd round pick. Roy Devyn Marble was selected with the 56th pick in the 2nd round. On February 5th, 2015 Jacque Vaughn was relieved of his head coaching duties after coaching 2 1/2 seasons for the Magic. His overall record was 58–158. He was replaced by interim head coach James Borrego . , The team's new state of the art home arena, the Amway Center officially opened on October 1, 2010. The Orlando Magic hosted their first preseason game at Amway Center on October 10 against the New Orleans Hornets . The 2010–11 regular season home opener was on October 28 against the Washington Wizards , and the Magic won both games. In 2012, the Amway Center hosted the All-Star Weekend .  , At the time it opened, the new Amway Center was home to the largest Jumbotron in the NBA.  The arena also features approximately 2,100 feet (640 m) of digital ribbon boards, and outside the building a 46 feet (14 m) by 53 feet (16 m) video display is visible to motorists traveling on Interstate 4.  , The Amway Center is also the home of the minor league hockey team, Orlando Solar Bears . , Amway Arena opened in 1989 and served as home to the Orlando Magic since their inception until the 2009–2010 season. It was originally known as the Orlando Arena, or the "O-Rena", during its first ten years. In 1999, TD Waterhouse purchased the naming rights and named the venue the TD Waterhouse Centre. In December 2006, the naming rights were purchased by Amway for four years.  It is also home of the Arena Football League's Orlando Predators, the Orlando Sharks of the Major Indoor Soccer League , and various sporting and entertainment events. Amway Arena was one of "The Orlando Venues" owned and operated by the City of Orlando. The other facilities include the Bob Carr Performing Arts Centre , Tinker Field , the Florida Citrus Bowl , Harry P. Leu Gardens , and Mennello Museum.  Amway Arena was demolished by implosion on March 25, 2012. , The Magic were also the only NBA team to wear black sneakers and socks in all their games, a tradition that began upon the hiring of Stan Van Gundy in 2007; however they wore white sneakers and socks at home in all of the 2008–09 season and early in the 2009–10 season before switching back to black sneakers and socks. They have since switched back to wearing white sneakers and socks at home, except when wearing their black alternate uniforms. , The Magic participated in the NBA's "Hardwood Classics" campaign in 2003, debuting the retro black away jerseys from 1989 during Christmas Day. It was a little unusual to call the uniform a "retro" since the Magic wore them as recently as 1997–1998, however they have already had four jersey designs in only 20 seasons of play. The following season, they wore the 1994–95 blue alternates for "Hardwood Classics" and in 2005–06, they wore the home pinstriped jerseys from the inaugural year. In 2006–07, the Magic wore the black away retro jerseys again for "Hardwood Classics". They wore the same black throwbacks in 2009–10 and 2013–14, making it the most-used Hardwood Classics Nights uniform design since the promotion's inception in 2002. , Up until the current uniform revision, Bo Outlaw had been the only Magic player to have worn all of the Magic jersey designs, and during 2005–2006 "Hardwood Classics," he was the only player on the roster to wear the home pinstriped jersey when it was still the current uniform, having joined the team in 1997 (last season of the original pinstripe uniform). He repeated the same feat in 2006, wearing the black pinstriped jersey. , The following players have rights owned by the Orlando Magic. , 1 The number was unretired in 2001–2002 for Patrick Ewing . , 1 As assistant coach , The Orlando Magic and the Miami Heat had a rivalry based on the fact that the two franchises altogether were based in Florida in separate locations, known as the Sunshine State rivalry. Another ingredient to the rivalry was the high-caliber players on both teams such as Orlando's Shaquille O'Neal and Penny Hardaway to Miami's Alonzo Mourning and Tim Hardaway . The two had met each other in the NBA playoffs for the first time in 1997 , with Miami beating Orlando 3–2, they have not met in the corresponding playoffs ever since so far. , The rivalry had intensified in the past decade with the rising stardom of Dwyane Wade and Dwight Howard , along with Miami acquiring high-caliber stars such LeBron James from the Cavaliers and Chris Bosh from the Toronto Raptors and in 2010, resulting in fierce competition between the two. , Recently, when Dwight Howard departed from the Magic to the Los Angeles Lakers in August 2012, the rivalry has since softened as the Orlando Magic underwent a continuing process of rebuilding, however, competition still remains tense. , The Atlanta Hawks and the Orlando Magic had an intense rivalry, mostly stemming from playoff competitions and the rising stardom of Dwight Howard and Josh Smith , both from the 2004 NBA Draft and who were both raised in Georgia . , The two teams faced each other twice in the 2010 and 2011 NBA playoffs . The Magic had swept the Hawks in the second round of the 2010 playoffs and the Hawks eliminated the Magic 4–2 in the first round of the corresponding 2011 playoffs. , The current television announce team for the Orlando Magic is play-by-play announcer David Steele and color analyst Jeff Turner . Turner played for the Magic from its inaugural 1989 season to 1996. Paul Kennedy and Dante Marchetelli serve as courtside reporters, while Marchetelli and former Magic player Nick Anderson host the pre-game, halftime and post-game shows. Television broadcasts were split in 2007–08 between Fox Sports Florida and Sun Sports . In previous years, broadcasts were split between Sun Sports and local television stations, originally WKCF and, later, WRBW . , There was a controversy with moving broadcasts to Fox Sports Florida since Orlando's largest cable TV provider, Bright House Networks , did not carry the network. Pressure increased for the cable provider to pick up FS Florida in time for the 2007–08 NBA season but this did not happen. The Magic persisted with airing games on FS Florida into the 2008–09 season despite Bright House's refusal to pick up the channel in all of its affiliates. Recently, Bright House and FS Florida came to an agreement on January 1, 2009 and have begun airing the channel as part of its standard cable package. However, Bright House airs the channel using a digital signal that only allows customers who own the Digital cable box to receive the channel. The customers do not have to pay any additional costs to get the channel with their Digital cable box. , As of the 2012–13 season, all Magic games are now on Fox Sports Florida. , The current radio announce team for the Orlando Magic is play-by-play announcer Dennis Neumann and color analyst Richie Adubato , another former Magic head coach. Games are produced by Magic Radio Network flagship AM 580 WDBO in Orlando, and also broadcast on AM 1380 WELE in Daytona Beach, 99.5 FM WGMW "The Star" in Gainesville and Ocala, AM 1290 WPCF in Panama City, AM 1590 WPSL in Port St. Lucie and AM 1450 WSTU in Stuart. The Tampa Bay area affiliate is ESPN 1040 WHBO . The affiliate in Tallahassee is AM 1270 "The Team" WNLS . , The flagship broadcast was simulcast on WDBO-FM during the 2011–12 NBA season while that station moved from AM to FM. When WDBO-AM re-formatted from talk radio to sports radio , it retained the flagship status. However, WDBO-FM still simulcasts Magic games in Central Florida. , Joey Colon and Ramon Rivas do Spanish-language commentary on AM 1030 WONQ "La Grande" in Orlando. , The official Orlando Magic website features a collection of podcasts available on iTunes , including "Magic Overtime with Dante and Galante". , For career records, players currently on the team are in italics.

They are part of the Southeast Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The team plays their home games at the Verizon Center , in the Chinatown neighborhood of Washington, D.C. , , , The team now known as the Wizards began playing as the Chicago Packers in 1961, as the first modern expansion team in NBA history. After only one year, they changed their name to the Chicago Zephyrs . In 1963 the franchise moved to Baltimore , Maryland, and became the Baltimore Bullets, taking their name from a 1940s–'50s Baltimore Bullets BAA/NBA franchise and playing home games at the Baltimore Civic Center . In their first year in Baltimore, the Bullets finished fourth in a five–team Western Division.  , Prior to the 1964–65 NBA season the Bullets pulled off a blockbuster trade, sending Terry Dischinger , Rod Thorn and Don Kojis to the Detroit Pistons for Bailey Howell , Don Ohl , Bob Ferry and Wali Jones . The trade worked out well; Howell proved to be a hustling, fundamentally sound player who helped the Bullets get into the playoffs for the first time in franchise history. In the 1965 NBA Playoffs , the Bullets stunned the St. Louis Hawks 3–1, and advanced to the Western Conference finals. In the finals, Baltimore managed to split the first four games with the Los Angeles Lakers before losing the series 4–2. , In the late 1960s, the Bullets drafted two future Hall of Fame members: Earl Monroe , in the 1967 draft, number two overall, and Wes Unseld , in the 1968 draft, number two overall. The team improved dramatically, from 36 wins the previous season to 57 in the 1968–69 season , and Unseld received both the rookie of the year and MVP awards. The Bullets reached the playoffs with high expectations to go far, but they were eliminated by the New York Knicks in the first round. The next season the two teams met again in the first round, and although this one went to seven games, the Knicks emerged victorious again. , In the 1970–71 season , the 42–40 Bullets again met the Knicks, this time though in the Eastern Conference finals. With the Knicks team captain Willis Reed injured in the finals, the injury-free Bullets took advantage of his absence, and in game seven, at New York's Madison Square Garden , the Bullets' Gus Johnson made a critical basket late in the game to lift the Bullets over the Knicks 93–91 and advance to their first NBA Finals in franchise history. They were swept in four games by the powerful Milwaukee Bucks led by future Hall of Fame members Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (known in 1971 as Lew Alcindor) and Oscar Robertson . , Even after the trades of Earl Monroe (to the Knicks) and Gus Johnson (to the Suns), the Bullets remained a playoff contender throughout the 1970s. Following a less than spectacular 1971–72 NBA season , the Bullets acquired Elvin Hayes from the Houston Rockets and drafted Kevin Porter . , After a slow start, the Bullets began to make their charge in December, posting a 10–4 record on the way to capturing the Central Division title for the third straight year. The Bullets would again face the Knicks in the 1973 NBA Playoffs , losing for the fourth time in five series against New York. , In 1973, the team moved to Landover, Maryland and became the " Capital Bullets "; to avoid confusion with the Washington Capitals , they changed their name to the " Washington Bullets " the following season. , During November 1973, while waiting for the completion of their new arena in Landover, the Bullets played their home games at Cole Field House on the campus of the University of Maryland in College Park . The Capital Centre (later known as the USAir/US Airways Arena) opened on December 2, 1973, with the Bullets defeating the SuperSonics . Through the mid-1990s, the Bullets still played a few games per season in Baltimore . , The 60–22 Bullets made it back to the 1975 NBA Playoffs . That year Washington posted a 36–5 home record at the Capital Centre. In the first round of the playoffs, they survived a seven–game series against the Buffalo Braves as both teams won all of their games at home. In the Eastern Conference finals, they beat the defending NBA champion Boston Celtics in six games to advance to the NBA Finals . The Bullets were favorites to win the NBA Championship, but were swept by the Al Attles -led Golden State Warriors in four games, losing game four at the Capital Centre. , The loss at the NBA Finals lingered into the 1975–76 NBA season as they won 12 fewer games than last year, and in the playoffs they were eliminated by the Cleveland Cavaliers in 7 games. After the season the Bullets fired head coach K.C. Jones , despite having a career 62% winning percentage as the Bullets head coach. , In the 1976–77 NBA season under new head coach Dick Motta , the Bullets would again fall short of the Central Division title for the second straight year. Elvin Hayes finished sixth in the league in rebounds with 12.5 rebounds per game. After opening the 1977 NBA Playoffs with a three–game series victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers , the Bullets took a 2–1 series lead in the second round against the Houston Rockets . With a chance to take a 3–1 series lead at home, the Bullets lost 107–103, and the Rockets took the series in six games. , Although they had future hall of famers Elvin Hayes and Wes Unseld on the team, the Bullets finished the 77–78 season 44–38 and were a longshot to win the NBA Championship , but San Antonio journalist Dan Cook used the famed phrase " The opera ain't over 'til the fat lady sings ". This became the rallying cry for the Bullets as they finished a playoff run that led to the NBA Finals , defeating the Seattle SuperSonics in seven games to bring a professional sports championship to Washington D.C. for the first time in 36 years. , In the 1978–79 NBA season the Bullets moved to the Atlantic Division, capturing the title in their first season there. They entered the 1979 NBA Playoffs having lost eight of the final 11 games to finish the regular season at 54–28. In the playoffs the Bullets nearly blew a 3–1 series lead against the Atlanta Hawks , but managed to hold off the Hawks in seven games. , In the Eastern Conference finals, they trailed the San Antonio Spurs 3–1, but they mounted a comeback by winning two straight games to force a game seven at the Capital Centre. The Bullets rallied again, overcoming a fourth–quarter deficit to beat George Gervin and the Spurs 107–105 in one of the NBA's all-time greatest games and advance to the NBA Finals and a rematch with the Seattle SuperSonics . , In game one of the finals, the Bullets defeated the SuperSonics, 99–97, on two game-winning free throws. They lost the next four games, and the series, to Seattle. The Bullets were the only team to play in the NBA Finals four times during the 1970s. , Age and injuries finally caught up with the Bullets. In the 1979–80 NBA season , they barely made the playoffs as they captured the sixth and final playoff spot with a tiebreaker despite posting a 39–43 record. In the playoffs, they were swept by the Philadelphia 76ers in a 2–game playoff series. The following year the Bullets failed to make the playoffs for the first time in 13 years. Wes Unseld retired and Elvin Hayes was traded to the Houston Rockets the following season. , In '81 , Washington played strong under the coaching of Gene Shue and Don Moran , finishing the regular season with a 43–39 record, and although they advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals in the playoffs, they had clearly lost their form of the late 1970s. The 1982 Bullets continued to play with the same talent they had in the previous year. They finished with a winning record, but in a highly competitive Atlantic Division they finished last and missed the playoffs. , The next two years saw the Bullets continue to play mediocre basketball as they finished with losing records but they made the playoffs in the new expanded NBA Playoffs format that involved the 16 best teams to make the playoffs; the Bullets were eliminated in both years in the first round. , In 1985 , the Bullets acquired Manute Bol , whose specialty was blocking shots. That year, he blocked 397 shots (a Bullets record), part of a team that blocked 716 shots (a Bullets team record). But the Bullets finished with a disappointing 39–43 record, and were eliminated by the 76ers in the first round of the NBA Playoffs. The Bullets acquired center Moses Malone from the Philadelphia 76ers for center Jeff Ruland the following season for hope of improvement. Malone would lead the team in scoring with a 24.1 points per game as he would be joined by Jeff Malone who averaged 22.0 points per game. The Bullets' 42–40 record would be their last winning season until the 1996–97 NBA season . Washington was eliminated by the Detroit Pistons in 3 games in the playoffs. , The Bullets selected Muggsy Bogues twelfth overall in the '87 Draft, who at 5'3" is the smallest player in NBA history. The Bullets would get off to a slow start as coach Kevin Loughery was fired 27 games into the season with the Bullets holding an 8–19 record. To replace Loughery, the Bullets hired former MVP Wes Unseld. Under Unseld the Bullets improved as they were able to reach the playoffs again with a record of 38–44. After losing the first 2 games on the road in the first round of the 1988 NBA Playoffs to the Detroit Pistons , the Bullets fought back and forced a 5th game with 2 home wins. They would lose game 5 by 21 points. It would be 9 years before Washington would return to the NBA Playoffs. , The Bullets got off to a 5–1 start in 1989, but hopes of a good season faded quickly as they lost 16 of 18 games from mid-December to mid-January. They would finish with a 31–51 record despite stellar seasons by Jeff Malone and Bernard King , who averaged 24.3 and 22.3 points per game respectively to lead the team. , The lone highlight of the Bullets 30 win 1990–91 season was the successful comeback effort by Bernard King as he recovered from knee surgery he suffered while playing for the Knicks in the 1984–85 NBA season to finish 3rd in the NBA in scoring with a 28.4 points per game. In 1990, the team would name Susan O'Malley as its president, the first female president of a franchise in the history of the NBA. Susan O'Malley is the daughter of Peter O'Malley, the prominent lawyer from Maryland and former president of the Washington Capitals. , The Bullets would continue to struggle due to injuries and inconsistent play. They posted a 25-57 record in the 1991–92 season. Pervis Ellison was named 1992 Most Improved Player of The Year, averaging 20.0 points, 11.2 rebounds, and 2.7 blocks. Undrafted rookie Larry Stewart became the first undrafted player in NBA history to make an All-Rookie Team. The Bullets drafted Tom Gugliotta with their sixth overall pick in the 1992 NBA Draft . They would finished the 1992–93 season with a 22-60 record. After the season, the Bullets traded Harvey Grant to the Portland TrailBlazers for All-Star center Kevin Duckworth . , Injuries would continue to bite the Bullets as key players Rex Chapman and Calbert Cheaney (the club's 1st round draft pick) miss significant stretches, and Ellison misses almost the entire season. The result was a miserable 24–58 record for the 1993–94 season, but help from the Michigan Wolverines was on the way. Don MacLean was named 1994 Most Improved Player of the year, leading the Bullets with 18.2 points per game (tied with Chapman). In 1993, the Bullets did a rap music video of their version of Naughty By Nature 's rap single Hip Hop Hooray , featuring the rap trio themselves. , The Bullets selected Juwan Howard in the 1994 NBA Draft and traded Gugliotta along with three first round draft picks to the Golden State Warriors for the rights to Chris Webber . While the season started out with promise, a shoulder injury to Chris Webber (ironically against the Warriors) caused him to miss 19 games and the Bullets struggled through the rest of the season finishing a then franchise worst (percentage wise) 21–61. Webber averaged 20.1 ppg and 9.6 rpg but declined surgery for his dislocated shoulder. This would prove costly for the next season. The Bullets captured the heart of America after releasing their viral holiday video, "You da Man, You da Man, that's the reason I'm a Bullets Fan!" in 1994, which featured all 12 Bullets dancing in front of the Reflecting Pool in Washington, DC. , The Bullets' 95–96 season seemed over before it started as Webber suffered a dislocated left shoulder in a preseason game against Indiana on October 21 and opened the season on the injured list. He was activated on Nov. 27, but strained his shoulder against New York on Dec. 29. After hoping the injury would get better with rest, Webber finally underwent surgery on Feb. 1 which sidelined him for the remainder of the season. The Bullets were 9–6 with Webber in the lineup as he averaged a team-high 23.7 points plus 7.6 rebounds, 5.0 assists and 1.80 steals in 37.2 minutes per game when he was able to play. Other players injured included Mark Price (who only played in 7 games) and Robert Pack (31 games played out of 82). Bright spots of the season included the selection of Rasheed Wallace in the 1995 NBA Draft and the All-Star play of Howard. Juwan averaged a career best 22.1 ppg and 8.1 rpg and kept the Bullets slim playoff hopes alive until the end of the season. Center Gheorghe Muresan was named Most Improved Player of The Year, averaging 14.5 points, 9.6 rebounds, and 2.3 blocks. The Bullets improved to 39–43 but just missed the playoffs. , Washington, boasting the league's tallest player (Mureșan whose height is 7'7"), two very athletic forwards (Juwan and Webber) and one of the league's top point guards ( Rod Strickland ), struggled at the start of the 1996–97 season to a 22–24 start. That led to the dismissal of Head Coach Jim Lynam. Bernie Bickerstaff , an assistant coach with the Bullets when they won their only NBA Championship in 1978, was called upon to resurrect his former team. The Bullets responded, winning 16 of their final 21 games to finish 44–38, their best record since 1978–79. The late surge enabled the Bullets to climb within reach of the Cleveland Cavaliers for the final playoff spot. In a winner-take-the-eighth-playoff-spot game with the Cavaliers on the season's final day, the Bullets squeezed past Cleveland 85–81 to end the franchise's longest playoff drought. And while the Bullets were swept by the Bulls in the first round, they lost the three games by a total of just 18 points. , Webber led the way in scoring (20.1 ppg), rebounding (10.3) and blocks (1.9) and shot 51.8 percent from the floor to make his first All-Star team. Howard averaged 19.1 ppg and 8.0 rpg, while Strickland averaged 17.2 ppg and 1.74 spg and finished fifth in the league in assists with 8.9 per game. Muresan dominated the middle and led the NBA in field goal percentage (.599). Washington received contributions from Calbert Cheaney (10.6 ppg) and Tracy Murray (10.0 ppg). , In 1995, owner Abe Pollin announced he was changing the team's name because Bullets had acquired violent overtones that had made him increasingly uncomfortable over the years, particularly given the high homicide and crime rate in the early 1990s in Washington, D.C. It was widely believed to be related to the assassination of his longtime friend, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin .  A contest was held to choose a new name and the choices were narrowed to the Dragons , Express , Stallions , Sea Dogs , or Wizards .  On May 15, 1997, the Bullets officially became the Wizards. The change generated some controversy because Wizard is a rank in the Ku Klux Klan .  A new logo was unveiled and the team colors were changed from the traditional red, white and blue to a lighter shade of blue, black and bronze, the same colors as the Washington Capitals hockey team, also owned by Pollin. That same year the Wizards moved to the then MCI Center, now called Verizon Center . The Verizon Center is home to the Capitals, the Washington Mystics of the Women's National Basketball Association and the Georgetown Hoyas men's college basketball team. , In 1998, they became the brother team to the WNBA's Washington Mystics, and remained officially thus until 2005 when the Mystics were sold to Lincoln Holdings (headed by Ted Leonsis ), parent company of the Washington Capitals. However, upon the purchase of the Wizards by Leonsis in 2010, the Wizards and Mystics again became sibling teams. , The newly named Wizards began the 1997–98 season playing 5 home games at the Capital Centre before moving to the MCI Center on December 2, 1997. The Wizards finished the season with a 42–40 record including 4 straight victories to end the season but just missed the playoffs. Highlights of the season included Chris Webber leading the team in scoring (21.9 ppg) and rebounding (9.5 rpg). Strickland led the league in assists (10.5 apg) before suffering an injury near the end of the season. He was also named on the All-NBA Second Team. Tracy Murray averaged 15.1 ppg off the bench including a 50-point game against Golden State. Off court distractions led to the trade of Webber to the Sacramento Kings for Mitch Richmond and Otis Thorpe in May 1998. , The Wizards finished the lockout shortened season of 1998–99 with a record of 18–32. Mitch Richmond led the team in scoring with a 19.7 ppg average. In the 1999–2000 season , the Wizards finished with a 29–53 record. Mitch Richmond led the team with 17.4 ppg. In the 2000–2001 season , under newly hired coach Leonard Hamilton , 1999 NBA Draft pick Richard Hamilton led the team in scoring with 18.1 ppg, but the team finished with a 19–63 record (a franchise low). , On February 23, 2001, the Wizards were involved in a blockbuster trade days before the trading deadline. The team sent Juwan Howard , Obinna Ekezie and Calvin Booth to the Dallas Mavericks . In return, Washington received Hubert Davis , Courtney Alexander , Christian Laettner , Loy Vaught and Etan Thomas along with $3 million. , After retiring from the Chicago Bulls in early 1999, Michael Jordan became the Washington Wizards' president of basketball operations as well as a minority owner in January 2000. In September 2001, Jordan came out of retirement at age 38 to play for Washington. Jordan stated that he was returning "for the love of the game." Because of NBA rules, he had to divest himself of any ownership of the team. Before the All-Star break, Jordan was one of only two players to average more than 25 points, 5 assists, and 5 rebounds  as he led the Wizards to a 26–21 record. After the All-Star break, Jordan's knee could not handle the workload of a full-season as he ended the season on the injured list, and the Wizards concluded the season with a 37–45 record. Jordan led the Wizards to an 18-win improvement from the previous season. , Jordan announced he would return for the 2002–03 season , and this time he was determined to be equipped with reinforcements, as he traded for All-Star Jerry Stackhouse and signed budding star Larry Hughes . Jordan even accepted a sixth-man role on the bench in order for his knee to survive the rigors of an 82–game season. A combination of numerous team injuries and uninspired play led to Jordan's return to the starting lineup , where he tried to rebound the franchise from its early-season struggles. By the end of the season, the Wizards finished with a 37–45 record once again. Jordan ended the season as the only Wizard to play in all 82 games, as he averaged 20.0 points,  6.9 rebounds, 3.8 assists, and 1.5 steals in 37.0 minutes per game. , After the season, majority owner Pollin fired Jordan as team president, much to the shock of players, associates, and the public. Jordan felt betrayed, thinking that he would get his ownership back after his playing days ended, but Pollin justified Jordan's dismissal by noting that Jordan had detrimental effects on the team, such as benching Hughes for Tyronn Lue , making poor trades, and using the team's 2001 1st round draft pick on high schooler Kwame Brown . Without Jordan in the fold the following year, the Washington Wizards were not expected to win, and they did not. Despite the signing of future All-Star point guard Gilbert Arenas , in a move that was ironically made possible by Jordan's prior cap-clearing maneuvers as a team executive, the team stumbled to a 25–57 record in the 2003–04 season . , The Wizards replaced Jordan's managerial role with General Manager Ernie Grunfeld . , The 2004–05 NBA season saw the team (now in the new Southeast Division) post its best regular-season record in 26 years (45–37) and marked the first time the franchise had ever made the playoffs as the Wizards. In the off-season, the team traded Stackhouse, Christian Laettner , and the draft rights to Devin Harris to the Dallas Mavericks for Antawn Jamison . During the regular season, the scoring trio of Arenas, Jamison and Hughes was the highest in the NBA and earned the nickname of "The Big Three". Hughes led the NBA in steals with 2.89 per game. Arenas and Jamison were both named to the 2005 Eastern Conference All-Star team, marking the first time Washington had two players in the All-Star game since Jeff Malone and Moses Malone represented the Bullets in the 1987 All-Star Game. , With a 93–82 win over the Chicago Bulls on April 13, 2005, the Wizards clinched a playoff spot for the first time since 1996–97.  Long-suffering fans celebrated by buying over 16,000 playoff tickets in two and a half hours the day tickets went on sale.  In game 3 of the first round against the Bulls, the Wizards won their first playoff game since 1988.  Adding to the "long-overdue" feeling was the fact that game 3 was the first NBA playoff game to be held within Washington, D.C. city limits.  In the Wizards' game 5 victory in Chicago, Arenas hit a buzzer-beater to win the game  and the Wizards took their first lead in a playoff series since 1986. In Game 6 at the MCI Center, Jared Jeffries picked up a loose ball and went in for an uncontested tie-breaking dunk with 32 seconds left, thus giving the Wizards a 94–91 win and the team's first playoff series win in 23 years. They were only the 12th team in NBA history to win a playoff series after being down 0–2.  , In the conference semifinals, the Wizards were swept by the Miami Heat , the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference in the 2005 NBA Playoffs . , The 2005–06 NBA season was filled with ups and downs. During the off-season, Washington acquired Caron Butler and Antonio Daniels . During the regular season, the Wizards again had the best scoring trio in the NBA, this time consisting of Arenas, Jamison and Butler as the "Big Three". The Wizards started the 2005–06 season at 5–1, but went on an 8–17 funk to go to 13–18 through 31 games. Then, they went 13–5 in the next 18 games. On April 5, 2006, the team was 39–35 and looking to close in on the 45-win mark achieved the previous year, until Butler suffered a thumb sprain and the Wizards lost all five games without him. Butler returned and the team pulled out their final three games, against the Pistons, Cavs and Bucks, all playoff-bound teams, to finish the year at 42–40 and clinch the 5th seed in the Eastern Conference . They averaged 101.7 points a game, third in the NBA and tops in the East and clinched a playoff berth for the second year in a row for the first time since 1987. , Their first-round match-up with Cleveland was widely seen as the most evenly matched series in the 2006 NBA Playoffs . The teams exchanged wins during the first two games in Cleveland, with Game 2 highlighted by the Wizards holding LeBron James to 7–25 shooting from the floor while Brendan Haywood gave James a hard foul in the first quarter that many cited as the key to shaking up the rest of James's game. In Game 3 at the Verizon Center, James hit a 4-footer on the way down with 5.7 seconds left to take the game and the series lead for the Cavs with a 97–96 win. Arenas missed a potential game-winning three-pointer on the other end to seal the win for the Cavs. Game 4 saw the Wizards heat up again, as Arenas scored 20 in the fourth quarter after claiming he changed his jersey, shorts, shoes and tights in the room and the Wizards won 106–96. Yet in Games 5 and 6, the Cavs would take control of the series, both games decided by one point in overtime. , In Game 5, despite the Wizards being down 107–100 with 1:18 to play, the team drove back and eventually tied the game on Butler's layup with 7.5 seconds remaining to send the game to OT, where James scored with 0.9 seconds left in overtime to send the Cavs to a 121–120 win. The series returned to the Verizon Center for Game 6, where the game went back and forth all night. The Wizards blew a 14-point first-quarter lead, then for 24 minutes, from early in the second quarter to early in the fourth, neither team led by more than five points at any time. The Wizards blew a seven-point lead with just under 5 to play and needed Arenas to hit a 31-footer at the end of regulation to take the game to overtime. In OT, Arenas missed two key free throws. Cleveland rebounded the ball, went downcourt and Damon Jones hit a 17-foot baseline jumper with 4.8 seconds remaining to give the Cavs the lead for good. Butler missed a three-pointer on the other end to seal the game, and the series, for the Cavaliers. , The 2006–07 season started out very promisingly for the Wizards. In the off-season they signed free agents DeShawn Stevenson and Darius Songaila . Etan Thomas beat out Haywood for the starting center job. After starting the season 0–8 on the road, Washington rebounded to win 6 of 7 away from Verizon Center. After a November 4–9, Washington went 22–9 through December and January. Arenas scored a franchise-record 60 points against the Lakers on December 17. He and Eddie Jordan were named player of the month and coach of the month for December, respectively. On January 3 and again on January 15, Arenas hit buzzer-beating three-pointers to beat Milwaukee and Utah . , On January 30, Jamison went down with a sprained left knee in a win against Detroit . Washington went 4–8 in the 12 games without him. On February 3, Songaila made his Wizards debut against the Lakers. On February 18, Eddie Jordan became the first Wizards/Bullets coach to coach the NBA All-Star Game since Dick Motta in 1978–1979. Arenas played in his third straight All-Star game and Butler made his All-Star Game debut. , On March 14, Butler went out with a knee injury that kept him out of the lineup for six games. He returned for only three games until he fractured his right hand on April 1 against Milwaukee. On April 4, Arenas suffered a season-ending knee injury, of the meniscus. An April 15 article in The Washington Post pointed out that with Arenas and Butler gone, the team had lost 42.3% of their offensive production, quite possibly "the most costly" loss for any team in the midst of a playoff hunt in NBA history.  , Despite their late-season struggles without Arenas and Butler, the Wizards still managed to make the Eastern Conference playoffs, taking the 7th seed at 41–41. They were swept four games to none in a rematch of the previous year's first-round series against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Despite a depleted roster, the Wizards still managed to keep things close in every game in the series and only lost the final three games by a combined 20 points. The team enjoyed their best attendance figures in the post-Jordan era with a season attendance of 753,283 (18,372 per game).  , The Wizards retained a majority of their roster from the 2006–07 season, only losing Jarvis Hayes to Detroit , Calvin Booth to the Philadelphia 76ers , and Michael Ruffin to the Milwaukee Bucks as free agents. Washington signed Oleksiy Pecherov , the team's first-round pick in 2006, as well as 2007 picks Nick Young and Dominic McGuire . Etan Thomas missed the regular season after undergoing open-heart surgery. , The team began the season starting 0–5, but rebounded to win six straight. After 8 games, Arenas underwent surgery to repair a torn medial meniscus in his left knee, as well as a microfracture surgery. This was the same knee he had injured the previous year. The injury forced Arenas out for a total of 68 games. Midway through the season, Butler was forced to the sidelines for a total of 20 games with what initially was a strained hip flexor, but turned out to be a labral tear. Despite all of the injuries, the Wizards managed to go 43–39 on the regular season, good for 5th place in the Eastern Conference and a first-round playoff matchup with the Cleveland Cavaliers for the third straight season. , The Washington Wizards made minor modifications on their team jerseys and logos. To accommodate the gold–black alternate jerseys they introduced the previous season along with the design change on the Verizon Center floor, they changed their secondary team colors from bronze to metallic gold, and the player's name on the back of the jersey was changed from white/blue with bronze trim to gold (blue on home uniforms) with a change in lettering. , During the off-season, Arenas signed a six-year, $111 million contract, while Jamison signed a four-year, $50 million contract. The Wizards did not re-sign guard Roger Mason , who signed with the San Antonio Spurs . The Wizards added guards Dee Brown and Juan Dixon , and drafted JaVale McGee 18th overall  in the 2008 NBA Draft. , In September, Arenas underwent a third operation on his surgically repaired left knee to clean out fluid and debris, and was expected to miss at least the first month of the season. The forecast came in longer than expected, as Arenas missed five months of action due to concerns on his knee before returning on March 29, 2009. In the first game of the preseason, Jamison suffered a right knee contusion, and was expected to miss the rest of the preseason. Haywood announced that he would undergo surgery on his right wrist and was expected to miss four to six months. The preseason marked the return of Etan Thomas who had missed all of the 2007–2008 season while recovering from open heart surgery. The Wizards added guard Fenny Falmagne from the Dakota Wizards on August 23, 2008 that later was waived by the team after knee injury. , The Wizards opened the season on October 29 with a loss against New Jersey , and dropped 15 of their first 19 games. Head coach Eddie Jordan was fired on November 24 after a 1–10 start, and was replaced by interim coach Ed Tapscott . On December 10, Washington acquired guards Javaris Crittenton and Mike James in a three-team deal that sent Antonio Daniels to New Orleans . The team waived guard Dee Brown . They won just 14 of their first 60 games and in the end tied a franchise worst record of 19–63. , One of the few high points of the season came on February 27 when recently inaugurated President Barack Obama attended a Wizards game against the Chicago Bulls, sitting in a northeast court-side seat. The Wizards produced their second-biggest victory margin of the season with a 113–90 win; Jamison paced the side with 27 points. , On April 2, the Wizards shut down the Cleveland Cavaliers, who came in with a record of 61–13, and ended Cleveland's franchise-best winning streak at 13. , Flip Saunders reached an agreement to become the new coach of the team in mid-April, 2009.  Despite having the second best chance at obtaining the number one overall pick in the 2009 draft, the Wizards were randomly chosen to pick fifth overall in the NBA Draft Lottery.  This pick was later traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves , along with Songaila, Thomas, and Oleksiy Pecherov , in exchange for Randy Foye and Mike Miller .  On May 21, 2009, Wizards president Ernie Grunfeld announced that the team has named Randy Wittman and Sam Cassell as assistant coaches.  Then on August 11, 2009, the Wizards signed Fabricio Oberto , many weeks after he committed to signing with the team.  , In November, majority owner Abe Pollin died at the age of 85. At the time of his passing, he was the longest-tenured owner in NBA history.  Control of the franchise passed to his widow Irene, though minority owner Ted Leonsis was known to be preparing a takeover bid.  , On December 24, 2009, it was revealed that Arenas had admitted to storing unloaded firearms in his locker at Verizon Center and had surrendered them to team security. In doing so, Arenas violated both NBA rules against bringing firearms into an arena and D.C. ordinances.  On January 1, 2010, it was reported that Arenas and teammate Javaris Crittenton had unloaded guns in the Wizards' locker room during a Christmas Eve argument regarding gambling debts resulting in Arenas's suspension.  Despite Stern's longstanding practice of not disciplining players until the legal process plays out, he felt compelled to act when Arenas's teammates surrounded him during pregame introductions prior to a game with the Philadelphia 76ers and he pantomimed shooting them with guns made from his fingers.  The Wizards issued a statement condemning the players' pregame stunt as "unacceptable".  , On February 13, 2010, after a 17–33 record at the season's midway point, The Wizards traded Butler, Haywood, and Stevenson to the Mavericks in exchange for Josh Howard , Drew Gooden, Quinton Ross and James Singleton . Three days later, the Wizards traded Antawn Jamison to the Cavaliers in exchange for Zydrunas Ilgauskas and obtained Al Thornton from the Los Angeles Clippers in a three-team deal. Ilgauskas reported long enough to take a physical (to make the trade official). His contract was immediately bought out, making him a free agent. On February 26, 2010, the Wizards signed Shaun Livingston to a ten-day contract. With Gilbert Arenas suspended and Caron Butler and Antawn Jamison being traded, the Wizards finished the season at 26 wins and 56 losses, posting an abysmal 9–23 record to finish the season. They were the only Southeast Division team not to make the post-season. , Leonsis completed his takeover of the Wizards and Verizon Center in June (through Monumental Sports and Entertainment). He had previously purchased the Washington Capitals and Mystics from the Pollin family.  Leonsis has taken a fan-centric approach to running the franchise, by listening and responding to the concerns of Wizards supporters through his email and personal website.  He has written a manifesto of 101 changes he hopes to implement during his ownership, including changing the team's colors back to the red, white and blue of the Bullets era, and possibly changing the team nickname back to 'Bullets' as well.  Team President Ernie Grunfeld later confirmed that the franchise's colors would revert to red, white and blue from the 2011–12 season onwards, with the current uniform designs echoing the 1974 to 1987 striped set. Although the Wizards did not change their name to the Bullets again, they adopted a variation of the 1969 to 1987 Bullets logo with "wizards" spelled in all lowercase letters like the "bullets" logo was printed.  , Despite having only the 5th-best odds of obtaining the No. 1 pick (10.3% overall), the Wizards won the 2010 NBA Draft lottery and selected All-American Kentucky point guard John Wall with the first overall pick.  Later in the offseason, the team acquired the Chicago Bulls ' all-time leader in three-point field goals, Kirk Hinrich and the draft rights to forward Kevin Seraphin in exchange for the draft rights to Vladimir Veremeenko . , In a blockbuster trade, the Wizards sent Gilbert Arenas to the Orlando Magic in return for Rashard Lewis on December 18. Kirk Hinrich was traded to the Atlanta Hawks for Jordan Crawford , Maurice Evans , Mike Bibby , and a 2011 1st round pick that became Chris Singleton , although Mike Bibby bought out his contract after playing two games and eventually signed with the Miami Heat . The Wizards finished with a 23–59 record, once again occupying the Southeast Division cellar. , On May 10, the Wizards unveiled a new color scheme, uniforms and logo. David Safren, Pat Sullivan, and Michael Glazer were the product designers for the new jerseys which include the Washington Monument as an alternate logo. The team of product designers was led by Jessie Caples, who made most of the design decisions. James Pinder was also an essential part of the team as he helped to engineer the jerseys to meet the players' standards. The team reverted to its traditional red, white and blue colors. The uniforms are based very closely on those worn from 1974 to 1987, during the team's glory years. Leonsis said the throwback to the old Bullets' uniforms was intentional; the only difference between those uniforms and the current ones is the team name on the jerseys. The colors were also used by Leonsis' other franchises, the Capitals and the Mystics, who adopted to those colors in 2007 and 2011, respectively.  , The Wizards' first season with their new look was an eventful one. After a poor start to the season, head coach Flip Saunders was fired and replaced by assistant Randy Wittman .  On March 15, the Wizards were involved in a three way trade that sent JaVale McGee and Ronny Turiaf to the Nuggets and Nick Young to the Clippers in exchange for Nenê and Brian Cook . After ending the season on a six-game win streak, the Wizards finished with a record of 20-46 (season was shortened due to the 2011 NBA Lockout ) and the second worst record in the NBA, comfortably ahead of the 7-59 Charlotte Bobcats who set a new NBA record for the lowest win percentage in a season with .106. , The Wizards sent Rashard Lewis and a pick to the Hornets for Emeka Okafor and Trevor Ariza . , In the 2012 NBA Draft, the Wizards selected Bradley Beal and Tomáš Satoranský . , On July 17, 2012, the Wizards exercised the amnesty provision from the 2011 CBA to release Andray Blatche .  They also signed A. J. Price . Then, on August 29, 2012, Martell Webster was signed to the Wizards for one year on a $1.6 million contract. He played above average for what he was signed for and had a .422 average for three-pointers and a .442 field goal percentage. , On April 30, 2013. Jason Collins , who joined the team in February announced his homosexuality as a member of the Wizards. His announcement made him the first openly gay member of a North American team sport. , On Tuesday, May 21, 2013 the Wizards jumped up 5 spots in the NBA Draft Lottery to make the number 3 overall selection for the second year in a row.  They used that pick to draft Consensus All-American Otto Porter of Georgetown University .  , On October 25, 2013, the Wizards' center Emeka Okafor and top-12 protected 2014 first-round pick were traded to the Phoenix Suns for the center Marcin Gortat , Shannon Brown , Malcolm Lee and Kendall Marshall .  , On February 3, 2014, the Wizards defeated the Portland Trail Blazers to improve to a 24-23 record. The win marked the first time the team had held a winning record since 2009.  , On April 2, 2014, the Wizards defeated the Boston Celtics by a score of 118-92 to clinch the team's first playoff berth since the 2007-08 season.  , On April 29, 2014, the Wizards defeated the Chicago Bulls in game 5 of the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals by a score of 75-69 to win the series 4-1. This was the Wizards first series victory since the 2005 NBA Playoffs when they defeated the same team in 6 games.  , The Wizards advanced to the Eastern Conference Semi Finals against the Indiana Pacers. The Wizards won game one 102-96. In game two the Wizards lost a 19-point second half lead, as they dropped the game 88-82. After being routed by Indiana in game three 85-63, they also lost game four 95-92. They showed grit and determination as they staved off elimination with a 102-79 game five win. They were behind most of game 6, but battled back to take the lead late in the game. However, Indiana closed out the series with a 93-80 win. , On November 12, 2014, the Wizards defeated the Detroit Pistons 107-103, extending their record to 6-2 for the first time since the 1975–76 season.  The following game three days later, the Wizards defeated the Orlando Magic 98-93 as they won their third straight and moved to 7-2, their best start since opening 7-1 during the 1974–75 season.  With a 104-96 win over the Los Angeles Clippers on December 12, the Wizards moved to an 11-2 record at home to start the season for the first time in franchise history.  They would struggle throughout the later months of the season but the Washington Wizards would finish the season with a 46-36 record, their best record since the 1978-1979 season. They played the Toronto Raptors in the first round of the NBA Playoffs and won in four games, marking their first sweep in franchise history. Following the victory over Toronto, the Wizards next had to play the top seeded Atlanta Hawks. The Wizards managed to take the first game in the series, but suffered the loss of Wall due to a fractured wrist. Although SF Paul Pierce made several big shots throughout the series, the loss of Wall proved too much, and Atlanta took the series in six games. , The following players have rights owned by the Washington Wizards. , The Washington Hall of Stars, a series of banners on the right-field wall of Robert F. Kennedy Stadium in Washington, honors several D.C. sports heroes. The Bullets/Wizards figures honored are: , The Hall honors Arnold "Red" Auerbach , who played collegiately at D.C.'s George Washington University , and Horace "Bones" McKinney , who played for the Washington Capitols in the early days of the NBA. Both men coached the Capitols, who played from the NBA's founding in 1946 until the team folded in 1951. , * Active (through 2009–2010 regular season) , NBA Most Valuable Player , NBA Finals MVP , NBA Rookie of the Year , NBA Most Improved Player , NBA Coach of the Year , NBA Executive of the Year , All-NBA First Team , All-NBA Second Team , All-NBA Third Team , NBA All-Defensive First Team , NBA All-Defensive Second Team , NBA All-Rookie First Team , NBA All-Rookie Second Team , NBA All-Star Game , * Starter , Long Distance Shootout , Slam Dunk Contest , Skills Challenge , Rookie Challenge  The Denver Nuggets are a professional basketball team based in Denver , Colorado . The Nuggets are a member of the Northwest Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The team was founded as the Denver Larks in 1967 as a charter franchise of the American Basketball Association (ABA) but changed its name to Rockets before the first season.  It changed its name again to the Nuggets in 1974, and played for the final ABA Championship title in 1976, losing to the New York Nets . , The team joined the NBA in 1976 after the ABA–NBA merger and has had some periods of success, qualifying for the playoffs in nine consecutive seasons in the 1980s and doing the same for the previous ten seasons. However, it has not made an appearance in a championship round since its last year in the ABA. The Nuggets play their home games at the Pepsi Center , which they share with the Colorado Avalanche of the National Hockey League (NHL). , , , In 1967, one of the ABA's charter franchises was awarded to a group in Kansas City, Missouri , headed by Southern Californian businessman James Trindle. However, Trindle was unable to find a suitable arena in the Kansas City area. League commissioner George Mikan suggested moving the team to Denver. After agreeing to name Denver native and former NBA player Vince Boryla as general manager, Trindle moved his team to Denver as the Denver Larks, named after Colorado's state bird.  The Trindle group was severely undercapitalized, leading Mikan to order the Larks to post a $100,000 performance bond or lose the franchise. Hours before the deadline, Trindle sold a two-thirds controlling interest to Denver trucking magnate Bill Ringsby for $350,000. Ringsby then renamed the team the Rockets, after his company's long-haul trucks.  , Playing at the Denver Auditorium Arena , the Rockets had early successes on the court, developing a solid fan base along the way.  However, the team had a history of early playoff exits and failed to play in an ABA championship series. , Early, they had a solid lineup led by Byron Beck and Larry Jones , then later by Beck and Ralph Simpson . Lonnie Wright of the American Football League 's Denver Broncos signed with the Rockets during that first season and became the first player to play professional football and basketball in the same season. Wright played four seasons with Denver.  Controversial rookie Spencer Haywood joined the team for the 1969–70 season. Haywood was one of the first players to turn pro before graduating from college, and the NBA initially refused to let him play in the league. Haywood averaged nearly 30 points and 19.5 rebounds per game in his only ABA season, being named ABA MVP, ABA rookie of the year, as well as the All-Star Game MVP. The team finished 51-33, winning their division, before exiting the playoffs in the 2nd round. , Just before the start of the 1970-71 season, Haywood signed with the Seattle SuperSonics , jumping to the NBA. The team tumbled to a 30-54 record and attendance suffered.  , Ringsby sold the team to San Diego businessmen Frank Goldberg and Bud Fischer in 1972.  In 1974, in anticipation of moving into the NBA , and the new McNichols Arena , the franchise held a contest to choose a new team nickname, as "Rockets" was already in use by the Houston Rockets . The winning choice was "Nuggets," in honor of the original Nuggets team in Denver from 1948–50, the last year as a charter member of the NBA. Their new logo was a miner "discovering" an ABA ball. Goldberg and Fischer in turn sold the team to a local investment group in 1976. , With the drafting and signing of future hall of fame player David Thompson out of North Carolina State , Marvin Webster and the acquisitions of Dan Issel and Bobby Jones and with Larry Brown coaching, they had their best seasons in team history in their first two seasons as the Nuggets. Playing in the Denver Auditorium Arena for the last season the 1974-75 team went 65-16, including a 40-2 record at home. However, a quick playoff exit followed.  , In 1975-76, playing at their new arena, the Nuggets edged the reigning champion Kentucky Colonels four games to three to make the 1976 ABA finals for the first time. Eventually, they lost to the New York Nets and Julius Erving .  They did not get a second chance to win an ABA league championship, as the ABA-NBA merger took place after the 1975–76 season. The Nuggets, Nets, Indiana Pacers and San Antonio Spurs were merged into the NBA. The Spirits of St. Louis and Kentucky Colonels were disbanded.  , The Nuggets and Nets had actually applied to join the NBA in 1975, but were forced to stay in the ABA by a court order. The Nuggets continued their strong play early on in the NBA, as they won division titles in their first two seasons in the league, and missed a third by a single game. However, neither of these teams were ultimately successful in the postseason. Similarly to the other new NBA teams, the Nuggets were given many financial issues including a 2 million dollar entry fee. Red McCombs bought the team in 1978. , In 1979, Brown left the team, helping usher in a brief decline in their team's performance. It ended in 1981, when they hired Doug Moe as a head coach. Moe brought with him a "motion offense" philosophy, a style of play focusing on attempting to move the ball until someone got open. Moe was also known for not paying as much attention to defense as his colleagues. The offense helped the team become highly competitive. During the 1980s, the Nuggets often [ quantify ] scored in excess of 115 points a game, and during the 1981–82 season, they scored at least 100 points in every game—136 consecutive games (NBA record).  During the 1981–82 season, the Nuggets set the league scoring record for the highest points per game average at 126.5 points. , Anchored by scoring machines Alex English and Kiki Vandeweghe at the two forward spots, and Dan Issel at center, Denver led the league in scoring, with English and Vandeweghe both averaging above 25 points per game. It was a novel strategy, allowing the Nuggets to top the Midwest Division and qualify for the playoffs during that span. (On December 13, 1983, the Nuggets and the visiting Detroit Pistons combined for an NBA record 370 points, with Detroit winning in triple overtime , 186–184.) At the end of the season, English won the NBA scoring title, becoming the only Nugget to win the award despite the heavily favored offensive play of Doug Moe. In 1984–85 , they made it to the Western Conference finals after being perennial playoff contenders, and they lost in 5 games to the Los Angeles Lakers . , Vandeweghe was traded before the 1984–85 season to the Portland Trail Blazers for 6–3 rebounding guard Fat Lever , undersized power forward Calvin Natt and center Wayne Cooper . Spearheaded by Alex English and supported by the three new acquisitions and defensive specialists Bill Hanzlik and TR Dunn , the team replicated its success in the Western Conference despite the loss of Vandeweghe. They even managed to win 54 games in the 1987–88 season , the most they had ever won as an NBA team. However, the Mavericks eliminated the Nuggets in the second round of the 1988 NBA Playoffs. McCombs sold the team to Sidney Shlenker in 1985. Shlenker, in turn, sold the team to COMSAT in 1989. , Moe left the team in 1990, and was replaced by Paul Westhead . Westhead also believed in a " run and gun " style of play, and gave the green light for players like Michael Adams and Chris Jackson to light up the scoreboards within seconds of possession. , However, Westhead cared even less about defense than Moe. As a result, the Nuggets gave up points so quickly that even their prolific offense couldn't keep up. They finished with the worst record in the league during the 1990–91 season, despite setting many scoring records. As an insult, many sportswriters nicknamed the team at the time as the "Enver Nuggets" (as in no "D", or no defense). , Denver took a positive step in rebuilding by drafting 7–2 Georgetown University center Dikembe Mutombo in 1991. Mutombo finished runner-up to Larry Johnson for the NBA rookie of the year that season. Denver finished 24–58 that year. , Denver fired Westhead prior to the 1992–93 season and hired former star player Dan Issel as his successor. The Nuggets had two lottery picks that year and drafted University of Notre Dame forward LaPhonso Ellis and University of Virginia guard Bryant Stith . Denver improved to 36–46, just missing the playoffs that year. , Denver ditched their rainbow colors for a dark navy, metallic gold and wine color scheme starting in the 1993–94 season. Led by Mutombo, Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf (who changed his name from Chris Jackson prior to the season), and Ellis, Denver finished with its first winning season since the Doug Moe era at 42–40. Denver clinched the 8th seed in the Western Conference playoffs, playing the first place Seattle SuperSonics . Denver was a heavy underdog, having only a couple of players on their roster with actual NBA playoff experience. After dropping the first two games of the five-game set in Seattle , the series returned to Denver. Denver won both games and tied the series at 2. The Nuggets made NBA history in Game 5, upsetting Seattle in overtime 98–94. They became the first 8th-seeded team to defeat a 1st-seeded team in NBA playoff history. Denver almost repeated the feat before falling to the Utah Jazz in Game 7 of the second round. , Denver acquired Sonics sharp-shooter Dale Ellis in the off-season and drafted University of Michigan guard Jalen Rose . Denver struggled, causing Issel to resign as coach partway into the season. Assistant Coach Gene Littles assumed control for a brief period before relinquishing control to general manager Bernie Bickerstaff . Denver rebounded and earned the 8th seed again in the playoffs, finishing 41–41. The Nuggets were swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the playoffs that season. , Following that season, Denver acquired Antonio McDyess in a draft day trade with the Los Angeles Clippers . McDyess was the face of the franchise for the next few years, as Mutombo left after the 1995–96 season for the Atlanta Hawks , Ellis missed the majority of the next few seasons due to recurring knee and leg injuries, Rose was traded to the Indiana Pacers for Mark Jackson , and Abdul-Rauf was traded to the Sacramento Kings prior to the 1996–97 season. , After finishing the 1996-97 season with the fourth worst record in the league (21-61), the Nuggets sent Antonio McDyess to the Phoenix Suns , and Dale Ellis returned to Seattle. Denver flirted with history in the 1997–98 , by nearly setting the mark for fewest wins in an 82-game season (11). They tied the then-NBA's all-time worst single-season losing streak at 23 —only one game shy of the overall worst mark of 24 by the Cleveland Cavaliers of the early 1980s. The losing streak was later broken by the Cavaliers in 2011 and the Philadelphia 76ers in 2014 with 26 consecutive losses. Several years later, the Nuggets tied for the worst record in the NBA in 2002–03 , also with the Cavaliers. , The team's struggles in the late 1990s were due in part to ownership instability. COMSAT bought the NHL 's Quebec Nordiques in 1995 and moved them to Denver as the Colorado Avalanche . However, its diversification into sports ownership was proving a drain on the company. In particular, cost overruns associated with the construction of Pepsi Center had shareholders up in arms. Finally, in 1997, COMSAT agreed in principle to sell Ascent Entertainment Group, the umbrella corporation for its sporting assets, to Liberty Media .  However, Liberty was not interested in sports ownership at the time (though it has since bought the Atlanta Braves ), and made the deal contingent upon Ascent selling the Avalanche and Nuggets.  , After almost two years, Ascent sold the Avalanche and Nuggets to Walmart heirs Bill and Nancy Laurie for $400 million. However, a group of Ascent shareholders sued, claiming that the sale price was several million dollars too low. Ascent then agreed to sell the Avalanche and Nuggets to Denver banking tycoon Donald Sturm for $461 million.  , However, a new wrinkle appeared when the city of Denver refused to transfer the parcel of land on which Pepsi Center stood unless Sturm promised to keep the Avalanche and Nuggets in Denver for at least 25 years. Sturm had bought the teams in his own name, and the city wanted to protect itself in case Sturm either died or sold the teams before the 25 years ran out. While Sturm was willing to make a long-term commitment to the city, he wasn't willing to be held responsible if he died or sold the teams. After negotiations fell apart, Liberty bought all of Ascent, but kept the Nuggets and Avalanche on the market.  In the meantime, Issel had returned as head coach in 1999, but the protracted ownership negotiations made it difficult for him to rebuild the team. Just before the start of the 1999–2000 season, he told reporters there were several personnel moves he simply couldn't make due to the unstable ownership situation (since all basketball decisions required the approval of both Ascent/Liberty and Sturm).  , Finally, in July 2000, the Avalanche, Nuggets and Pepsi Center were bought by real estate entrepreneur Stan Kroenke in a $450 million deal.  Kroenke is the brother-in-law of the Lauries; his wife Ann is Nancy Laurie's sister. Liberty retained only a 6.5% stake of the sports franchises. As part of the deal, Kroenke placed the teams into a trust that would ensure the teams will stay in Denver until at least 2025.  After the deal, Kroenke organized his sports assets under Kroenke Sports Enterprises. , In 2003 , the Nuggets drafted future All-Star Carmelo Anthony with the third overall pick in the 2003 NBA Draft .  That same year, the team also updated their logos and uniforms, with a new color scheme of powder blue, gold and royal blue; the latter color was changed to navy blue in 2009.  In just two months of the season, the Nuggets recorded more wins than they had in 5½ months of play in 2002–03. Much of the reason for this incredible turnaround were the front-office moves of General Manager Kiki Vandeweghe , a former Nuggets player who assumed General Manager duties on August 9, 2001.  In April, the turnaround was complete as they became the first franchise in NBA history to qualify for the postseason following a sub-20-win campaign the previous year since the NBA went to an 82-game schedule.  They were eliminated in the first round 4 games to 1 by the Minnesota Timberwolves .  , On December 28, 2004, head coach Jeff Bzdelik was fired from the organization and replaced by interim coach, former Los Angeles Laker player and Los Angeles Sparks head coach Michael Cooper .  The Nuggets later hired George Karl as a permanent replacement.  Karl led the team to a record of 32–8 in the second half of the regular season, which vaulted the team into the playoffs for the second consecutive year.  , In the playoffs , however, the Nuggets could not survive the San Antonio Spurs . After winning game one in San Antonio , the Nuggets proceeded to lose the next four games and lost the series 4–1.  The Nuggets picked 20th in the 2005 NBA Draft ; it was acquired from the Washington Wizards via the Orlando Magic .  Denver selected Julius Hodge with the pick. The Nuggets also had the 22nd overall selection in the draft, in which they selected Jarrett Jack , but sent him to the Portland Trail Blazers for rights to Portland's 27th overall pick, Linas Kleiza .  , In 2005–06 , for the first time in 18 years, the club won the Northwest division title.  This placed the team in the third seed of the Western Conference playoffs . Denver played the Los Angeles Clippers who, despite their 6th seeding, had a better regular-season record. As a result, the Clippers received home court advantage. They defeated the Nuggets in 5 games. Shortly after, the Nuggets announced that General Manager Kiki Vandeweghe's contract would not be renewed. He was replaced by Mark Warkentien .  , On December 18, 2006, team co-captain Carmelo Anthony , shooting guard J.R. Smith and power forward Nenê were suspended by the NBA (15, 10 and one games respectively) for a fight that occurred in the last two minutes of a game against the New York Knicks two days earlier.   The fight was sparked by Knicks rookie Mardy Collins , when he tackled J.R. Smith on a breakaway layup. According to Anthony, Knicks coach Isiah Thomas warned him to not go in the paint shortly before the hard foul.  , On December 19, 2006, the Nuggets traded Joe Smith , Andre Miller and two first-round draft picks of the 2007 NBA Draft to the Philadelphia 76ers for Ivan McFarlin and superstar Allen Iverson (McFarlin was waived immediately following the trade's approval). The moves gave the Nuggets the top two scorers in the league at the time in Anthony and Iverson, who were both scoring over 30 points per game at the time of the trade. On January 11, 2007, Earl Boykins , Julius Hodge and cash considerations were traded to the Milwaukee Bucks , in exchange for point guard Steve Blake . With Iverson, many considered the Nuggets as one of the elite in the West. However, chemistry was an issue, as the Nuggets finished the season with the 6 seed, giving them a first round matchup against the San Antonio Spurs . In the playoffs , the Nuggets took Game 1 and home court advantage away from the Spurs. However, in an eerie repeat of the 2005 playoffs, the Spurs bounced back to sweep the next four, as the Nuggets were eliminated in the first round in five games for the fourth straight year. , On March 16, 2008 , the Nuggets scored 168 points in a 168–116 home win over Seattle SuperSonics .  It was the third-most points scored for a regulation game in NBA history (The Nuggets and the Pistons hold the spot for most combined points scored in a game which was over 360 points total.)  , They finished the 2007–08 NBA season with exactly 50 wins as well as finishing the first half of that season 25–16 (50–32 overall record, tied for the third-best all-time Nuggets record since the team officially joined the NBA in 1976), following a 120–111 home victory over the Memphis Grizzlies in the last game of the season.  It was the first time since the 1987–88 NBA season that the Nuggets finished with at least 50 wins in a season.  Denver ended up as the 8th seed in the Western Conference of the 2008 NBA Playoffs , and their 50 wins marked the highest win total for an 8th seed in NBA history.  It also meant that for the first time in NBA history, all eight playoff seeds in a Conference had at least 50 wins. The Nuggets faced the top-seeded Los Angeles Lakers (57–25) in the first round. The seven games separating the Nuggets and the Lakers overall records is the closest margin between an eighth seed and a top seed since the NBA went to a 16-team playoff format in 1983–84 .  However, the Lakers swept them in four games, marking the second time in NBA history that a 50-win team was swept in a best-of-seven playoff series in the first round. It was Denver's fifth straight first-round loss.   , On July 16, 2008, at the end of the 2007–08 NBA season , the Nuggets traded former NBA Defensive Player of the Year Marcus Camby to the Los Angeles Clippers for a second-round draft pick (that was then traded to the New York Knicks for Renaldo Balkman ). This trade was to reduce the Nuggets' payroll costs. [ citation needed ] , On November 3, 2008, guard Allen Iverson was traded to the Detroit Pistons for Chauncey Billups , Antonio McDyess , and Cheikh Samb (part of the trade exception from the Marcus Camby trade was used to allow the deal to go through). McDyess was waived though on November 10, 2008, and he returned to Detroit shortly afterwards. , With Carmelo Anthony averaging 22.8 ppg and Billups averaging 6.4 assists in the 2008–09 NBA season the Nuggets accomplished a great number of franchise milestones. Their 54–28 record matched the most wins the franchise had gotten since their induction in the NBA; their 27–14 start was also a record for wins in the first half of a season. This also marked the first time in the franchise's history the team had back-to-back 50-win seasons. They led the Northwest division for much of the season, eventually winning the division and placing #2 in the Western Conference, matching the highest the team has ever been seeded for the playoffs. General Manager Mark Warkentien won the NBA Executive of the Year Award for the Nuggets' improvement. They won Game 1 of the playoffs in a blowout victory against the New Orleans Hornets , the first time they had home-court advantage since 1988 and also, the 29-point victory was the largest victory for any team for Game 1 of the first round of the 2009 NBA Playoffs . Chauncey Billups set a Nuggets franchise record with the most three-pointers in a playoff game with 8, and his 19 three-pointers in total is also a Nuggets record for threes made in a playoff series.   They went on to beat the Hornets in 5, including a 58-point victory in Game 4 which matched the most lopsided win in NBA playoff history . They then went on to beat the 6th seed Dallas Mavericks 4 games to 1 in the Conference Semifinals to make their first trip to the Western Conference Finals since 1985 . That was also the first time the Nuggets had ever led 3–0 in a best-of-seven series. Up to that point, they held an NBA Playoffs-high in three-pointers made and a 16-point average margin of victory, the largest average margin of victory in the first 10 playoff games in NBA Playoff history. They lost the first game of the Western Conference Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers but won the second game to tie the series. Anthony became the first Denver player to score at least 30 points in five consecutive playoff games since the Nuggets joined the NBA in 1976. They lost the series 4–2, ending Denver's longest playoff run in team history.  , In the 2009 NBA Draft , the Nuggets traded a first-round draft pick acquired from the Charlotte Bobcats to the Minnesota Timberwolves for the rights to rookie Ty Lawson , who was drafted 18th overall. On July 13, 2009, the Nuggets traded a second-round draft pick to the Detroit Pistons for Arron Afflalo (part of the trade exception from the Iverson trade was used to allow the deal to go through) and Walter Sharpe . Afflalo replaced starting guard Dahntay Jones , who signed with the Indiana Pacers .  However, on August 10, the Nuggets lost forward Linas Kleiza , who signed with Olympiacos Piraeus of the Greek League .  , The 2009–10 season saw Anthony average 28.2 ppg and Billups average a career-high 19.6 ppg. In the opening two games of the season, Anthony totaled 71 points, scoring 30 points in the home opener and 41 the next night, in wins against division rivals Utah Jazz and Portland Trail Blazers , respectively. Anthony became one of two players in the Nuggets' history to open with more than 70 points through two games (Alex English also accomplished the feat). It was also only the second time since 1987 that the Nuggets started the season 2–0.  They later went 3–0, 4–0, and 5–0 for the first time since 1985 after defeating the Memphis Grizzlies , Indiana Pacers , and New Jersey Nets respectively. Despite injuries which caused all three captains – Carmelo Anthony, Chauncey Billups, and Kenyon Martin  – to miss a total of 46 games, and then later on in the second half of the season the absence of head coach George Karl , who underwent treatment for neck and throat cancer , the Nuggets were still able to win 53 games (third consecutive 50-win season, a Nuggets first) for the season which gave them a second consecutive Northwest division title and finished as the fourth seed in the West Conference. However, they were eliminated by the Utah Jazz 4-2, their sixth first-round elimination in 7 seasons. Anthony averaged a career-high 30.7 ppg in the playoffs. , On July 14, 2010, the Nuggets bolstered their frontcourt depth by signing Al Harrington .  During the 2010 off-season, Masai Ujiri replaced Mark Warkentien as the General Manager, while Josh Kroenke was named team president. , Stan Kroenke bought full ownership in the St. Louis Rams of the NFL in 2010. Since the NFL does not allow its owners to hold majority control of major-league teams in other NFL cities, Kroenke turned over day-to-day control of the Nuggets and Avalanche to Josh Kroenke toward the end of 2010, and must sell his controlling interest in both teams by 2014.  , On February 22, 2011, after months of speculation that he wanted to leave the Nuggets, Carmelo Anthony was traded along with Chauncey Billups , Anthony Carter , Shelden Williams and Renaldo Balkman to the New York Knicks in a multi-player deal also involving the Minnesota Timberwolves in which the Nuggets received Wilson Chandler , Raymond Felton , Danilo Gallinari , Timofey Mozgov and Kosta Koufos . On the day when the trade was done, the Nuggets were left with 9 players to play against the Memphis Grizzlies . The Nuggets won 120–107, where they led by as many as 27 points. In the closing minutes of the game, the arena resounded with chants of "Who needs Melo?" George Karl said after the game, "Our guys, when their backs are confronted with a difficult situation, they usually play at a high level. We always react to tough situations in a very positive way." Some people [ who? ] said after the trade the Nuggets would become the " Cleveland Cavaliers " of the West, that is, falter in the standings and lose their playoff hopes due to the loss of their franchise player, Carmelo. However, the trade only seemed to make them better. Post-trade, the Nuggets averaged 24.1 assists, showing their newfound teamwork. The defense of the Nuggets also improved, from allowing 105.2 ppg before the trade to of 97.1 ppg for the remainder of the season.  Despite the franchise changing trade which saw eighteen different starting lineups through the whole season, Denver finished with 50 wins (fourth consecutive 50 win seasons for the first time in Nuggets history), clinching the 5th seed of the Western Conference. They met the Oklahoma City Thunder in the first round of the playoffs and lost four games to one. , The first full season of the post-Melo Nuggets saw the steady rise of Danilo Gallinari, who averaged 17 points, 5.2 rebounds and 2.6 assists through the first 25 games of the season, which resulted to the Nuggets' best start through the first 20 games. But Gallinari was robbed off his best season by injuries to his ankle, thumb, and wrist. On March 15, 2012, the Nuggets decided to make their team younger by trading Nenê , who had played the previous 9 seasons for Denver, to the Washington Wizards for JaVale McGee .  Prior to playing with the Nuggets, McGee has had the reputation as a dumb NBA player, known for making awful mistakes that have molded his losing years playing for the Washington Wizards. McGee had a rebirth in Denver though, as he changed from a knucklehead to a key player for the Nuggets. [ neutrality is disputed ] In his first game as a Nugget, he made a putback dunk off an Arron Afflalo miss which proved to be the game-winning basket in Denver's 116-115 victory over the Detroit Pistons. In two of the Nuggets final games of their season, McGee finally earned national attention when he had a 16-point,15-rebound effort, and a 21-point, 14-rebound effort in Denver's playoff series against the Los Angeles Lakers . These performances helped the Nuggets come back from a 2-0 and a 3-1 series deficit, but the Nuggets eventually lost in Game 7, 87-96. , On August 10, 2012, Denver was involved in a four-team trade where they received All-Star Andre Iguodala and sent Arron Afflalo and Al Harrington to the Orlando Magic . This same trade also sent Dwight Howard to the Los Angeles Lakers . After the trade, Iguodala tweeted "I'm excited to be joining the Denver Nuggets and I know my best basketball is ahead of me!"  Despite losing their first three games, the 2012-2013 Nuggets finished with a franchise best 57-25 record, and a 38-3 record in Pepsi Center (the Washington Wizards, Miami Heat , and Minnesota Timberwolves were the only 3 visitors to defeat Denver on their home during the regular season).Denver also clinched the 3rd seed in the Western Conference, with a first round matchup with the Golden State Warriors . The Nuggets won Game 1 97-95 on their home court on a last second Andre Miller game winner, but the Warriors won the next three games, putting the Nuggets on the brink of elimination. Denver won Game 5 at home to keep their season alive, but the Warriors eliminated the Nuggets in Game 6, winning 88-92 in Oakland. It was Denver's ninth first round loss in the previous 10 seasons, and the eighth of Karl's tenure. Although Karl won that year's NBA Coach of the Year Award and had led Denver to the playoffs in every year of his nine-year tenure, it wasn't enough to keep him from being fired after the season. , Along with Karl being fired, Denver saw a major shake-up in the front office with Executive of the Year Masai Ujiri accepting the general manager position with the Toronto Raptors  and vice-president Pete D'Alessandro , who was expected to replace Ujiri, being named General Manager of the Sacramento Kings . On June 21, 2013, Tim Connelly was announced as the new general manager.  and to replace Karl, the Nuggets hired the Indiana Pacers' associate head coach, former NBA player, Brian Shaw . Guard-forward Andre Iguodala was sent to the Golden State Warriors in a sign-and-trade in which they acquired guard Randy Foye from the Utah Jazz. They also signed center-forward J. J. Hickson , who was previously with the Portland Trail Blazers and 5' 9" guard Nate Robinson , who played for the Bulls during the 2012–2013 season. They also acquired Darrell Arthur from the Memphis Grizzlies and 55th pick Joffrey Lauvergne in return for Kosta Koufos.  In a tough 2013-14 season which saw numerous injuries to key players missing a significant amount of the season, the Nuggets finished with 36 wins, their worst in 11 years, and missed the playoffs. , During the 2014 offseason, the Nuggets brought back Arron Afflalo who they traded Evan Fournier for. Denver also traded their first lottery pick (#12) since 2003 to Chicago to acquire two later first round draft picks, which were used to draft Jusuf Nurkić and Gary Harris . On March 3, 2015 general manager Tim Connelly announced the Nuggets fired head coach Brian Shaw and named Melvin Hunt interim head coach.  , On June 15, 2015, Michael Malone was named as the new head coach of the Denver Nuggets.  , The Nuggets have worn numerous uniforms throughout their franchise history, including their days in the American Basketball Association as the "Denver Rockets." From the early to mid-1970s, the Nuggets wore gold and purple (Columbine blue) uniforms. , When the Nuggets joined the NBA in the 1976–77 season, they retained the pick-axe logo on their jerseys from the ABA days. The home uniforms feature 'Nuggets' in red with a red pick-axe inside a blue oval, and gold numbers with blue trim in front, blue numbers and letters at the back. The road uniforms were blue, with 'Denver' in blue with a blue pick-axe in a red oval, and gold numbers in front, white numbers and letters at the back. , The Nuggets simplified their uniforms following their inaugural season in the NBA. From 1977–82, their home uniforms were white, with a "Nuggets" script written across the chest in a darker royal blue, with gold trim around the script and jersey numbers. The royal blue away jersey had "Denver" written across the chest in white, with gold trim. , From the early-1980s until the 1992–93 season, the Nuggets wore the Denver "rainbow city" skyline across the chest and back on both the home and away uniforms. Some fans also call the iconic 1980s logo the " Tetris " logo, due to the buildings that shadow the mountains on the logo which are in the shape of squares. The initial home uniforms were white with navy and green trim, with "Nuggets" and the uniform number in gold with blue trim. The player names were written in block lettering and in a straight position. In 1985, they changed the shade of blue to royal and eliminated green, and in 1986, changed the back numbers to royal blue. In 1991, coinciding with the debut of Dikembe Mutombo , the word "Nuggets" became white with royal blue and gold trim. The road uniforms were initially navy blue with green trim, with "Denver" and the uniform number in white with gold trim, before likewise changing it to royal blue, with gold serifed block letters for player names in an arch (royal blue in home uniforms). , For the 1993–94 season, the Nuggets drastically changed their look, with a navy blue, gold and wine color scheme on their uniforms. The home jerseys had a "Nuggets" script in a modified version of the typeface Aachen across the chest in navy blue, with dark red and gold trim around the script and numbers, while the navy blue away jerseys had the same script in gold, with dark red and white trim. The Nuggets wore these uniforms for a decade, until the 2002–03 season. , For the 2003–04 season, the Nuggets made another uniform change, coinciding with Carmelo Anthony 's debut with a new color scheme of powder blue, royal blue and gold. Like the 1990s uniforms, the new Nuggets jerseys also have the Aachen typeface across the chest — it's "Nuggets" in powder blue, with royal blue and gold trim on the home white jersey, while the new powder blue road jersey has "Denver" in white, with gold and royal blue trim. These jerseys were tweaked prior to the 2008–09 season, with the royal blue trim replaced by navy blue, as well as a circle patch of the Nuggets alternate pick axe logo placed above the nameplate on the backs of the jerseys. , In the 2005–06 season, the Nuggets also introduced an alternate navy blue uniform, with an alternate Nuggets script in gold, with navy blue interior trim and powder blue outlining. This uniform was used until the end of the 2011–12 season. , For the 2012–13 season, the Nuggets unveiled a new gold alternate jersey, replacing the aforementioned navy blue jerseys that had been used during the previous seven seasons. The new alternate uniform features a return to the Denver "rainbow skyline" logo, but uses the team's current color scheme and wordmark.  , For the 2015–16 season, the Nuggets will modify the script and numbering fonts on their home and away jerseys, with a gold "Nuggets" script on the home white jersey and a gold "Denver" script on the powder blue away jersey. Navy blue numerals trimmed in gold, as well as navy blue nameplates, will be featured on both the home and away jerseys. There is no word yet if there will be any changes to the alternate gold "skyline" jerseys as well as the team logos.  , The Nuggets hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who isn't signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.  This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. , 1 Number represents his total number of regular season victories. , Bold denotes still active with team.

They play in the Northwest Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA).  Founded in 1989, the team is owned by Glen Taylor .  The Timberwolves played their home games at the Metrodome during their inaugural season, before moving to Target Center in 1990.  , Like most expansion teams, the Timberwolves struggled in their early years, but after the acquisition of Kevin Garnett in the 1995 NBA draft , the team made the playoffs eight consecutive times from 1997 to 2004. Despite losing in the first round in their first seven attempts, the Timberwolves won their first division title in 2004 and advanced to the Western Conference Finals . Garnett was also named the NBA Most Valuable Player Award for that season.  The team has been in rebuilding mode for the past decade since missing the playoffs in 2005, and trading Garnett to the Boston Celtics in 2007.  Garnett returned to the Timberwolves in a February 2015 trade. , , , NBA basketball returned to the Twin Cities in 1989 for the first time since the Minneapolis Lakers departed for Los Angeles in 1960 . The NBA had granted one of its four new expansion teams on April 22, 1987 (the others being the Orlando Magic , Charlotte Hornets , and the Miami Heat ) to original owners Marv Wolfenson and Harvey Ratner to begin play for the 1989–90 season. (There were two American Basketball Association franchises, the Minnesota Muskies , in 1967–68, and the Minnesota Pipers , in 1968–69.) The franchise conducted a "name the team" contest  and eventually selected two finalists, "Timberwolves" and "Polars", in December 1986. The team then asked the 842 city councils in Minnesota to select the winner and "Timberwolves" prevailed by nearly 2 to 1.  The team was officially named the "Minnesota Timberwolves" on January 23, 1987. Minnesota is home to the largest population of timberwolves in the lower 48 states.  , The Timberwolves debuted on November 3, 1989, losing to the Seattle SuperSonics on the road 106–94. Five days later, they made their home debut at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome , losing to the Chicago Bulls 96–84. Two nights later on November 10, the Wolves got their first win, beating the Philadelphia 76ers at home 125–118. The Timberwolves, led by Tony Campbell with 23.2 ppg, went on to a 22–60 record, finishing in sixth place in the Midwest Division. Playing in the cavernous Metrodome, the expansion Timberwolves drew over 1 million fans  (an NBA record for attendance) including the third-largest crowd in NBA history at 49,551 on April 17, 1990, which saw the Timberwolves lose to the Denver Nuggets 99–88 in the final home game of the season.  , The next season , the team moved into their permanent home, the Target Center , and improved somewhat, finishing 29–53. However, they fired their head coach, Bill Musselman . They fared far worse in the 1991–92 NBA season under Musselman's successor, ex- Celtics coach Jimmy Rodgers , finishing with an NBA-worst 15–67 record. Looking to turn the corner, the Wolves hired former Detroit Pistons general manager Jack McCloskey to the same position, but even with notable first-round selections such as Christian Laettner and Isaiah Rider , the Timberwolves were unable to duplicate McCloskey's "Detroit Bad Boys" success in the Twin Cities, finishing 19–63 and 20–62 the next two seasons. One of the few highlights from that era was when the Target Center served as host of the 1994 All-Star Game where Rider won the Slam Dunk Contest with his between-the-leg "East Bay Funk Dunk".  , As winning basketball continued to elude the Wolves, Ratner and Wolfenson nearly sold the team to New Orleans interests in 1994 before NBA owners rejected the proposed move. Eventually, Glen Taylor bought the team and named Kevin McHale general manager. The Wolves finished 21–61 in 1994–95, and the future looked bleak.  However, a change was on the horizon. , In the 1995 NBA draft , the Timberwolves selected high school standout Kevin Garnett in the first round (5th overall),  and Flip Saunders was named head coach. Christian Laettner was traded along with Sean Rooks to the Atlanta Hawks for Andrew Lang and Spud Webb . Also, first-round pick Donyell Marshall was traded the previous season for Golden State Warriors ' forward Tom Gugliotta . These trades paved the way for rookie Kevin Garnett to become the go-to player inside. Garnett went on to average 10.4 ppg in his rookie season as the Wolves finished in 5th place in the Midwest Division, with a 26–56 record.  , In 1996, the Wolves added another star player in the draft, trading Ray Allen to the Milwaukee Bucks for the rights to Stephon Marbury , the 4th overall pick. The addition of Marbury had a positive effect on the entire team, as Garnett and Gugliotta became the first Wolves to be selected to the All-Star team. Gugliotta and Garnett led the Timberwolves in scoring as the team made the playoffs for the first time in franchise history with a record of 40–42. However, in the playoffs the Timberwolves made a quick exit as they were swept by the Houston Rockets in three straight games.  The T-Wolves also decided to change their image by changing their team logo and color scheme, adding black to the team colors and replacing the original logo with one featuring a snarling wolf looming over a field of trees. It was also during this season that Minnesota began to play on a parquet floor . , In 1997, Garnett and Marbury established themselves as two of the brightest rising stars in the NBA . Garnett averaged 18.5 ppg and 9.6 rebounds per game, while Marbury averaged 17.7 ppg and dished out 8.6 assists per game. Despite losing leading scorer Tom Gugliotta for half the season, the Timberwolves went on to post their first winning season at 45–37, making the playoffs for the second straight season. After dropping Game 1 of the playoffs on the road to the Seattle SuperSonics , the Timberwolves won their first postseason game in Game 2, winning in Seattle 98–93. As the series shifted to Minnesota, the Timberwolves had an opportunity to pull off the upset as they won Game 3 by a score of 98–90. However, the Wolves dropped Game 4 at home as the Sonics went on to win the series in five games.  , In 1998, a year after signing Kevin Garnett to an unprecedented six-year, $126 million contract, the Timberwolves were then used as the poster child of irresponsible spending as the NBA endured a four-month lockout that wiped out much of the season. With an already cap-heavy payroll, the Wolves let Tom Gugliotta walk, partially because the team wanted to save money in order to sign Stephon Marbury to a long-term contract, and in part because Gugliotta did not want to play with the young player. This move proved unsuccessful, however, as Stephon Marbury wanted to be the biggest star on a team and subsequently forced an in-season trade by refusing a contract extension. In the three-team mid-season deal that sent Marbury to the New Jersey Nets , the Wolves got Terrell Brandon in return and a first-round draft pick in the 1999 draft (which turned out to be the sixth pick). The Wolves made the playoffs for the third straight season by finishing in fourth place with a 25–25 record. In the playoffs, the Timberwolves were beaten by the eventual champion San Antonio Spurs in four games.  , In 1999, the Timberwolves drafted Wally Szczerbiak with the sixth pick in the draft.  He had a solid season, finishing third on the team in scoring with 11.6 points per game. Led by Kevin Garnett, who averaged 22.9 points per game and 11.8 rebounds per game, the Timberwolves had their first 50-win season and finished in 3rd place with a record of 50–32. However, in the playoffs the Wolves again fell in the first round, losing to the Portland Trail Blazers in four games.  The Wolves opened the 1999-00 regular season with a home and home against the Sacramento Kings at the Tokyo Dome November 6 and 7. , In the summer of 2000, Guard Malik Sealy was killed in a car accident by drunk driver Souksangouane Phengsene, who was driving the wrong way down the freeway. Sealy's number has since been retired: the number 2 jersey memorialized with Sealy's name on a banner hanging from the rafters of Target Center. The drunk driver was convicted of vehicular homicide and sentenced to four years in prison. He was previously arrested for drunk driving in Iowa in 1997 and has since been arrested twice more for driving while intoxicated, in 2006 and 2008.  , Also in that season, a free agent deal signed by Joe Smith was voided by the NBA, who ruled that the Timberwolves violated proper procedure in signing the contract. The league stripped the Timberwolves of five draft picks (first round 2001–05), but it was eventually reduced to three first-round picks (2001, 2002, and 2004). The league also fined the Timberwolves $3.5 million and suspended general manager Kevin McHale for one year. Smith eventually signed with the Detroit Pistons before re-signing with the Timberwolves in 2001. Despite those setbacks, the Timberwolves made the playoffs for the fifth straight season with a 47–35 record.  In the playoffs, the Timberwolves were eliminated in the first round again by the San Antonio Spurs in four games in the spring of 2001.  , With the arrival of newcomers Gary Trent , Loren Woods and Maurice Evans and the return of Joe Smith , the Timberwolves started the season by winning their first six games and a franchise-best 30–10 start. The Timberwolves had a franchise record 53-point win over Chicago in November. They finished with a 50–32 record: their second ever 50-win season that was highlighted by another All-Star appearance by Garnett and a breakout season by Wally Szczerbiak , who earned his first All-Star appearance. Once again, Minnesota lost in the first round of the playoffs, where they were swept by the Dallas Mavericks in three straight games.  , The 2002–03 season seemed to look up for the Timberwolves. Garnett had a great season where he finished second in MVP voting with 23.0 points per game and 13.4 rebounds per game and the Timberwolves finished in third place with a 51–31 record. As a result, they were awarded home court advantage for the first time when facing the three-time defending champion Los Angeles Lakers . After being blown out at home in Game 1, the Timberwolves had a chance to take a 3–1 series lead heading into the 4th quarter of Game 4 in Los Angeles, but the Lakers came back to win the game and eventually won the series in six games. In the end, the Timberwolves were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs for the seventh straight year.  , In 2003, the Timberwolves made two strong off-season moves, trading away forward Joe Smith and injured guard Terrell Brandon in a multi-player deal for Ervin Johnson , Sam Cassell and embattled guard Latrell Sprewell . , During the 2003–04 NBA season , the Timberwolves became the team to beat in the Western Conference. They finished the season as the top seed in the Western Conference with a record of 58–24, and beat the Denver Nuggets and Sacramento Kings in the first two rounds of the NBA playoffs. Kevin Garnett leapt upon the scorer's table upon the completion of Game 7 in the Sacramento series, one of the more defining moments in franchise playoff history. The Timberwolves' run ended in the Western Conference finals as the team lost to the Lakers, the previous Minnesota franchise. Due to an injured hip, Sam Cassell played only sparingly during the series with the Lakers. Garnett earned his first MVP award with 24.2 points, 13.9 rebounds and 5.0 assists per game.  , In the 2004–05 season , the Wolves kept the same team from the previous season. The team was plagued with contract disputes and the complaining of key players Latrell Sprewell , Sam Cassell , and Troy Hudson . Coach Flip Saunders was replaced in mid-season by GM Kevin McHale , who took over the team for the rest of the season. The Timberwolves finished 44–38, and missed the playoffs for the first time in eight years, by one game, to the Memphis Grizzlies . , During the 2005 offseason, McHale and the Wolves started their search for a head coach. McHale interviewed Seattle assistant coach Dwane Casey , San Antonio Spurs assistant P. J. Carlesimo , former coach John Lucas and Wolves assistants Randy Wittman , Sidney Lowe and Jerry Sichting , among others. , On June 17, 2005, the Timberwolves hired Casey as the new head coach. It was Casey's first head coaching job, making him the Wolves' seventh head coach in their 16-year history.  , In the 2005 draft , the Timberwolves selected Rashad McCants , a shooting guard from North Carolina with the 14th overall pick of the first round.  The Timberwolves also selected Bracey Wright , a guard from Indiana , with the 17th pick of the second round (47th overall).  , During the offseason, they traded All-Star Sam Cassell and a protected future first-round draft pick to the Los Angeles Clippers for Marko Jaric and Lionel Chalmers . They also signed free agent Nikoloz Tskitishvili .  , On January 26, 2006, the Wolves traded forward Wally Szczerbiak , centers Dwayne Jones and Michael Olowokandi , and a future first-round draft pick to the Boston Celtics . In return, they received forward-guard Ricky Davis , center Mark Blount , forward Justin Reed , guard Marcus Banks , and two second-round draft picks. In a separate trade on the same day, the Timberwolves traded Tskitishvili to the Phoenix Suns for a 2006 second-round draft pick. The Timberwolves finished 33–49, missing the playoffs for the second consecutive year.  , In the 2006 NBA draft , the Timberwolves selected future NBA Rookie of the Year Brandon Roy with the sixth overall pick, Craig Smith with the 36th pick, forward Bobby Jones with the 37th pick and center Loukas Mavrokefalidis with the 57th pick. The Timberwolves traded Roy to the Portland Trail Blazers for Randy Foye and cash considerations. The Timberwolves then traded Bobby Jones to the Philadelphia 76ers for a 2007 second-round pick and cash. , On January 23, McHale fired head coach Casey and replaced him with Randy Wittman . McHale explained in a news conference that it was inconsistency by Casey that led to the firing. Casey had compiled an overall record of 53–69. They finished the 2006–07 season with a record of 32–50, allowing them to keep their 2007 first-round pick.  , On July 31, 2007, the Minnesota Timberwolves reached a deal to trade All-Star Kevin Garnett to the Boston Celtics for Al Jefferson , Theo Ratliff , Gerald Green , Sebastian Telfair , Ryan Gomes , two first-round draft picks, and cash considerations. This is the largest combination of players and picks ever traded for a single player in NBA history.  Garnett and the Celtics went on to win the 2008 NBA Finals in six games over the Los Angeles Lakers. , That summer, the Timberwolves traded Mike James and Justin Reed to the Houston Rockets for Juwan Howard .  In October of the same year, the Timberwolves waived Howard after reaching a contractual buyout agreement, worth $10 million of roughly $14.25 million which Minnesota would have owed him. The team also traded Ricky Davis and Mark Blount to the Miami Heat in exchange for the Heat's Antoine Walker , Michael Doleac , Wayne Simien , and a 2008 protected first-round draft pick. , In the 2007 NBA draft the Timberwolves selected Corey Brewer , with the 7th pick, and Chris Richard with the 41st overall pick, from the two-time NCAA national champion Florida Gators .  , Minnesota began the NBA preseason with two games in London and Istanbul , as part of NBA Europe Live 2007. On October 10, The Wolves lost to Garnett and the revamped Celtics, 92–81. To start the season, the Wolves began 0–5 before ending the drought with a home win over Sacramento . That drought also brought about speculation of the possible dismissal of coach Wittman. The youngest team in the NBA began adjusting to life after trading franchise star Garnett to Boston, meanwhile playing without budding talent Randy Foye for the first half of the season. Guards Sebastian Telfair and Marko Jaric were deputized as starting point guards during Foye's injury absence. The Timberwolves finished the season 22–60.  On a handful of occasions during the season, the team showed flashes of its potential in wins or very close contests with top-tier teams. , In the 2008 NBA draft , the Timberwolves selected O. J. Mayo of USC with the third overall pick. When the draft concluded, the Timberwolves traded Mayo, Antoine Walker , Greg Buckner , and Marko Jaric to the Memphis Grizzlies in exchange for fifth overall pick Kevin Love , Mike Miller , Jason Collins , and Brian Cardinal in a move that Jim Stack called, "a deal we couldn’t pass up.”  , In 2008, in celebration of the franchise's twentieth anniversary, the team unveiled a new logo and uniforms. The new designs first appeared in the first preseason game against the Chicago Bulls at United Center on October 14, 2008. They also refurbished the floor at Target Center , returning to the traditional floor pattern and added touches of varnish while exposing most of the hardwood. , On December 8, 2008, after a 23-point loss to the Los Angeles Clippers that dropped the team to 4–15, the Timberwolves fired head coach Wittman and McHale took over. McHale also relinquished his vice president of basketball operations duties. It was unclear whether McHale's future with the team was dependent on the success or progress of the team which he had put together over the previous four years. , Those questions seemed to be answered when the Timberwolves went 10–4 for the month of January, giving McHale the coach of the month honors. But on February 8, 2009, the team's main star Al Jefferson tore his ACL in his right knee in a game at New Orleans , sidelining him for the rest of the season. At the time of the injury, Jefferson was having his best season to date, averaging 23 points, 11 rebounds and 2 blocks.  Without Jefferson and Corey Brewer (who also suffered a season-ending injury), the Wolves sputtered, to finish with a 24–58 record.  , On June 17, 2009, new president of basketball operations David Kahn announced that McHale would not be returning to the team as head coach. Kahn did not give a specific reason for McHale's dismissal, only saying "this is going to be a transition period." For his part, McHale said he wanted to come back but was not offered a contract. Later, in August, the Timberwolves announced the signing of Kurt Rambis , then an assistant for the Los Angeles Lakers , to a four-year, $8 million contract to be their new head coach. In Rambis' first season, the team stumbled to the second-worst record in the league, as their 15–67 record was only surpassed by that of the New Jersey Nets , who finished at 12–70.  , On July 12, 2010, Minnesota traded for Miami Heat forward Michael Beasley , the second pick from the 2008 NBA draft .  In a locally untelevised game on November 12, 2010, Kevin Love grabbed a franchise-record 31 rebounds and scored 31 points in a win over the New York Knicks , the NBA's first 30–30 game in 28 years.  , Love was later named an All Star for the 2010–11 NBA season, the franchise's first All Star selection since Kevin Garnett in 2007. Love would later break Garnett's team record of 37 straight double-doubles on February 8, 2011 in a win over the Houston Rockets . On March 8, 2011, Love acquired his 52nd straight double-double, surpassing the mark of Moses Malone for the most consecutive double-doubles since the NBA-ABA merger in a win over the Indiana Pacers . The streak eventually reached 53 games and came to an end with a six-point, 12-rebound performance in a 100–77 loss to the Golden State Warriors on March 13. In October 2011, Love was ranked 16th among active players by ESPN .  , On February 21, 2011, Corey Brewer and Kosta Koufos were traded to the New York Knicks and Denver Nuggets respectively for Knicks Anthony Randolph and Eddy Curry (plus $3 million in cash from New York and a 2015 second-round draft pick from Denver) as part of a larger trade that sent all-star Carmelo Anthony from Denver to New York.  , On the downside, with a 121–102 loss to the Houston Rockets, the Timberwolves fell to 17–65, finishing last in the Western Conference for the second straight year. They also clinched the 2010-11 NBA season 's worst record. During the offseason, the Timberwolves were finally able to bring 2009 fifth overall pick Ricky Rubio over from Spain. In the 2011 NBA draft , with the second overall pick, the Timberwolves selected Derrick Williams of Arizona . The Timberwolves then traded guard Jonny Flynn and the draft rights to Donatas Motiejunas (No. 20) to the Houston Rockets for center Brad Miller , the draft rights to Nikola Mirotic (No. 23), Chandler Parsons (No. 38) and a future first-round pick. The Timberwolves traded Mirotic’s rights to the Chicago Bulls for the rights to Norris Cole (No. 28) and Malcolm Lee (No. 43). The Timberwolves then sold the rights to Parsons back to the Rockets. The Timberwolves traded Norris Cole (No. 28) to the Miami Heat for the draft rights to Bojan Bogdanovic (No. 31), a future second-round pick and cash considerations. The Timberwolves then traded Bogdanovic's rights to the New Jersey Nets for a future second-rounder and cash. The Trail Blazers traded the draft rights to Tanguy Ngombo (No. 57) to the Timberwolves.  , On July 12, 2011, Kurt Rambis was fired as coach of the team after compiling a 32–132 record in two seasons with the team. On September 13, 2011, the team announced that they had hired Rick Adelman to be the team's new head coach.   , The Timberwolves began the 2011-12 NBA season with a 17–17 record before the All-Star break.  On March 9, 2012, Rubio tore his left ACL and LCL in a collision with Kobe Bryant . The injury ended his season and severely hurt the Timberwolves' chances of making the playoffs. Despite being in contention at mid-season, the team ultimately failed to reach the postseason for the eighth straight year due to injuries to a number of key players.    The team finished with a record of 26-40, with the only win of the team's final fourteen games coming against the Detroit Pistons .  The team traded the 18th overall pick of the 2012 NBA draft to the Houston Rockets for Chase Budinger . , On June 26, 2012,      the Timberwolves selected Robbie Hummel with the 58th overall pick, the team's only selection during the draft.  During the offseason, the team signed former Timberwolves draft pick Brandon Roy to a two-year, $10 million contract.  The deal was announced on July 31.  With the inclusion of Roy in the shooting guard position, players that also signed during the offseason included Andrei Kirilenko , Alexey Shved and Louis Amundson . While technically in playoff contention early, multiple injuries began to plague the team. Roy, Budinger, Lee and free agent signing Josh Howard succumbed to knee injuries. The mood of despair was shortly lifted by the splashy return of Rubio.  But not long after, Love, who missed the first nine games of the season after fracturing the third and fourth metacarpals in his right hand in a preseason home workout, suffered a recurrence of the injury in a win over the Denver Nuggets on January 3.  One of the few highlights in the second half of the season was Rubio's triple-double performance during a surprising win over the then-first place San Antonio Spurs , albeit without Spurs stars Tony Parker and Tim Duncan playing due to injury.  On April 6, in a game against the Detroit Pistons, Adelman won his 1000th game as a head coach.  This season marked the first time the franchise had won at least 30 games without Kevin Garnett on the roster.  The team decided to part ways with David Kahn after the season ended,  with Flip Saunders being brought in to replace him.  In the 2013 NBA draft , the team traded the 9th overall pick Trey Burke for Shabazz Muhammad (14th pick) and Gorgui Dieng (21st pick) in the first round from the Utah Jazz.  , On March 28, 2014, the Timberwolves set a franchise record for points in a regular season game with a 143-107 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. The win also marked the Timberwolves' first season-series win over the Lakers since the 2005–06 season.  The team accumulated 40 wins for the first time since the 2005 season, but missed the playoffs for the tenth consecutive year.  On April 21, 2014, Rick Adelman announced his retirement from coaching in the NBA. Adelman acquired a 97-133 record in three seasons with the team. , On August 23, 2014, the Timberwolves, Cleveland Cavaliers , and Philadelphia 76ers agreed on a three-way trade that would send Kevin Love to the Cavaliers to join LeBron James . Minnesota received Andrew Wiggins , Anthony Bennett , Thaddeus Young , and a trade exception as part of the deal. The 76ers received Alexey Shved , Luc Mbah a Moute , and a 2015 first-round pick via the Miami Heat .  , The 2014–15 season marked a new era for the Timberwolves, beginning with the Kevin Love trade. Flip Saunders was promoted to head coach, making it his second stint with the Timberwolves after coaching the team from 1995 to 2005. The Timberwolves started the new season with a 105-101 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies , with Wiggins making his debut. The team recorded its first win the following game, a 97-91 victory over the Detroit Pistons .  On November 12, 2014, the Timberwolves played a "home" game at Mexico City Arena against the Houston Rockets . On February 19, 2015, Garnett, at the time with the Brooklyn Nets , waived his no-trade clause to enable a trade back to Minnesota which sent Thaddeus Young to Brooklyn. In Garnett's first game back, he resumed wearing the No. 21 jersey that had not been worn by any other Timberwolf since his departure, while the team cruised past the Washington Wizards 97-77. The Timberwolves posted 66 losses during the season and missed the playoffs for the 11th consecutive year. , Despite missing the playoffs, Wiggins was selected as the NBA Rookie of the Year , the first player in franchise history to be so honored. Draft pick Zach LaVine gained league notoriety after winning the Slam Dunk Contest . LaVine and Wiggins are seen as being the future of the franchise, and were dubbed "The Bounce Brothers".  , Due to having the worst record in the NBA for the 2014-15 season, the Timberwolves had the highest chance, at 25%, to receive the first pick in the 2015 NBA Draft at the 2015 NBA draft lottery. On May 19, the Timberwolves received the first overall pick in the 2015 NBA Draft for the first time in franchise history. On June 25th, 2015 the Timberwolves selected Karl-Anthony Towns as the number one pick. , The current Minnesota Timberwolves logo (2008–present) , Alternate logo (2008–present) , Second alternate logo (2008–present) , Crunch the Wolf is the official mascot of the Minnesota Timberwolves. , In their inaugural season in 1989, the Timberwolves (or "Wolves" as it said on their jerseys) debuted blue road uniforms with green lettering and numbers with white. Their home uniforms featured blue lettering and numbers with green outlining. The creation of both uniforms was led by head designer, Brian Mulligan.  There was going to be a green alternate jersey with blue lettering to go with the uniforms, but the idea was dropped. It would've followed a similar move the Dallas Mavericks took when they switched back to blue in the early 1990s, opting the Wolves a chance to use green for a jersey color instead.  After drafting Kevin Garnett , the Timberwolves design team, under guidance from Brian Mulligan, changed their uniforms yet again in 1996.  This time, the team added black and grey to the mix, and changing to a darker shade of blue.  The front of the jerseys then said the team's full name "Timberwolves" in a different font. In 1998, a black alternate uniform was introduced. Those uniforms were used until the 2007-08 season.  The uniforms changed again in the 2008 off-season, this time with the road jerseys reading "Minnesota" and the home jerseys reading "Wolves", similar to that of the team's early years. Both uniforms had green, black, grey and blue on the pits and sides of the shorts.  After two seasons, the uniforms went through other small changes, mainly eliminating the green from the collar, jersey and shorts. The team also adjusted their number font again, and introduced another alternate uniform the same year, once again featuring the color black.  In the 2013-14 season, the team changed their alternate jersey to a short sleeved jersey that was black with white lettering. The change came about due to the NBA's introduction of sleeved jerseys. , The Timberwolves hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who isn't signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.  This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. , Bold denotes still active with team. , Points scored (regular season) (as of the end of the 2014-15 season)  , Other statistics (regular season) (as of the middle of the 2014-15 season)  , Minutes played , Rebounds , Assists , Steals , Blocks , NBA MVP , NBA Rookie of the Year , NBA Most Improved Player , NBA Slam Dunk Contest , All-NBA First Team , All-NBA Second Team , All-NBA Third Team , NBA All-Defensive First Team , NBA All-Defensive Second Team , NBA Rookie First Team , NBA Rookie Second Team , NBA All-Star Game MVP , J.

Before that, KFAN (AM) had been the Timberwolves' Twin Cities flagship station since the team's inception, except for a brief two-year hiatus to KLCI BOB 106.1 FM for the 2006–07 and 2007–08 seasons. Alan Horton has been the team's radio play-by-play announcer since the 2009–2010 season.  , Games are broadcast on Fox Sports North . Broadcasters are Dave Benz and Jim Petersen .    The Oklahoma City Thunder is [ A ] an American professional basketball team based in Oklahoma City , Oklahoma . The team plays in the Northwest Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA).   Its home court is at Chesapeake Energy Arena .  The Thunder's NBA Development League affiliate is the Oklahoma City Blue , which is owned by the Thunder.  The Thunder is the only team in the major professional North American sports leagues based in the state of Oklahoma. , The team was established as the Seattle SuperSonics in 1967. They relocated in 2008 after a settlement was reached between the ownership group led by Clay Bennett and lawmakers in Seattle , Washington following a lawsuit. As the SuperSonics, the franchise qualified for the NBA Playoffs 22 times, won their division six times, and won the 1979 NBA Championship . In Oklahoma City, the Thunder qualified for their first playoff berth during the 2009–10 season. They followed that success by winning their first division title as the Thunder in the 2010–11 season and their first Western Conference championship as the Thunder in the 2011–12 season, appearing in the NBA Finals for the fourth time in franchise history and first since 1996 , when the club was based in Seattle. , , , The Thunder's previous incarnation, the Seattle SuperSonics, were formed in 1967. In their 41 years in Seattle, the SuperSonics compiled a 1,745–1,585 (.524) win–loss record in the regular season and 107–110 (.493) in the playoffs. The franchise's titles include three Western Conference championships and one NBA title in 1979 . , In 2006, Howard Schultz sold the SuperSonics for $350 million to a group of Oklahoma City investors led by Clay Bennett, a move approved by NBA owners the following October.  In 2007, Bennett announced that the franchise would move to Oklahoma City as soon as the lease with KeyArena expired.  , In June 2008, a lawsuit brought by the City of Seattle against Bennett due to his attempts to break the final two years of the Sonics' lease at KeyArena went to federal court. Nearly a month later, the two sides reached a settlement agreement. The terms awarded the city $45 million to get out of the remaining lease at KeyArena, and could provide an additional $30 million payment to Seattle in 2013 if certain conditions are met. The owners agreed to leave the SuperSonics name, logo and colors in Seattle for a possible future NBA franchise;  however, the items would remain the property of the Oklahoma City team along with other "assets," including championship banners and trophies.  On September 3, 2008, the team name, logo, and colors for the Oklahoma City franchise were revealed to the public. The name "Thunder" was chosen due to Oklahoma being a frequent victim of powerful storms due to its location in Tornado Alley , and Oklahoma City housing the 45th Infantry Division , the Thunderbirds.   , The Thunder participated in the Orlando Pro Summer League featuring their second-year players, potential free agents and rookies. The players wore generic black and white jerseys reading "OKC-NBA" against an outline of a basketball. The Thunder's temporary practice facility was the Sawyer Center at Southern Nazarene University , which had been used by the New Orleans Hornets when they relocated to Oklahoma City after Hurricane Katrina .  , The Thunder played several preseason games before the 2008–2009 regular season, but only one of those games was in Oklahoma City. The Thunder made their first appearance in Billings, Montana on October 8, 2008 in an 88–82 preseason loss against the Minnesota Timberwolves .  The Thunder played their first Ford Center game on October 14 against the Los Angeles Clippers .  , In their regular-season home opener, the Thunder faced (and lost to) the Milwaukee Bucks. Earl Watson scored the first points of the season with a layup. Three nights later on November 2, the Thunder won their first game as a franchise by defeating the Timberwolves, improving their record to 1–3. The team then went on a 10-game losing streak before deciding on November 22 to fire head coach P. J. Carlesimo and assistant Paul Westhead . Assistant coach Scott Brooks then took over on an interim basis.  Oklahoma City lost its next four games to tie the dubious franchise losing streak of 14 set in Seattle the previous season. But the team managed to prevent history by winning their next game on the road against the Memphis Grizzlies .  , As the season continued, the Thunder began to improve. After starting 3–29, the Thunder finished the regular season 20–30 for the remaining fifty games. Not only were they winning more often, they played much more competitively than in the first part of the season. The team brought their record to 23–59 and improved upon their record of 20–62 from the team's final season in Seattle. The late-season successes of the Thunder contributed to the signing of Scott Brooks as the team's official head coach. , After moving to Oklahoma City from Seattle, the team's operating situation improved markedly. In December 2008, Forbes magazine estimated the team's franchise value at $300 million – a 12 percent increase from the previous year's $268 million when the club was located in Seattle.  Forbes also noted an increase in percentage of available tickets sold, from 78 percent in the team's last season in Seattle to 100 percent in 2008–09.  , After an inaugural season filled with many adjustments, the Thunder hoped to improve during their second season in Oklahoma City. Oklahoma City did not make any major moves in the offseason, other than drafting James Harden from Arizona State University with the third overall pick in the NBA Draft . The Thunder selected Rodrigue Beaubois with the 25th pick in the 2009 draft before immediately trading him to the Dallas Mavericks for the 24th pick, center Byron Mullens from Ohio State University . The team then added veteran center Etan Thomas and guard Kevin Ollie . The last major change to their roster occurred on December 22, 2009, when the team traded for Eric Maynor from the Utah Jazz . Maynor immediately supplanted Ollie as the backup point guard. , From the outset the young team looked determined and cohesive. The increasing leadership of Kevin Durant , along with the growing experience of the Thunder's younger players (including future All-Stars Russell Westbrook , James Harden and Serge Ibaka ), were signs of the Thunder's improvement. The 2009–10 season included several victories over the NBA's elite teams, including a 28-point blowout over the Eastern Conference champion Orlando Magic and a 16-point blowout of the reigning NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers. Road victories over the San Antonio Spurs , Utah Jazz , Miami Heat , Boston Celtics and Dallas Mavericks further enhanced their reputation. Though they hovered around .500 for the first half of the season, they went on a 9-game winning streak that sent them into serious playoff contention. Kevin Durant became the youngest player in league history to win the scoring title, averaging 30.1 points per game while playing in all 82 games. , The Thunder finished 50–32, more than doubling their win total from the previous season. The 50–32 tied with the 2008 Denver Nuggets as the best 8th seed in the modern Playoffs era, at least in terms of record. The Oklahoma City Thunder also had the same record as the Boston Celtics in this season.  They finished fourth in the Northwest Division and eighth in the Western Conference playoff standings, and earned a spot in the 2010 NBA Playoffs . On April 22, the team secured their first playoff win in Oklahoma City when they defeated the defending-champion Los Angeles Lakers 101–96. This was also the Thunder's first playoff win at the Ford Center. However, the Thunder tied the series at 2 games each, but the Lakers won the last 2 games in the series to win it 4-2. , Oklahoma City ranked twelfth in overall attendance in the NBA, and seventh in percentage of available seats occupied (98 percent, including 28 sellouts in 41 home games).  The team's operating situation also continued to improve in 2009–10. Forbes magazine estimated the team's franchise value at $310 million (an increase of $10 million over the prior year) with an estimated operating profit of $12.7 million (the first operating profit in years for the franchise).  , Financially, the Thunder organization continued to build on the positive returns experienced from relocating from Seattle to Oklahoma City. In January 2011, Forbes magazine estimated the franchise's worth at $329 million, up six percent from 2009–10 and ranking No. 18 in the NBA.  The magazine also estimated the franchise's revenue at $118 million and operating profit at $22.6 million – up 6.3 percent and 78 percent, respectively, from the previous year.   The Thunder finished the 2010–2011 season with a 55–27 record, a five-win increase from their breakout season the previous year. The team also captured their first division title since moving to Oklahoma City, and seventh in franchise history.  , In the wake of a fourth-seed versus fifth-seed match-up against the Denver Nuggets , Kevin Durant scored 41 points in Game 1 to set a new career playoff high. In the final game of the series, he again scored 41 and forward Serge Ibaka nearly tied the record for most blocks in a playoff game (10, set by Mark Eaton , Hakeem Olajuwon and Andrew Bynum ) with 9 blocks.  The Thunder won the series 4 games to 1 and were set to face off against the Memphis Grizzlies who achieved an eight-seed upset over the San Antonio Spurs just days before. The Thunder advanced to the Western Conference Finals with a seven-game series triumph over the Grizzlies. Durant was again the star, scoring 39 points in the clinching Game 7, while Russell Westbrook also had a triple-double. Despite hard-fought battles with the eventual NBA champs, the Thunder fell to the Dallas Mavericks 4–1 in the Western Conference Finals. The Thunder had a chance to tie the series in Game 4, but they were unable to hold a 15-point lead with five minutes remaining in the fourth quarter. They ended up losing in overtime by the score of 112–105. , During the extended lockout, Thunder players played in exhibition games and even local pickup games to stay in shape.     When the abbreviated training camp began, Oklahoma City started with an intact roster and all players, except for Russell Westbrook . In addition, Kendrick Perkins lost more than 30 pounds during the lockout. The Thunder made their two pre-season appearances, after the lockout, against the Dallas Mavericks , winning both games. They won their first regular-season game against Orlando at home and went on a five-game winning streak. Kevin Durant became the sixth player to score 30 or more points in four consecutive games at the start of a season. In addition, the Thunder was the first to sweep their back-to-back-to-back games, winning a home-and-home series with the Houston Rockets , then routing the San Antonio Spurs . Thunder players Durant, Westbrook, Harden, Perkins, and Ibaka made it onto the 2012 All-Star ballots. After the Thunder's win over the Utah Jazz on February 11, 2012, Scott Brooks was named the Head Coach of the Western Conference All-Star squad for the 2012 NBA All-Star Game in Orlando, Florida. , In the 2012 NBA Playoffs , the Thunder swept the defending champion Dallas Mavericks in the first round to advance and face off against their first-round foes from 2010, the Los Angeles Lakers . They defeated the Lakers in five games and advanced to play the San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference Finals. The Thunder lost the first two games against the Spurs but won the next three including a Game 5 road win, to take a commanding 3–2 game lead in the series. In Game 6, the Thunder defeated the Spurs 107–99 and advanced to the 2012 NBA Finals . Durant led the way with 34 points, playing all of regulation time in the game. In the 2012 NBA Finals against the Miami Heat , the Thunder won the first game at home but then lost four in a row and lost the series in five games. , In the 2012 NBA draft , the Thunder selected Baylor University forward Perry Jones III with the 28th overall pick. The Thunder also signed free agents Hasheem Thabeet and Daniel Orton , and signed guards Andy Rautins and DeAndre Liggins . They re-signed forward Serge Ibaka to a four-year, $48 million extension. After failing to sign James Harden to an extension that was reportedly worth four years and $52 million, the team decided to trade Harden rather than having to pay the luxury tax penalty. On October 27, 2012, the Thunder traded Harden along with center Cole Aldrich and forwards Daequan Cook and Lazar Hayward to the Houston Rockets for Kevin Martin , Jeremy Lamb , first-round draft picks from Toronto and Dallas , and one second-round draft pick. Martin took over Harden's sixth-man role for the season. The Thunder finished with a 60–22 regular season, taking both the Northwest division title and top seed of the Western Conference. In the first round of the playoffs, they faced the 8th-seeded Houston Rockets, featuring former team member James Harden. In game 2 of the series, Russell Westbrook was struck by Rockets point guard Patrick Beverley, and fell down with an injury and missed the rest of the playoffs after having knee surgery. Without the team's second-leading scorer, the Thunder, who had a 3–0 lead, lost the next two games to bring the series to 3–2. In game 6, the Thunder defeated the Rockets to advance to the second round, facing a rematch of the 2011 second round, with the Memphis Grizzlies. The Thunder lost the series 4–1, losing four straight games after winning Game 1 at home. , In the 2013 NBA draft , the Thunder selected 12th pick Steven Adams , traded for the 26th pick Andre Roberson, and 47th pick Grant Jerrett. Kevin Martin's contract expired, soon signing with the Timberwolves. In addition to Oklahoma City's offseason movements, they signed free agent Ryan Gomes and re-signed Derek Fisher. The team finished 2nd in the conference to San Antonio with a 59-23 record. They met with the Memphis Grizzlies for the 3rd time in the playoffs, hoping for a revenge after last year's finish. The series set a record for most consecutive overtimes in a series with 4. OKC would prevail in 7 games to play the Los Angeles Clippers for the first time, whom they finished in 6. Their final opponent in the Western Conference Finals were the San Antonio Spurs, with the San Antonio Spurs winning 4-2. , With the 21st and 29th pick in the NBA draft, the Thunder selected Mitch McGary from Michigan and Josh Huestis from Stanford. "He brings energy, passion, and great basketball IQ and toughness what we value" said Presti on drafting McGary. Oklahoma City also signed Semaj Christon in the draft. On July 3, the Thunder signed Sebastian Telfair . But they lost a major piece in shooting guard Thabo Sefolosha as his contract expired, after agreeing to a 3-year, 12 million dollar contract with the Atlanta Hawks . Several weeks before the season even started, the Thunder suffered a major setback. Durant was diagnosed with a Jones fracture in his right foot and missed the first 17 games of the season. During the opening game against the Portland Trailblazers , Westbrook scored 38 points, but found himself sidelined due to a small fracture on his right hand. He missed 14 games, during which Oklahoma City went 4-12. During the middle of the season Westbrook and Durant would both come back, and similarly suffer more injuries. Durant was ruled out of the rest of the season in March, deciding to have foot surgery. Westbrook also had to undergo surgery in early March, to repair a fracture in the zygomatic arch bone of his right cheek. Several days later he returned and put on perhaps the best stretch of his career for the rest of the season. Westbrook would recorded several triple doubles on his way to Western Conference Player of the Month honors from February-April. He would also gain the 2014-2015 NBA scoring title. However despite the effort, the Thunder would miss out on the playoffs, and Westbrook would fall short of the MVP award, finishing fourth in voting. They would finish with a 45-37 record. On April 22, 2015, Scott Brooks was fired from being the Thunder head coach. Billy Donovan was hired on April 30, 2015. This will be Donovan's first major NBA coaching job, after he initially accepted and then left the Orlando Magic job in 2007.   , For details on Seattle SuperSonics history, please visit Seattle SuperSonics Records . , Points : 54 (2 times) , by Kevin Durant vs. Golden State Warriors , January 17, 2014 and Russell Westbrook vs. Indiana Pacers , April 12, 2015 , Rebounds : 22 , Serge Ibaka vs. Dallas Mavericks , February 19, 2015 , Assists : 17 , by Russell Westbrook vs. Denver Nuggets , February 22, 2015 , Steals : 7 (2 times) , by Russell Westbrook vs. Golden State Warriors , January 27, 2012 and Thabo Sefolosha vs. Milwaukee Bucks , April 9, 2012 , Blocks : 11 , by Serge Ibaka vs. Denver Nuggets , February 19, 2012 , Points in a playoff game : 43 , by Russell Westbrook vs. Miami Heat , June 19, 2012 , Note: All arenas used before 2008 were used by the defunct Seattle SuperSonics franchise. , Seattle arenas had hosted two NBA All-Star Games ; the 1974 game in Seattle Center Coliseum and the 1987 game in the Kingdome , where SuperSonics forward Tom Chambers grabbed MVP honors. , Opened in 2002, Chesapeake Energy Arena was built without luxury accommodations, but designed to accommodate luxury "buildouts" should a professional sports franchise locate to the city. , A plan for such build-out improvements began in 2007. It came in the wake of the acquisition of the Seattle Supersonics by an Oklahoma City-based ownership group the previous October. A city ballot initiative approved by a 62 percent margin on March 4, 2008, extended a prior one-cent city sales tax for a period of fifteen months in order to fund $101 million in budgeted improvements to the arena and a separate $20 million practice facility for a relocated franchise.  , Renovation work on the arena was delayed by a sales tax-receipts shortfall during the 2008-10 economic crisis.  Revised plans limited the size of a new glass entryway and eliminated a practice court to accommodate the shortfall.  Major construction work on the arena expansion was also delayed from the summer of 2010 to the summer of 2011. Seating capacity of the stadium is 18,203 for professional NBA basketball games. , Similar revisions were made to the plans for the Thunder's separate practice facility, for a total cost savings of approximately $14 million.  The Thunder's practice facility completion date was pushed back to approximately March 2011.  , Note: All mascots used before 2008 were used by the defunct Seattle SuperSonics franchise. , On February 17, 2009, Rumble the Bison was introduced as the new Oklahoma City Thunder mascot during halftime of a game against the New Orleans Hornets . Rumble was the winner of the 2008–2009 NBA Mascot of the Year.  , During the 2012 NBA Finals, sportswriter Bill Simmons published a piece on the team's fan base in his ESPN -sponsored Web outlet, Grantland.com , in which he noted the unusual enthusiasm of the city for its team: , Simmons speculated that the Oklahoma City bombing played a major part in the team's culture, noting that Thunder general manager Sam Presti has every new Thunder player visit the Oklahoma City National Memorial , and encourages players to look into the stands and consider that many of the team's fans were personally affected by the event. He also noted, however, that the fact that the Thunder is the only team from Oklahoma City (or indeed the state) in one of the nation's four major leagues contributes mightily to the city's devotion.  , Thunder fans are also reportedly much more likely to attend major home games than most other NBA fanbases. According to a source in the ticket industry, only 5 percent of tickets to the 2012 NBA conference finals listed for sale on secondary market sites such as StubHub were for Thunder home games, and for every ticket listed for a Thunder home game in the 2012 NBA Finals, 10 tickets for Heat home games were listed.  , The Thunder hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who isn't signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.  This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. , For details on Seattle SuperSonics history, see Seattle SuperSonics records . , NBA Most Valuable Player , NBA All-Star head coach , NBA Coach of the Year , NBA Sixth Man of the Year , NBA scoring champion , All-NBA First Team , All-NBA Second Team , NBA All-Defensive First Team , NBA All-Defensive Second Team , NBA Rookie of the Year , NBA Rookie First Team , NBA Rookie Second Team , NBA All-Star Team , NBA All Star Game Most Valuable Player , As the Oklahoma City Thunder's original iteration, the Seattle SuperSonics retired six numbers. In addition, the Supersonics awarded an honorary microphone to longtime broadcaster Bob Blackburn , who had called the majority of the team's games from 1967 through 1992.  , The Oklahoma City Thunder unveiled their first logo on September 3, 2008. According to majority owner Clay Bennett , the team's logo takes several of its elements from other Oklahoma sports teams such as the collegiate Sooners and Cowboys .  The uniform design was unveiled on September 29, 2008.   , An alternate uniform was unveiled on November 8, 2012, featuring only navy blue and white colors. Unlike their regular uniforms, the wordmarks on the alternate are written vertically.   , A second alternate uniform was unveiled on March 1, 2015. A white uniform with sleeves, it features the Thunder partial logo in the center of the chest, and the shorts showcase bolts in light blue and sunset colors.  , All Thunder games are broadcast on the Thunder Radio Network, fronted by flagship stations WWLS-FM 98.1 and KWPN AM 640 in Oklahoma City. Matt Pinto is the radio voice of the Thunder.  , For their first two seasons, the Thunder's TV broadcasts were split between Fox Sports Oklahoma (a regional fork of Fox Sports Southwest ), which broadcast most of the games, and independent station KSBI (channel 52), with around 65 Thunder games airing during the season and more than half of the games available in HD on Fox Sports Oklahoma, along with other team-related programming such as pre-game shows. Around 15 to 20 regular-season games were broadcast over the air on KSBI, which had a network of re-broadcasters spanning the entire state. All televised games are called by Brian Davis on play-by-play and Michael Cage as color commentator.   During the 2009–10 season , KSBI telecast all Thunder games it aired in high definition (KSBI had previously aired in HD the first regular-season game played at the Ford Center – against the Milwaukee Bucks on October 29, 2008 – while all other games during the 2008–09 season were telecast on KSBI in standard definition). On August 3, 2010, the Thunder signed a new exclusive multi-year agreement with Fox Sports Oklahoma, beginning with the 2010–11 season , ending the team's broadcasts on KSBI.  On October 22, 2012, the Thunder announced that Lesley McCaslin would be the new Thunder sideline reporter.  On July 21, 2014, the Thunder announced that Long would not return to be its TV color commentator on Fox Sports Oklahoma.  On September 17, 2014, the Oklahoma City Thunder announced that 15-year NBA veteran Michael Cage would be the new color analyst, joining Brian Davis on television and Matt Pinto on the radio when the game is not on Fox Sports Oklahoma.   The Portland Trail Blazers , commonly known as the Blazers , are a professional basketball team based in Portland , Oregon . They play in the Northwest Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Trail Blazers played their home games in the Memorial Coliseum before moving to Moda Center in 1995 (called the Rose Garden until 2013). The franchise entered the league in 1970, and Portland has been its only home city. The franchise has enjoyed a strong following; from 1977 through 1995, the team sold out 814 consecutive home games, the longest such streak in American major professional sports at the time, only since surpassed by the Cleveland Indians and the Boston Red Sox .  The Trail Blazers have been the only NBA team based in the binational Pacific Northwest , after the Vancouver Grizzlies relocated to Memphis and became the Memphis Grizzlies in 2001, and the Seattle SuperSonics relocated to Oklahoma City and became the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2008. , The team has advanced to the NBA Finals three times, winning the NBA Championship once in 1977 . Their other NBA Finals appearances were in 1990 and 1992 .  The team has qualified for the playoffs in 31 seasons of their 45-season existence, including a streak of 21 straight appearances from 1983 through 2003, the second longest streak in NBA history.   The Trail Blazers' 31 playoff appearances rank third in the NBA only behind the Los Angeles Lakers and San Antonio Spurs since the team's inception in 1970.  Six Hall of Fame players have played for the Trail Blazers ( Lenny Wilkens , Bill Walton , Clyde Drexler , Dražen Petrović , Arvydas Sabonis , and Scottie Pippen ).  Bill Walton is the franchise's most decorated player; he was the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player in 1977 , and the regular season MVP the following year .   Four Blazer rookies ( Geoff Petrie , Sidney Wicks , Brandon Roy and Damian Lillard ) have won the NBA Rookie of the Year award. Two Hall of Fame coaches, Lenny Wilkens and Jack Ramsay , have patrolled the sidelines for the Blazers, and two others, Mike Schuler and Mike Dunleavy , have won the NBA Coach of the Year award with the team.  , , , Sports promoter Harry Glickman sought after a National Basketball Association (NBA) franchise for Portland as far back as 1955 when he proposed two new expansion teams, the other to be located in Los Angeles .  When the Memorial Coliseum was opened in 1960 Glickman saw the potential it could serve as a professional basketball venue but it was not until February 6, 1970 that the NBA board of governors granted him the rights to a franchise in Portland.  To raise the money for the $3.7 million admission tax, Glickman associated himself to real estate magnates Bob Schmertz of New Jersey, Larry Weinberg of Los Angeles and Herman Sarkowsky of Seattle.  Two weeks later, on February 24, team management held a contest to select the team's name and received more than 10,000 entries. The most popular choice was "Pioneers," but that name was excluded from consideration as it was already used by sports teams at Portland's Lewis and Clark College . The name "Trail Blazers" received 172 entries, and was ultimately selected by the judging panel, being revealed on March 13 in the halftime of a SuperSonics game at the Memorial Coliseum. Derived from the trail blazing activity by explorers making paths through forests, Glickman considered a name that could “reflect both the ruggedness of the Pacific Northwest and the start of a major league era in our state.” Despite initial mixed response, the Trail Blazers name, often shortened to just "Blazers", became popular in Oregon.  , Along with the Cleveland Cavaliers and Buffalo Braves (now Los Angeles Clippers ), the Trail Blazers entered the NBA in 1970 as an expansion team, under coach Rolland Todd . Geoff Petrie and Sidney Wicks led the team in its early years, and the team failed to qualify for the playoffs in their first six years of existence. During that span, the team had three head coaches (including future hall-of-famer Lenny Wilkens ); team executive Stu Inman also served as coach.  The team won the first pick in the NBA draft twice during that span. In 1972, the team drafted LaRue Martin with the number one pick, and in 1974 the team selected Bill Walton from UCLA . , In 1976, the ABA–NBA merger saw those two rival leagues join forces. Four ABA teams joined the NBA; the remaining teams were dissolved and their players distributed among the remaining NBA squads in a dispersal draft . The Trail Blazers selected Maurice Lucas in the dispersal draft.  That summer, they also hired Jack Ramsay as head coach. , The two moves, coupled with the team's stellar play, led Portland to several firsts: winning record (49–33), playoff appearance, and NBA Championship in 1977 .  Starting on April 5 of that year, the team began a sellout streak of 814 straight games—the longest in American major professional sports history—which did not end until 1995, after the team moved into a larger facility .  , The team started the 1977–78 season with a 50–10 mark, and some predicted a dynasty in Portland.  However, Bill Walton suffered a foot injury that ended his season and would plague him over the remainder of his career, and the team struggled to an 8–14 finish, going 58–24 overall. In the playoffs, Portland lost to the Seattle SuperSonics in the 1978 conference semifinals.  That summer, Walton demanded to be traded to a team of his choice ( Clippers , Knicks , Warriors , or 76ers ) because he was unhappy with his medical treatment in Portland.  Walton was never traded, and he held out the entire 1978–79 season and left the team as a free agent thereafter.  The team was further dismantled as Lucas left in 1980.  , During the 1980s, the team was a consistent presence in the NBA post-season, failing to qualify for the playoffs only in 1982. However, they never advanced past the conference semifinals during the decade.  The Pacific Division of the NBA was dominated by the Los Angeles Lakers throughout the decade, and only the Lakers and the Houston Rockets represented the Western Conference in the NBA Finals. Key players for the Blazers during the early 1980s included Mychal Thompson , Billy Ray Bates , Fat Lever , Darnell Valentine , Wayne Cooper , T. R. Dunn , Jim Paxson , and Calvin Natt . , In the 1983 draft , the team selected University of Houston guard–forward Clyde Drexler with the 14th pick;  "Clyde the Glide" would become the face of the franchise for over a decade, and the team's second-most decorated player (after Walton).  In the next year's draft , the Trail Blazers landed the No. 2 pick in the NBA draft. After the Houston Rockets selected Drexler's college teammate Hakeem Olajuwon , known at that time as Akeem Olajuwon, at No. 1, the Trail Blazers selected Kentucky center Sam Bowie . Drafting third, the Chicago Bulls selected Michael Jordan . Many sportswriters and analysts have criticized the selection of the injury-plagued Bowie over Jordan as the worst draft pick in the history of American professional sports.   That summer, the Blazers also made a controversial trade, sending Lever, Cooper, and Natt to the Denver Nuggets for high-scoring forward Kiki Vandeweghe .  In the 1985 draft , the Blazers selected point guard Terry Porter with the last pick of the first round. Porter would go on to become one of the top point guards in the league, and the Blazers' all-time leader in assists. , However, the Blazers continued to struggle in the post-season, and in 1986, Ramsay was fired and replaced with Mike Schuler . Despite this, they were the only team to beat the Boston Celtics on the road that season.  That off-season, the team drafted two players from behind the Iron Curtain , Arvydas Sabonis and Dražen Petrović ,  and sent Thompson to the San Antonio Spurs for former Oregon State University star Steve Johnson . Johnson was a high-scoring forward-center who the team intended to pair with Bowie on the frontline. It was not to be, as Bowie broke his leg five games into the 1986–87 season , missing the next two and a half seasons.   During Schuler's brief tenure, the Blazers failed to advance out of the first round of the NBA playoffs.  , In 1988, Paul Allen purchased the Blazers.  His first season as owner was one marked by turmoil, as conflicts erupted over who should start at several positions. Both Vandeweghe and Johnson suffered injuries; they were replaced in the starting lineup by Jerome Kersey and Kevin Duckworth . Several players, most notably Drexler, were accused of undermining Schuler.  The team went 25–22 to open the 1988–89 season, and Schuler was fired. He was replaced on an interim basis with assistant coach Rick Adelman ,  and Vandeweghe was traded to the New York Knicks .  Under Adelman, the team went 14–21 to finish the season, and barely qualified for the playoffs. That off-season, the team traded Sam Bowie (who had returned to the team to end the season) to the New Jersey Nets for forward Buck Williams , and Adelman was given the coaching job on a non-interim basis.  , The addition of Williams, and the replacement of the defensively challenged Vandeweghe with the defensive-minded Kersey, turned the team from a poor defensive squad into a good one.  Led by Drexler, the team reached the NBA Finals in 1990 and 1992 , losing to the Detroit Pistons and Chicago Bulls , respectively. Possibly inspired by the 1985 Chicago Bears 's " Super Bowl Shuffle ", during the run-up to their 1990 Finals appearance, the Blazers recorded two songs: "Bust a Bucket" and "Rip City Rhapsody" ( with music played and recorded by Josh Mellicker, "Rip City" being a reference to the city's nickname). The year in between their two finals appearances, the team posted a league-best 63–19 record before losing to the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference finals. However, the team failed to win an NBA title, and failed to advance past the first round in 1993 and 1994 .  Adelman was fired after the 1994 season,  and replaced with P. J. Carlesimo ,  which led to the resignation of executive vice-president Geoff Petrie , a close friend of Adelman's.  , In July 1994, the Trail Blazers announced the hiring of a new team president, former Seattle SuperSonics general manager Bob Whitsitt .  Whitsitt, known as "Trader Bob" for his penchant for making trades,  immediately set about revamping the Blazers roster; this included dismantling the aging Drexler-led team that had twice been to the finals.  Drexler requested to be traded to a contender, and the Trail Blazers traded him to the Houston Rockets .  In the fall of 1995, the team left the Memorial Coliseum for a new home, the 20,000-seat Rose Garden .  The sellout streak ended in the new building.  , Several players left in free agency, including Terry Porter (1995), Buck Williams (1996), and Cliff Robinson (1997),  which left Jerome Kersey unprotected in the 1995 expansion draft .  , In an effort to rebuild, the team acquired several players who were highly talented, but had reputations for off-court troubles. Isaiah Rider , who was traded by the Minnesota Timberwolves for a draft pick and career backups due to his frequent arrests and lack of punctuality,  was arrested for cannabis possession two days before his debut with the Blazers.  Rasheed Wallace , who was acknowledged as a hot-tempered player since college,  was also acquired, in a trade with the Washington Bullets .  Point guard Kenny Anderson was signed as a free agent,  and subsequently traded to the Toronto Raptors for Damon Stoudamire in February 1998 (the Raptors traded Anderson to the Boston Celtics five days later, because he did not want to play in Canada ).  Initially, this approach worked, as the team returned to the Western Conference finals in 1999 under head coach Mike Dunleavy .  After being swept by the eventual champion San Antonio Spurs , Whitsitt sent Rider and guard Jim Jackson to the Atlanta Hawks for guard Steve Smith and acquired former All-Star forward Scottie Pippen from the Houston Rockets. The team again advanced to the Western Conference Finals, where they faced a Los Angeles Lakers team led by Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant . In that series, the Trail Blazers dropped three out of the first four games before winning the next two, forcing a pivotal Game 7 . The Blazers had a 15-point lead in the fourth quarter, but lost the game and the series to the Lakers, who went on to win the first of three consecutive titles.  , The Trail Blazers made a series of personnel moves in the 2000 and 2001 off-seasons that failed to produce the desired results. Forward Jermaine O'Neal was traded to the Indiana Pacers for Dale Davis . Brian Grant signed with the Miami Heat , and was replaced with ex-Seattle forward Shawn Kemp .  The team started off well, posting the Western Conference's best record through March 2001, and then signed guard Rod Strickland to augment their point guard corps.  The move backfired, and the team lost 17 of its remaining 25 games, and was eliminated in the first round of the playoffs (swept by the Los Angeles Lakers).  Some in the media began to criticize the team,  and Whitsitt, previously proclaimed a genius for his work in both Seattle and Portland, was criticized.  A particular criticism was that Whitsitt was attempting to win a title by assembling a roster of stars, without paying attention to team chemistry.  Longtime NBA coach and analyst, Doug Collins , referred to Whitsitt as a " rotisserie-league manager."  A fan was ejected from the Rose Garden for holding up a banner that said "Trade Whitsitt",  and many in the national media started referring to the team as the "Jail Blazers" because of many players' off-court problems.    , That offseason the churning continued; Dunleavy was fired,  and replaced with Maurice Cheeks , a "players' coach" who some thought would relate better to the players than Dunleavy did.  More transactions followed as the Blazers traded Steve Smith to the Spurs for Derek Anderson .  In one of his most controversial moves to that time, Whitsitt signed free agent Ruben Patterson , who had previously pleaded no contest to a felony sexual assault charge and was required to register as a sex offender.  Popular center, Arvydas Sabonis , who had a towel flung in his face by Rasheed Wallace during the playoffs,  decided to leave the team.  , The next two seasons were just as disastrous for the team's reputation. Several players, including Wallace, Stoudamire, and Qyntel Woods , were cited for marijuana possession.  Woods pled guilty to first-degree animal abuse for staging dog fights in his house, some involving his pit bull named Hollywood. Hollywood and Woods' other pit bull, Sugar, were confiscated, and Woods was given eighty hours of community service. He also agreed to donate $10,000 to the Oregon Humane Society.  Wallace was suspended for seven games for threatening a referee.  Zach Randolph and Patterson got in a fight during practice, with Randolph sucker punching his teammate in the eye, an injury which kept Patterson from making a meaningful contribution during the playoffs.  When police came to Stoudamire's house to respond to a burglar alarm, they noticed the smell of marijuana, searched the premises, and found a pound of cannabis located in a crawlspace;  the search was later declared illegal and charges in the matter were dropped.  Guard Bonzi Wells famously told Sports Illustrated in a 2002 interview: “We’re not really going to worry about what the hell (the fans) think about us. They really don’t matter to us. They can boo us everyday, but they’re still going to ask for our autographs if they see us on the street. That’s why they’re fans, and we’re NBA players.” Wells was fined $50,000 by the Blazers for the statement.  , Fan discontent soared; despite the team continuing to post a winning record, attendance at the Rose Garden started to decline.  In the summer of 2003, with attendance declining, the team going nowhere on the court, and an exorbitant payroll, Whitsitt announced that he would leave the team to focus on Paul Allen's other franchise, the Seattle Seahawks .  , To replace Whitsitt, the team hired two men at new positions. John Nash , a veteran NBA executive, was hired as general manager,  and Steve Patterson as team president.  The new management promised a focus on character while remaining playoff contenders; the team soon published a "Twenty-Five Point Pledge" to fans.  Troublesome players including Wells, Wallace, and Jeff McInnis were traded.  However, the team failed to qualify for the 2004 NBA Playoffs , ending a streak of 21 straight appearances.  , The following year was marked by more trouble as the team plummeted to a 27–55 record. The bankruptcy of the Oregon Arena corporation , which resulted in the Rose Garden being owned by a consortium of investment firms, further alienated the fanbase, as did an incident in which forward Darius Miles (himself African-American) called coach Maurice Cheeks a " nigger ", following it up with more racial invective when Cheeks sought out Nash, referring to Nash as Cheeks' "daddy."  The latter incident was compounded by what many viewed as inadequate discipline for Miles, followed by a secret agreement between the team and Miles to refund the amount of his fine.  Cheeks was fired that season and replaced on an interim basis by director of player-personnel Kevin Pritchard .  That summer the team hired Nate McMillan , who had coached the Sonics the prior season,  and Pritchard returned to the front office. , The following 2005–06 season was not better, as the Blazers posted a league-worst 21–61 record.  Attendance was lower, and the year was not free of player incidents. Players such as Miles, Patterson, Randolph, and Sebastian Telfair were involved in either on-court bickering or off-court legal incidents.  Nash was fired at the end of the season, with Steve Patterson assuming the general manager role in addition to his duties as president.  In addition, the team had a poor relationship with the management of the Rose Garden, frequently complaining of a "broken economic model."  It was widely speculated by the end of the year that Paul Allen would sell the team, and the team was offered for sale that summer, with several groups expressing interest.  However, Allen was willing to spend money and urged Pritchard to make draft-day trades. He subsequently took the team off the market.  , In the 2006 NBA draft the Blazers traded Viktor Khryapa and draft rights for Tyrus Thomas for draft rights to LaMarcus Aldridge . The Blazers also traded for the sixth pick, Brandon Roy . In the spring of 2007, Steve Patterson resigned as team president,  and Paul Allen entered into an agreement to re-purchase the Rose Garden.  On the court, the team finished with a 32–50 record, an 11-game improvement, and rookie shooting guard Roy was named the 2006–07 Rookie of the Year.  That summer Pritchard was promoted to general manager,  and former Nike Inc. executive Larry Miller was hired as team president. The Blazers won the 2007 NBA draft lottery and selected Ohio State center Greg Oden with the No. 1 pick in the draft. Some had speculated that they might choose Kevin Durant instead;  Durant was picked at No. 2 by regional rivals the Seattle SuperSonics . Oden suffered a pre-season knee injury requiring microfracture surgery, and missed the entire 2007–08 season.  Oden's constant battle with injuries and Durant's success resulted in comparisons to the Blazers' selection of Sam Bowie over Michael Jordan in 1984.  , Despite this, the Trail Blazers had a 13-game winning streak that began in early December, resulting in a 13–2 record, an NBA best for the month of December. Nate McMillan won NBA Coach of the Month honors, and Roy garnered NBA Western Conference Player of the Week honors in back-to-back weeks (the first Trail Blazer to accomplish the feat since Clyde Drexler in the 1990–91 season). Western Conference head coaches selected Roy to the 2008 NBA All-Star Game , the first All-Star for the Blazers since Rasheed Wallace in 2001 .  The Blazers finished the season 41–41, their best record since the 2003–04 season. , During the 2008–09 season, after much waiting, Greg Oden debuted with the Blazers, playing in 61 games. Portland also added some international flavor to the team with the arrival of Spanish swingman Rudy Fernández , a member of the Spanish national basketball team . French-native Nicolas Batum emerged as a skilled defensive forward who was inserted into the starting lineup as a rookie. Roy appeared in his second-straight All-Star Game , and Fernández competed in the Sprite Slam Dunk Contest during NBA All-Star Weekend. Roy had a career-high 52 points against the Phoenix Suns and game-winning shots against the Houston Rockets and New York Knicks .     The Blazers clinched a playoff berth for the first time since 2003 and achieved a 54–28 record, their first winning record since the 2002–03 season.  As the fourth seed and holding home court advantage, the Trail Blazers played the fifth-seeded Houston Rockets in the 2009 Playoffs , losing the playoff series 4 games to 2. , In the 2009 off-season, the Trail Blazers traded the No. 24 pick to Dallas for the No. 22 pick and selected Victor Claver . They also selected Villanova forward Dante Cunningham with the No. 33 pick, Jon Brockman and guard Patrick Mills . Brockman was traded to the Kings in exchange for No. 31 pick Jeff Pendergraph . Free agent Channing Frye signed with the Phoenix Suns and Sergio Rodríguez was traded to the Kings. The Blazers attempted to sign free agent small forward Hedo Türkoğlu , who led the Orlando Magic to the 2009 NBA Finals , but after a verbal agreement he decided to sign with the Toronto Raptors . The Blazers then attempted to sign restricted free agent Paul Millsap ; however, their offer was matched by the Utah Jazz. On July 24, 2009, the Trail Blazers signed point guard Andre Miller . , Despite a winning record, injuries hobbled the team for the 2009-2010 season. Reserves Batum and Fernández started the season on the inactive list and forward Travis Outlaw soon followed after a serious foot injury early in the season. Most notably, centers Oden and Joel Przybilla suffered season-ending knee injuries, while Roy and Aldridge played through shoulder, hamstring, ankle and knee injuries. Head Coach Nate McMillan was likewise not spared, suffering a ruptured Achilles tendon during practice and was in a walking boot. Because of the void at the center position, Blazers general manager Kevin Pritchard worked out a deal to acquire Marcus Camby from the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for Steve Blake and Outlaw. Although wins did not come as easily as the season before, the Blazers rallied to finish at 50–32, and finished 6th in the West. Roy underwent surgery after suffering a torn meniscus in his right knee, but returned for Game 4 of the first round series against the Phoenix Suns .  However, the accumulation of injuries was too much to bear, and the short-handed Trail Blazers lost the series 4–2 to the Suns.  , During the 2010 off-season, the Blazers' front office experienced significant personnel changes beginning in July with the announcement of new general manager Rich Cho , succeeding former general manager Kevin Pritchard , who was relieved of his duties after the 2010 NBA draft . Cho became the first general manager of Asian descent in NBA history.  On August 12, the Trail Blazers signed two new assistant general managers, Bill Branch and Steve Rosenberry. Branch and Rosenberry replaced former assistant general manager Tom Penn, who was released by Portland in March.  The organization also made changes to Nate McMillan 's coaching staff by hiring Bernie Bickerstaff , Bob Ociepka and Buck Williams , with Bickerstaff assuming the lead assistant coach position due to the departure of Monty Williams .  The Blazers acquired rookies Armon Johnson , Luke Babbitt , and Elliot Williams from the 2010 NBA draft and off-season trades. On July 21, Wesley Matthews signed a five-year deal with the Blazers after his former team, the Utah Jazz , declined to match Portland's offer.  , Similar to the previous season, Portland was overcome with injuries from the start of the 2010–11 season. Jeff Pendergraph and rookie guard Elliot Williams both suffered knee injuries that sidelined them for the season; Portland later waived Pendergraph. In November, they announced that Oden would have microfracture surgery on his left knee, ending his 2010–2011 season.  This injury marked Oden's third NBA season cut short due to a knee injury. Three-time All-Star Brandon Roy underwent double-arthroscopic surgery on January 17, 2011, to repair both knees after dealing with constant struggles, leaving his future up in the air. Just days after, Marcus Camby also underwent arthroscopic knee surgery to repair his left knee. , Despite struggles with injury, Portland performed at a playoff level throughout the season. LaMarcus Aldridge emerged as the focal point of the team and posted career-high numbers, as well as Western Conference Player of the Week and Month honors. Wesley Matthews also emerged in the absence of Brandon Roy, proving his worth as the Blazers' key off-season addition. Believing the team could make a significant run in the playoffs, Cho executed his first major trade on February 24, 2011, just seven minutes before the deadline. The Trail Blazers sent forward Dante Cunningham , center Joel Przybilla and center Sean Marks to the Charlotte Bobcats in return for former All-Star and All-Defensive forward Gerald Wallace .  The emergence of Aldridge and the play of Matthews kept the Blazers competitive, sealing another playoff berth by winning 48 games. However, like in their last two postseasons, the Blazers were eliminated in six games of the first round, this time against the eventual champions, the Dallas Mavericks. , During the 2011 off-season, the Blazers released Cho, reportedly due to communication and "chemistry issues" with owner Paul Allen . Director of Scouting Chad Buchanan took over as acting interim General Manager. The dismissal of Cho was criticized by Sports Illustrated as "illogical", although they noted that Allen had done a lot of questionable moves during his tenure as team owner.  , On June 23, 2011, in the NBA draft, the Trail Blazers drafted guards Nolan Smith from Duke University with the 21st selection and Jon Diebler from Ohio State University with the 51st selection. On the same day, the Blazers front office had made a three-team trade with the Denver Nuggets and Dallas Mavericks . The trade sent Blazers guards Andre Miller to Denver and Rudy Fernández to Dallas along with international player Petteri Koponen , who had yet to make an appearance for Portland; Denver then sent guard Raymond Felton to Portland and Denver also received rookie forward Jordan Hamilton from Dallas as well as a future second-round pick from Portland.  , A lockout put transactions on hold until early December, and the Blazers were hit with three downfalls once the date came: Brandon Roy announced his retirement due to chronic knee problems, Greg Oden was diagnosed with yet another setback involving his ongoing knee issues, and LaMarcus Aldridge underwent heart surgery.  Interim GM Chad Buchanan signed three free agents in the week before Portland's first exhibition game: Kurt Thomas , Jamal Crawford and Craig Smith .  , In the shortened 2011–12 NBA season , the Blazers got off to a 7–2 start.  But the team quickly began to collapse, as starting point guard Raymond Felton , among others, struggled with McMillan's new approach to a running-style offense. The team gained some notability as Aldridge was named to his first All-Star Game. Despite Aldridge's performance, the rest of the team became more inconsistent. , On March 15, 2012, the Trail Blazers made several moves, including two trades before the 3 pm EST deadline. Center Marcus Camby was sent to the Houston Rockets in exchange for center Hasheem Thabeet and point guard Jonny Flynn . Portland also received Houston's second-round draft pick in the 2012 NBA draft. Portland then traded forward Gerald Wallace to the New Jersey Nets for center Mehmet Okur , forward Shawne Williams , and New Jersey's first-round, top-3-protected pick in the 2012 NBA draft. All four players acquired in the trades held expiring contracts, meaning they would be free agents at the end of the season. Oden was released from the roster after playing a total of 82 games in five NBA seasons, being cut along with Chris Johnson in order to make room for the incoming traded players. Finally, head coach Nate McMillan was also fired, leaving the franchise with the third-most coaching wins, behind Jack Ramsay and Rick Adelman . Portland named Kaleb Canales as the interim head coach for the rest of the 2011–2012 NBA season. A few days later, Portland claimed forward J. J. Hickson off waivers from the Sacramento Kings . After shaking up the roster and limping to the end of the regular season with a 28–38 record and finishing out of playoff contention for the first time in three years, the team entered the offseason on the search for a general manager and new head coach. , At the 2012 NBA draft lottery on May 30, the Blazers secured the number 6 pick of the draft via the Brooklyn Nets from the Gerald Wallace trade, and also ended up with the number 11 pick due to their own record. Neil Olshey became the new GM in June, making it just over a year since the Blazers had a non-interim general manager.  , On June 28, 2012, the Blazers selected Weber State guard Damian Lillard and University of Illinois center Meyers Leonard with the 6th and 11th picks overall, respectively. They also selected University of Memphis guard Will Barton with the 40th pick overall, and traded the rights of the 41st overall pick, University of Kansas guard Tyshawn Taylor , to the Brooklyn Nets for cash considerations. , Headed by their new general manager Olshey, the Trail Blazers front office further made a few changes during July 2012. The Blazers signed their 30th pick from the 2006 draft, Joel Freeland , and their 22nd pick from the 2009 draft, Victor Claver ,  as well as re-signing Hickson  and Nicolas Batum .  They also signed veteran point guard Ronnie Price to back up Lillard, who was selected as co-MVP of the 2012 Las Vegas Summer League.  Dallas Mavericks assistant coach Terry Stotts was hired as head coach on August 7, 2012.  , Under the reins of Lillard, the Blazers played well into January 2013, posting a 20–15 record. On January 11, 2013, at home against the Miami Heat , Wesley Matthews made two consecutive three-pointers late in the fourth quarter to help the Blazers secure a 92–90 victory.  However, despite the Blazers remaining among the playoff contenders for most of the season, injuries to starters Batum, LaMarcus Aldridge , and Matthews, as well as a losing streak of 13 games – the longest in the franchise's history – led to the 11th position in the West, with a 33–49 record.  Averaging 19.0 points, 6.5 assists, and 3.1 rebounds, Lillard was unanimously named Rookie of the Year, joining Ralph Sampson , David Robinson , and Blake Griffin as the only unanimous selections in NBA history.  , Going into the 2013 NBA draft , the Trail Blazers held four picks, with the 10th pick in the first round and three second-round picks. The Blazers selected guard C. J. McCollum out of Lehigh University with their 10th pick, and also selected center Jeff Withey from Kansas , power forward Grant Jerrett from Arizona , and Montenegrin big man Marko Todorović .  In addition, Cal guard Allen Crabbe was acquired from the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for two second-round picks, in the 2015 and 2016 drafts.  , The Blazers finished the 2014 season with 21 more wins than the previous season, which amounted for the largest single-season improvement in franchise history.  This included a period in November where they won 11 straight games, and 13-2 in the month overall, for which Coach Terry Stotts took home Coach of the Month honors.  On December 12, 2013, Aldridge scored 31 points and pulled down 25 rebounds in a home game against the Rockets , the first time a Trail Blazer recorded a 30-point, 25-rebound game.  On December 14, 2013, the Blazers made a franchise-record 21 three pointers against the Philadelphia 76ers .  They tied the new record 19 days later against the Charlotte Bobcats, becoming the first NBA team to make 20 or more three pointers in a game more than once in a season.  Lillard was voted in as a reserve to his first All-Star game, joining Aldridge to represent Portland at the game.  Portland finished 54-28, securing the fifth seed in the playoffs against the Houston Rockets . The team also shot 81.5% at the free throw line, made 770 three pointers, and started four players for all 82 regular season games, all franchise records. , The first-round series against the Rockets was a tight one, with three of the six games going to overtime. The Blazers fared well in the first two games despite not having home-court advantage, beating Houston 122–120 and 112-105 in Games 1 and 2 respectively, fueled by Aldridge's 46 points and 18 rebounds in Game 1, and 43 points and 3 blocks in Game 2. The biggest headline came in the sixth game of the series with the Rockets threatening to force a Game 7 back at Houston. Down two points with 0.9 seconds left in the game, Damian Lillard hit a buzzer-beating three-pointer to close out the series, and the Blazers advanced to the semifinals for the first time since 2000, where they lost to the eventual champion San Antonio Spurs in 5 games.  , With a record of 51–31, the Blazers clinched a return trip to the playoffs the following year on March 30, 2015, defeating the Phoenix Suns, 109–86. They clinched their first Northwest Division title since 1999, but fell to the Grizzlies in five games in the first round of the playoffs. , In the Blazers' 44 years of existence (through 2014), they have qualified for the NBA playoffs 30 times, including a streak of 21 straight playoff appearances from 1983 through 2003. The team has one NBA title, in 1977, and appeared in the NBA Finals two other times, in 1990 and 1992. The best record posted by the team was 63–19, in 1991; the worst record was 18–64, in the team's second season. , The following players have rights owned by the Portland Trail Blazers. ,  , 1 Ramsay did not play for the team; the number represents the 1977 NBA Championship he won while coaching the Blazers. , Players : , Coaches : , Bold denotes still active with team.

In 1972 the choice was LaRue Martin , Bill Walton was picked in 1974, Mychal Thompson in 1978, and Greg Oden was taken in 2007. Several Blazer picks have been criticized by NBA commentators as particularly unwise:  , In the 1990s, the Blazers selected Jermaine O'Neal and in the modern millennium drafted Zach Randolph and, in 2006, acquired Brandon Roy and LaMarcus Aldridge in a draft day that included six trades involving the Trail Blazers. , The team's colors are red, white, black, and silver, which was added in 2002.  The team's " pinwheel " logo, originally designed by the cousin of Glickman, is a graphic interpretation of two five-on-five basketball teams lined up against each other. One side of the pinwheel is red; the other side is silver (formerly black or white).  The logo has gone from a vertical alignment to a slanted one starting in the 1991 season, creating a straight edge along the top  , Portland's home uniforms are white in color, with red, black, and silver accents; the primary road uniform is black, with red, white, and silver accents. The alternate road uniform is red with white, silver, and black accents.  From 1970 to the 1977–78 season , the team wore red road uniforms, switching to black in that year, with a switch from horizontal lettering with the tail added on the last letter to vertical lettering midway through its lifespan. The team again wore red from 1979 to 1985, switching back to black road jerseys after that. In 2002, the team reintroduced red jerseys. The team's uniforms have remained nearly the same since the 1977–78 season, featuring a "blaze" strip diagonal down the jersey and into the shorts. Notable alterations include the change from lowercase lettering to uppercase in 1991–92 , tapered ends on the letters and silver trim in 2002–03 , and the return of the city name to the black road jerseys in 2006–07 . In the 2009–10 NBA season they introduced a special jersey commemorating the Blazers' "Rip City" nickname, borrowing elements from their old and current logos. For the 2012–13 NBA season , the red jerseys were slightly altered, featuring a straightened "Portland" script and black lettering with silver trim, along with a modified "blaze" striping, "Rip City" shorts script and pinwheel logo in front of the uniform.  , The team's mascot is Blaze the Trail Cat, a two-tone silver-colored mountain lion ,  which has been the team's official mascot since 2002.  Prior to Blaze's debut, the Trail Blazers never had any official mascot. A popular unofficial mascot was the late Bill "The Beerman" Scott, a Seattle beer vendor/cheerleader who worked for numerous pro teams, including the Trail Blazers, the Seattle Seahawks , and the Seattle Mariners . Scott worked for the Trail Blazers from 1981 through 1985.  , The team is owned by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen ; ownership of the Trail Blazers is via a series of holding companies which Allen owns. Vulcan Inc. is a private corporation in which Allen is the chairman and sole shareholder. A subsidiary of Vulcan, Vulcan Sports and Entertainment (VSE), manages Allen's sports-related properties, including the Trail Blazers, the Seattle Seahawks NFL team, the Seattle Sounders MLS team, and the Moda Center. In the fall of 2012, Peter McLoughlin was named CEO of Vulcan Sports and Entertainment. , The Trail Blazers as a corporate entity are owned by VSE. Allen serves as the team's chairman, and his longtime associate Bert Kolde is vice-chairman. The position of president and chief executive officer is held by Chris McGowan,  with Larry Miller having held the job until resigning in July 2012.  The post of chief operating officer is vacant; the most recent COO of the team was Mike Golub , who resigned in July 2008 to take a more enhanced role with VSE.   Kevin Pritchard served as general manager of the Trail Blazers until he was fired on June 24, 2010. The announcement was issued by the Blazers' head office just an hour before the beginning of the 2010 NBA draft .   A month later, the Blazers named Oklahoma City Thunder assistant general manager Rich Cho as their new general manager.  Cho was fired less than a year later, and director of college scouting Chad Buchanan served as interim general manager for the entire 2011–12 season. In June 2012, the Trail Blazers hired Neil Olshey as general manager.  , Before Allen purchased the team in 1988, the Trail Blazers were owned by a group of investors headed by Larry Weinberg , who is chairman emeritus.  , The Trail Blazers play their home games in the Moda Center, a multipurpose arena which is located in Portland's Rose Quarter , northeast of downtown. The Moda Center, originally named the Rose Garden, opened in 1995 and can seat a total of 19,980 spectators for basketball games; capacity increases to 20,580 with standing room .  Like the Trail Blazers, the Moda Center is owned by Paul Allen through subsidiary Vulcan Sports and Entertainment ,  and the arena is managed by Global Spectrum .  During a two-year period between 2005 and 2007, the arena was owned by a consortium of creditors who financed its construction after the Oregon Arena Corporation, a now-defunct holding company owned by Allen, filed for bankruptcy in 2004 .  In August 2013, the arena's name was changed from the Rose Garden to the Moda Center, after the Blazers' front office officials reached a 4-million-dollar agreement with Moda Health Corporation. The name change was met with considerable criticism from fans.  , Prior to 1995, the Trail Blazers home venue was the Memorial Coliseum , which today stands adjacent to the Moda Center. This facility, built in 1960, can seat 12,888 spectators for basketball.  It was renamed the Veterans Memorial Coliseum in 2011. , The team has a cheerleading-dance squad known as the BlazerDancers. Consisting of 16 members, the all-female BlazerDancers perform dance routines at home games, charity events, and promotional events. The 2008–2009 team held auditions in late July 2008. Seven new dancers, as well as nine returning dancers made up the new team.  A junior dance team composed of 8- to 11-year-old girls also performs at selected home games,  as does a hip hop dance troupe.  Other regular in-game entertainment acts include a co-educational acrobatic stunt team which performs technically difficult cheers,  a break dancing squad known as the Portland TrailBreakers,  and a pair of percussion acts.   , The relationship between the team and its fans, commonly known as "Blazermania", has been well-chronicled. The Trail Blazers have long been one of the NBA's top draws, with the exception of two periods in the team's history. The team drew poorly during its first four seasons of existence, failing to average more than 10,000 spectators per game. Attendance increased in 1974, when the team drafted Bill Walton .  , The phenomenon known as Blazermania started during the 1976–77 season, when the team posted its first winning record, made its first playoff appearance, and captured its only NBA title, defeating the heavily favored Philadelphia 76ers in the NBA Finals; the team has been popular in Portland since that time.   That season, the team started a sellout streak which continued until the team moved into the Rose Garden in 1995.  The team continued to average over 19,000 spectators per game until the 2003–04 season, when attendance declined after the team continued to suffer image problems due to the "Jail Blazer" reputation it had gained, and was no longer as competitive on the court.  After drafting eventual Rookie of the Year and three-time All Star Brandon Roy in 2006, attendance climbed in the 2006–07 season and continued to rebound in the 2007–08 season. The final 27 home games of the 2007–2008 season were consecutive sell-outs, a streak which continued through the entire 2008–2009 season and into the start of the 2011–2012 season. [ citation needed ] , Like all NBA franchises, games of the Trail Blazers are routinely broadcast via television and radio. The team was one of the first in the NBA to produce its own television broadcasts.  The team's television production facility is known as Post-Up Productions. Television broadcasts of Blazer games, when not carried on a national network, are broadcast either on Comcast SportsNet Northwest or the Blazers Television Network, a network of five over-the-air television stations (four in Oregon; one in Washington).  The flagship station of the Blazers Television Network is KGW-TV in Portland.  , For the 2007–08 season , all but six regular-season games were carried on one these networks; the other six were broadcast nationally on TNT or ESPN . Thirty-four games were produced and broadcast in high-definition television .  The Trail Blazers television play-by-play announcer and analyst are Mike Barrett and Mike Rice , respectively. The sideline reporter during the broadcasts is Michael Holton , following Terry Porter (2010–11)  and Rebecca Haarlow (2009–10). The team was also known for its long association with Steve "Snapper" Jones , who played for the team prior to his career as a television analyst; Jones departed the franchise in 2005.  , All Trail Blazer games are broadcast over the radio, with broadcasting carried on the Trail Blazers radio network, which consists of 25 stations located in the Pacific Northwest . The flagship station of the Blazers' radio network is Fox Sports 620 KPOJ , the AM sports talk radio station in Portland. The radio broadcasting team consists of play-by-play announcer Brian Wheeler , analyst Antonio Harvey , and studio host Jay Allen.   All games are preceded by a pre-game analysis show, Blazers Courtside , and followed by a post-game show known as The 5th Quarter .  Bob Akamian served as studio host until halfway through the 2010–2011 season, when the team hired away Adam Bjaranson from their over-the-air TV partner, KGW, and former Trail Blazers' player Michael Holton is the studio analyst. The original radio announcer for the team was Bill Schonely , who served as the team's radio play-by-play announcer from 1970 until his retirement in 1998—calling 2,522 Blazers games—and remains with the team as a community ambassador.  , Trail Blazers broadcasts have been criticized on several fronts. The broadcast personalities, all of whom are Trail Blazers employees, have been criticized in the media for being " homers "; further it has been alleged that the 2005 departure of Steve Jones was due in part to team displeasure with Jones' sometimes frank analysis of the team's on-court performance and off-court decisions.  A television deal signed with Comcast SportsNet in 2007 has also been criticized for not ensuring access to Blazer games, as well as satellite television providers such as DirecTV and Dish Network , both of which compete with Comcast's cable television operations.  , Several local news outlets provide in-depth coverage of the Trail Blazers. Chief among them is The Oregonian , the largest paper in the state of Oregon. Other newspapers providing detailed coverage of the team (including the assignment of beat writers to cover the team) include the Portland Tribune , a weekly Portland paper, and the Vancouver, Washington Columbian . Notable local journalists to cover the team include John Canzano and Jason Quick of the Oregonian and Dwight Jaynes of the Portland Tribune . Online coverage of the Oregonian is provided through OregonLive.com ,  a website collaboration between the paper and Advance Internet .  In addition to making Oregonian content available, oregonlive.com hosts several blogs covering the team written by Oregonian journalists,   as well as an additional blog, "Blazers Blog", written by Sean Meagher.  , Relations between the team and The Oregonian have often been tense; the paper is editorially independent of the team and is often critical. During the Steve Patterson era, relations between the two institutions became increasingly hostile; several NBA executives told ESPN 's Chris Sheridan that the situation was the "most dysfunctional media-team relationship" that they could recall.  For instance during a portion of a pre- 2006 NBA draft workout, which was closed to the media, an Oregonian reporter looked through a curtain separating the press from the workout and wrote about this on his blog.  Outraged, the team closed subsequent practices to the press altogether,  leading John Canzano of the paper to respond with outrage on his blog.  In November 2006, the Oregonian commissioned an outside editor to investigate the deteriorating relationship,  a move the rival Willamette Week called "unusual".  In the report,  both sides were criticized somewhat, but did not make any revelations which were unexpected.  , Additional coverage is offered by various blogs, including Blazers Edge (part of SB Nation ) and The Portland Roundball Society (part of ESPN's TrueHoop Network).  The Utah Jazz are an American professional basketball team based in Salt Lake City , Utah . They are a part of the Northwest Division in the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The team began in 1974 as the New Orleans Jazz in New Orleans , Louisiana ; the team moved to Salt Lake City in 1979. , The Jazz were one of the least successful teams in the league in their early years. Although it took the Jazz 10 years before they made a playoff appearance (in 1984 ), they would not miss the playoffs again until 2004. During the late 1980s, John Stockton and Karl Malone arose as the franchise players for the team, and formed one of the most famed point guard – power forward duos in NBA history. Led by coach Jerry Sloan , who took over for Frank Layden in 1988, they became one of the powerhouse teams of the 1990s, culminating in two NBA Finals appearances in 1997 and 1998 , where they lost both times to the Chicago Bulls , led by Michael Jordan . , Both Stockton and Malone moved on in 2003. After missing the playoffs for three consecutive seasons the Jazz returned to prominence under the on-court leadership of point guard Deron Williams . However, partway through the 2010–11 NBA season , the Jazz began restructuring after Sloan's retirement and Williams' trade to the New Jersey Nets . The team has made the playoffs since then: in 2012 under coach Tyrone Corbin , and are beginning a new era under head coach Quin Snyder . , The Jazz are one of two teams in the major professional sports leagues located in the state of Utah; the other team is Real Salt Lake , a professional soccer team in Major League Soccer (MLS). , , , On June 7, 1974, the New Orleans Jazz were admitted as an expansion franchise into the NBA . Team officials selected the name because of its definition in the dictionary: collective improvisation.  The team began its inaugural season in New Orleans in the 1974–75 season . The team's first major move was to trade for star player Pete Maravich (who had played collegiately at LSU ) from the Atlanta Hawks for two first-round draft picks, three second-round picks, and one third-round pick over the next three years.  Although he was considered one of the most entertaining players in the league and won the scoring championship in 1977 with 31.1 points per game, the Jazz' best record while in New Orleans was 39–43 in the 1977–78 season . Maravich struggled with knee injuries from that season onward. , Venue issues were a continual problem for the team while in New Orleans. In the Jazz's first season, they played in the Municipal Auditorium and Loyola Field House , where the basketball court was raised so high that the players' association made the team put a net around the court so that players wouldn't fall off of the court and into the stands.  Later, they played games in the Louisiana Superdome , but things were no better due to high demand for the stadium, onerous lease terms and Maravich's constant knee problems. They also faced the prospect of spending a whole month on the road each year due to Mardi Gras festivities.   Years later, founding owner Sam D. Battistone claimed that there was no contingency plan in case the Jazz ever made the playoffs. However, the Superdome's manager at the time, Bill Curl, said that the stadium's management always submitted a list of potential playoff dates to the Jazz management, but these letters were never answered. , After what turned out to be their final season in New Orleans, they were dealt a further humiliation when the Los Angeles Lakers selected Magic Johnson with the first overall pick in the 1979 NBA draft . The pick would have been the Jazz' had they not traded it to acquire Gail Goodrich two years earlier. Also, the Jazz had given up the rights to Moses Malone in order to regain one of the three first-round picks used for the Goodrich trade; the combination of Johnson and Malone blossoming into Hall of Famers and Goodrich's ineffective, injury-ruined few years in New Orleans made this transaction one of the most lopsided in NBA history. , Despite being barely competitive, the Jazz drew well during their first five years. However, by 1979 the franchise was sinking financially. Barry Mendelson, the team's executive vice president for most of the early years, said one factor in the financial trouble was an 11 percent amusement tax, highest in the nation at the time. The team also couldn't attract much local corporate support—an important factor even in those days—or local investors. , Battistone concluded that the franchise could not be viable in New Orleans and decided to move elsewhere. After scouting several new homes, he decided to move the team to Salt Lake City, even though it was a smaller market. However, Salt Lake City had proven it could support a professional basketball team when it hosted the American Basketball Association (ABA)'s Utah Stars from 1970 to 1976.  The Stars had been extremely popular in the city and had even won an ABA title in their first season after moving from Los Angeles. However, their finances inexplicably collapsed in their last two seasons, and they were shut down by the league 16 games into the 1975-76 season after missing payroll. Although Salt Lake City was not known for its jazz culture, the team decided to keep the name, as well as the team's original colors of green, purple and gold (the colors of Mardi Gras). , The Jazz's attendance declined slightly after the team's move from New Orleans to Utah, due to a late approval for the move (June 1979) and poor marketing in the Salt Lake City area.  The team's management made the first of several moves in 1979, bringing high-scoring forward Adrian Dantley to Utah in exchange for Spencer Haywood . Dantley averaged 28.0 points per game during the 1979–80 season, allowing the team to waive Pete Maravich early in the year. The team struggled to a 24–58 mark, but was rewarded with the second overall pick in the 1980 NBA draft , which they used to pick Darrell Griffith of Louisville, another piece of the rebuilding puzzle. , During the 1980–81 NBA Season, they struggled financially as well as on the court. Despite having perennial All-Star Dantley, a 20-point per game scorer in Griffith; as well as emerging point guard Rickey Green , the Jazz were still unable to get above .500, finishing 25-57. , Tom Nissalke departed as coach after they started the 1981–82 season 8–12, and General Manager Frank Layden replaced him. Layden's coaching wasn't an improvement initially, as the Jazz went 17–45 the rest of that season to finish 25–57. , The 1982 NBA draft saw the Jazz pick Dominique Wilkins . The Jazz would have preferred to take either James Worthy or Terry Cummings , but those players went 1-2 to the Lakers and Clippers, respectively; Utah had been confident that the Lakers would take Wilkins and that would have given them a shot at either of the other top forwards (they favored Cummings over Worthy because Cummings had shown he could play both small and power forward), and Utah wasn't aware that the Lakers had researched both Worthy and Wilkins and decided on Worthy out of concern about Wilkins' perceived selfishness. Battistone's continued financial problems, combined with Wilkins making it clear he did not want to play in Utah, resulted in the Jazz sending Wilkins to Atlanta in return for John Drew and Freeman Williams. This trade, even considering the circumstances, turned out to be one of the worst trades in NBA history. Wilkins would go on to a Hall of Fame career, while Drew and Williams would only play a combined four seasons with the Jazz. , For the 1982–83 season, Dantley missed 60 of 82 games due to injury, which deprived the team of its lead scorer for much of the season. Newcomer John Drew also missed time, playing in only 44 games. The Jazz ended up being led by Darrell Griffith (22.2 points per game), Rickey Green (14.3 points per game), and Danny Schayes (12.4 points per game). A rookie 7'4" center – Mark Eaton – manned the post. The team finished 30–52, still out of the playoffs, but an improvement over recent years. , During the 1983 NBA draft , the Jazz used their first-round pick, 7th overall, to choose Thurl Bailey , and later took Bobby Hansen in the third round, 54th overall. , 1983–84 opened as a season of uncertainty. The team was losing money, and management was crafting stunts, such as playing games at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas , to help the team become more profitable.  The team was rumored to be moving due to Battistone's cash shorts, which were exacerbated by the fact they were playing in the league's smallest market. However, fortunes on the court improved, with a healthy Adrian Dantley , Jeff Wilkins , and rookie Thurl Bailey at the forward positions, Mark Eaton & Rich Kelley jointly manning the post, and Rickey Green with Darrell Griffith at the guards, and John Drew providing 17 points per night off the bench. They went 45–37 and won the Midwest Division, the first winning season and division title in team history. , They advanced to the NBA Playoffs, defeating the Denver Nuggets 3–2 in the first round, and moved on to play the Phoenix Suns in the second round. Despite having homecourt in the best of seven series, the Jazz lost to the more experienced Suns, 4–2. , Jazz fans were not happy when the team picked an unknown guard in the first round of the 1984 NBA draft , John Stockton . The Jazz fans on hand for the draft party booed the selection.  , The 1984–85 season saw the emergence of Mark Eaton as a defensive force. averaging 5.56 blocks per game along with 9.7 points and 11.3 rebounds per game, and won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award . On the downside, John Drew played only 19 games on the season, which deprived the team of their high-scoring sixth man. But, the Jazz returned to the playoffs, facing the Houston Rockets and their All-Star Centers, Hakeem Olajuwon and Ralph Sampson . The Jazz prevailed in the series, 3–2, and advanced to the second round to face the high-scoring Denver Nuggets . Utah fell to Denver, 4–1 in the second-round. , The team's perennial financial woes and instability were somewhat stabilized during April 1985, when auto dealer Larry H. Miller bought 50% of the team from Battistone for $8 million. Battistone had been seeking to move the team.  In the 1985 NBA draft the team added Karl Malone . , Malone made an immediate impact in the 1985–86 season , averaging 14.9 points and 8.9 rebounds per game, which supplemented for Dantley. However, starter Darrell Griffith missed the season with a stress fracture, and they hovered around .500 most of the year. In the 1985–86 postseason, the Jazz lost in the first round series to the Dallas Mavericks, 3–1. , During the off-season in 1986, Battistone was approached to sell the team to Marv Wolfenson and Harvey Ratner, who would have moved the team to Minneapolis . Larry Miller didn't want to sell the team, but due to contractual language in his agreement with Battistone, could have been bought out by the new owners if he refused to sell. Offers went as high as $28 million for the team as a whole during this process (the Jazz were valued at $16 million less than a year earlier when Miller purchased half for $8 million). Miller stepped in at the last minute and purchased the remaining 50% of the team for $14 million, buying out the original contract with Battistone, and kept the team in Utah.  Wolfenson and Ratner later became the founders of the Minnesota Timberwolves expansion franchise which, coincidentally, was almost sold and moved to New Orleans in 1994. , The 1986–87 season was one of change. Adrian Dantley , the team's star player who had carried them through the early years in Utah, was traded to Detroit for Kelly Tripucka , who ended up splitting time with Thurl Bailey. Darrell Griffith, back from injuries that caused him to miss the 1985–86 season, lost his starter spot at guard to Bobby Hansen. Stockton warranted more time at the point guard position. Amidst all these changes, the team went 44–38, and lost to the Golden State Warriors in the first round of the playoffs.   , For the 1987–88 Season, Stockton took over for Rickey Green as the starting point guard, and Malone established himself as one of the better power forwards in the league. The team finished 47–35 and defeated Portland, 3–1, in the first round, earning a second round matchup with the defending NBA Champion Los Angeles Lakers . After LA took Game 1 at home, the Jazz won Game 2 in LA, 101–97, and took the lead in the series 2–1 with a Game 3 win in Salt Lake City. The Jazz lost Games 4 and 5, but won Game 6, 108–80, tying the series 3–3. In the decisive Game 7, the Lakers won 109–98. The Jazz had shown they were no longer pushovers of their early days. , During the 1988–89 season, Frank Layden stepped down as head coach of the Jazz after the first 17 games, and was replaced by Jerry Sloan . The Jazz won 51 games and the Midwest Division Title as they grew better overall. Malone and Stockton, as well as Mark Eaton, were All-Stars. Eaton won Defensive Player of the Year for the second time, and it appeared the Jazz were ready to take the next step in the post-season, after having pushed the Los Angeles Lakers to seven games in the 2nd round the previous year. However, the 2 seed Jazz were upset in the first round by the 7 seed Golden State Warriors, 3 games to 0. , The following year, 1989–90, the Jazz made some changes, Bobby Hansen supplanted Darrell Griffith as a starter. Also, Thurl Bailey, relied on for 19 points per game the previous year, had a reduced, as rookie Blue Edwards played a prominent role. Mike Brown, spelled Mark Eaton more frequently. The results were the best win–loss mark in team history, going 55–27 and finishing second in the division to the San Antonio Spurs (56–26). Malone had his best season statistically, averaging 31.0 points and 11.1 rebounds. Stockton averaged 17.2 points and 14.5 assists per game, both career highs, with the assist total and average leading the NBA that season. In the playoffs, they faced the Phoenix Suns , led by All-Stars Tom Chambers and Kevin Johnson . Phoenix defeated the Jazz 3–2 in the first round. Again, the Jazz were left with questions as to how they could do so well in the regular season but fail to advance in the playoffs.  , For the 1990–91 season, the Jazz made another move to improve the team, with a three-way trade being made. Shooting Guard Jeff Malone was brought to Utah from the Washington Bullets , while Eric Leckner and Bobby Hansen were sent from Utah to the Sacramento Kings , and Pervis Ellison ended up going from Sacramento to Washington.  , The Jazz began the season 22–15, before going 27–8 in January and February, with new addition Jeff Malone averaging 18.6 points that season, giving them three strong scoring options (Karl Malone, Jeff Malone, and John Stockton – 64.8 of the team's 104 points per game). The Jazz finished 54–28, 2nd in the division to San Antonio by a game, similar to their division finish the prior year. In the playoffs, they met the Phoenix Suns for the second year in a row. Game 1 was a blowout Utah win, in Phoenix, 129–90, which set the tone for the series, as Utah eliminated the Suns 3–1, earning a second round match-up with the Portland Trail Blazers, the defending Western Conference Champions.  The Jazz played well, keeping close in most of the games, but lost the series 4–1 to a deeper and more experienced Blazers. , The 1991–92 season proved to be the most successful in history, to that time, for the Jazz. They moved to the Delta Center , a state-of-the art arena that seated 19,911 fans. The Delta Center was a huge improvement over the Salt Palace, which seated just over 12,000 and lacked luxury suites and retail space. Early in the year, a trade brought Tyrone Corbin , a tough, defensive forward, from Minnesota in exchange for fan-favorite Thurl Bailey . , The Jazz went 55–27, and won the Midwest Division Title for the first time since 1989, and looked to advance farther in the postseason. In the playoffs, the Jazz defeated the Los Angeles Clippers 3–2 in the first round, then beat the Seattle SuperSonics in the second round, 4–1, to advance to the Western Conference Finals for the first time, where they faced the Portland Trail Blazers . Portland defeated the Jazz 4–2 in the series and again denied them a trip to the NBA Finals. , The 1992–93 season was a disappointment compared with the years before, with a 47–35 mark and 3rd place in the division. The center position, manned by Mark Eaton for most of the past decade, became suspect as he struggled with injuries and age. The bright spot was the hosting of the NBA All-Star Game and the surrounding events of All-Star Weekend. The Jazz lost to the Seattle SuperSonics in the first round, 3–2.  During the postseason, the team addressed the center position by acquiring Felton Spencer from Minnesota, in return for backup center Mike Brown. , During the 1993–94 season, the Jazz traded Jeff Malone to the Philadelphia 76ers for shooting guard Jeff Hornacek . Hornacek meshed well with Stockton, and the Jazz improved to 53–29. In the playoffs, they faced San Antonio in the first round, shutting down NBA scoring leader David Robinson in the series. Robinson had averaged 29.8 points on 50 percent shooting during the regular season, numbers that dropped to 20.0 and 41 percent in the series against Utah.  The Jazz then fought off a determined Denver Nuggets team 4–3 in the Conference semi-finals (almost blowing a 3 games to 0 series lead in the process), to advance to the Western Conference Finals, where they lost to the eventual NBA champion Houston Rockets 4–1. , In the 1994–95 season, the Jazz had significant depth and talent and were expected to make a serious run for the Championship. However, they lost starter Felton Spencer 34 games into the season with a ruptured Achilles tendon . Despite the injury to Spencer, the Jazz finished 60–22. However, the Jazz lost to the Houston Rockets in the first round of the playoffs , 3–2. , Greg Ostertag was added to the team for the 1995–96 season. The Jazz went 55–27, and reached the Conference Finals for the third time in history, nearly overcame a 3–1 series deficit, but eventually lost to the Seattle SuperSonics 4–3. , In the next two seasons, the Jazz were finally able to capitalize on regular season success. In 1996–97 , the Jazz had their best record in franchise history (64–18), and won the Midwest Division and finished with the best record in the Western Conference. The team was made up of the mainstays, Stockton , Malone , and Hornacek , as well as Bryon Russell , Antoine Carr , Howard Eisley , and Shandon Anderson . Malone won his first NBA MVP for the 1996–97 regular season, averaging 27.4 points, 9.9 rebounds, and 4.5 assists per game.  , The Jazz reached the NBA Finals for the first time after beating the Los Angeles Clippers 3–0, Los Angeles Lakers 4–1, and Houston Rockets 4–2. The Jazz then met Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls in the Finals, losing to the Bulls 4–2, with the last two games decided in the final seconds (scores of 90–88 and 90–86).  , During the off-season, the Jazz made no significant changes to the roster. As the 1997–98 season neared, they were expected to be contenders for the Championship again. However, Stockton suffered a serious knee injury before the season, and missed the first 18 games, in which the Jazz went 11–7. Once he returned, the team went 51–13, to finish at 62–20, and won the Midwest Division and homecourt advantage for the playoffs .   , In the playoffs, they beat the Houston Rockets 3-2, and the San Antonio Spurs 4–1, to advance to the Western Conference Finals for the third straight year. Utah, with a veteran core of Stockton, Malone and Hornacek (averaging 34.3 years of age), faced a Los Angeles Lakers squad led by superstar Shaquille O'Neal , guards Eddie Jones , Nick Van Exel , and a young Kobe Bryant . The Jazz set the tone for the series with a win in Game 1, 112–77. Game 2 was closer, a 99–95 Jazz victory, and Games 3 and 4 in Los Angeles were decided by an average of 7.5 points. The Jazz swept the Lakers, and earned a second consecutive trip to the NBA Finals.  , In the 1998 NBA Finals (again against the Chicago Bulls), the Jazz took Game 1 at home, 88–85 in overtime. However, the Bulls overcame a slow start to win Game 2, 93–88, easily took Game 3, 96–54 and won Game 4, 86–82 to lead the series 3–1. The Jazz fought back and won Game 5 on the road, 83–81, to trail 3–2 in the series, with Game 6 (and a Game 7 if needed) in Salt Lake City. The Jazz held a lead in most of Game 6, but the Bulls rallied, and in the last seconds of the game, Michael Jordan stole the ball from Malone on the final Jazz possession and then made a jump shot near the top of the key to win the game, 87–86, and the series for Chicago, 4–2.  , In the 1999 season , shortened to 50 games due to a lockout , the Jazz finished 37–13, tied with the Spurs for the best record in the league. They defeated the Sacramento Kings in five games in the first round of the playoffs . However, they lost in the second round of the playoffs to the Portland Trail Blazers . Despite yet another disappointment, Malone was awarded his second MVP.  , During the 1999–2000 season, the Jazz finished 55–27 and won the Midwest Division but again struggled in the postseason , and lost to the Portland Trail Blazers in the second round. In the off-season, Hornacek retired and Howard Eisley was traded in a four-team deal that brought in Donyell Marshall . They selected promising high school basketball star DeShawn Stevenson in the first round of the 2000 NBA draft . , In the 2000–01 season, they went 53–29, but they faltered in the playoffs, surrendering a 2–0 series lead in the first round of the playoffs to the Dallas Mavericks , to lose the series 3–2, their earliest exit from the playoffs since the 1994–95 season. , In the 2001–02 season, Andrei Kirilenko made his rookie debut, averaging 10.7 points, 4.9 rebounds, and 1.91 blocks per game. The team started slowly, 16–15 over the first two months, and finished 12–13 to go 44–38 overall. They lost to the Sacramento Kings 3–1 in the first round of the playoffs . , Prior to the 2002–03 season, Marshall and Russell moved on to other teams. Matt Harpring was brought over from the Philadelphia 76ers . He took over the starting forward spot next to Malone and averaged 17.6 points and 6.6 rebounds, the best numbers of his career. The Jazz approached 50 wins going into the playoffs , but went 47–35. They faced the Sacramento Kings again, and lost in a seven-game first round series, 4–1. , After the season, the end of an era came as Stockton retired, and Malone left as a free agent to join the Los Angeles Lakers . , With their two franchise lead players Malone and Stockton gone, the team lacked foundation as it went into the 2003–04 season. They were expected to finish near the bottom of the NBA by several NBA preview magazines, including Sports Illustrated .  The Jazz finished with a 42–40 record. The team featured several unheralded players who emerged as key contributors, including Kirilenko, Raja Bell , and Carlos Arroyo . In particular, Kirilenko demonstrated versatility on both offense and defense and earned a spot in the All-Star Game . The Jazz missed the playoffs by one game to the Denver Nuggets , ending a streak of 20 consecutive seasons in the playoffs. Jerry Sloan finished second in the voting for the NBA Coach of the Year Award , losing to Hubie Brown of the Memphis Grizzlies. , During the off-season, the team made moves to bolster the roster; they acquired Carlos Boozer and Mehmet Okur as free agents and re-signed Carlos Arroyo and Gordan Giricek to extensions. , The 2004–05 season was marked by injuries, first to Arroyo and Raul Lopez , and later to Boozer and Kirilenko, which were a large part of the team's fall to the bottom of the division. When healthy, Boozer averaged 17.8 points and 9.0 rebounds in 51 games. The Jazz ended the 2004–05 season 26–56, their worst since the 1981–82 season. , In the summer of 2005, the Jazz continued to shape the roster by trading three draft picks to acquire the No. 3 pick overall, which they used to select Deron Williams . Other transactions included Raja Bell leaving the team for the Phoenix Suns , the Jazz re-obtaining center Greg Ostertag from the Kings, and oft-injured Raul Lopez being traded to the Memphis Grizzlies . , The 2005–06 season was injury-plagued before it started; Boozer missed the first 49 games and Gordan Giricek and Kirilenko both missed significant time due to injuries. Okur and Kirilenko, however, showed consistently good play, while Williams, despite a mid-season slump, did not disappoint. However, team owner Larry Miller expressed displeasure with the team's effort during the season. The Jazz stayed in the playoff race until the third-to-last game, when they lost to the Dallas Mavericks . The Jazz ended the season 41–41, three games out of the playoffs . Ostertag retired at the end of the season, having spent 10 of his 11 NBA seasons with the Jazz. , In the 2006 NBA draft , the Jazz selected Ronnie Brewer in the first round and in the second round selected Dee Brown and Paul Millsap . Several young players were traded to the Golden State Warriors for Derek Fisher , which give them a veteran point guard. The Jazz were heralded by several major sports websites for drafting well and making good offseason moves.  , During the 2006–07 season, the Jazz improved considerably compared to the prior years, finishing with a 51–31 record. Boozer was selected as an All-Star for the first time (though he missed the game due to a minor injury) and center Mehmet Okur was selected to the All-Star game as well. Deron Williams had a breakout second season, finishing third in the league in assists per game with 9.3 (behind Steve Nash and Chris Paul ). , The team also developed a deep bench; in the 10 games that Boozer and Okur (the two leading scorers) missed, the team went 8–2. Millsap was a surprise rookie, becoming a competent backup to Boozer. Despite the elevated play of the Jazz, Kirilenko had a significant drop in his statistics and seemed to struggle adapting to a reduced role, which eventually led to a well-publicized breakdown early in the first round of the playoffs.  , The Jazz faced the Houston Rockets in the first round, a match-up of #4 and #5 seeds (Utah was seeded higher due to winning the Northwest Division, but Houston had a 52–30 record opposed to Utah's 51–31, giving them home court in the series). It was a physical, close-fought match-up, with each of the first six games being won by the home team. The Jazz were able to break this trend in the seventh game, and beat the Rockets 103–99 in Houston. The Jazz went on to face the eighth-seeded Golden State Warriors , who were coming off a historic upset of the #1-seeded Dallas Mavericks . However, the Jazz easily handled the Warriors, and won the series 4–1. They then faced the San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference Finals, but lost to the more experienced Spurs, 4 games to 1 in the series to the eventual NBA Champions. , During the offseason, the Jazz gained a hometown D-League affiliate in the Utah Flash (based in Orem ), which they shared with the Boston Celtics . They selected Morris Almond in the first round, although ultimately they made few lineup changes. The most significant move was in letting Derek Fisher go. Fisher had become a fan favorite due to his strong play, and also a sympathetic one due to his daughter's well-publicized battle with a rare form of eye cancer. Fisher moved to Los Angeles during the off-season to be closer to better care for his daughter, and later signed with the Los Angeles Lakers . Controversy arose after Kirilenko led his Russian national team to a win in EuroBasket 2007 (the European championship), a tournament in which he was named MVP. After that, Kirilenko posted on a blog that he wished to be traded from the Jazz and would be willing to walk away from his contract.  He later reaffirmed this in interviews. However, no trade was made and he remained with the team. , During the 2007–08 season , after a trade that sent Gordan Giricek to the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for Kyle Korver , the Jazz had a record-tying 19-game home winning streak and improved on the road after a rough December. Despite the off-season controversy and trade talk, Kirilenko elevated his play, improving all stats from the previous season, and seemed content with his new role as a defender and a facilitator opposed to a scorer. Boozer again won an All-Star selection, while Williams continued to elevate his play. The Jazz finished the regular season fifth-best in the west with a 54–28 record. For the first time since the 1997–98 season, the Jazz sold out every home game, and they possessed a 37–4 home record; that was, however, offset by a subpar road record. , The Jazz again faced the Houston Rockets in the first round of the playoffs, this time as a № 4 seed (although the Rockets possessed home-court advantage due to a better record). The Jazz took a 2–0 series lead in Houston, but lost the first game in Salt Lake City. After splitting the next two games, the Jazz beat the Rockets 113–91 in game 6, placing them into a second-round match-up with the № 1 seed Los Angeles Lakers , their first postseason meeting since the 1998 Western Conference Finals. Utah lost games 1 and 2 in Los Angeles. However the Jazz held up their great home win record and defeated Los Angeles in Games 3 and 4. The Jazz lost game 5 in L.A. and were eliminated in Game 6. The Jazz made no major moves during the off-season. , The 2008–09 season was difficult for the Jazz as they struggled with injuries that disrupted team chemistry, and although they were again nearly unstoppable at home, they possessed a poor road record. Utah's top three players all missed significant time due to sickness or injury; Williams missed 13 of the first 15 games, Boozer missed more than half of the season, and Okur missed sporadic time due to both injury and his father's sickness that led him to travel to his native Turkey early in the season. On February 20, 2009, Jazz owner Larry H. Miller died of complications from diabetes . His son, Greg Miller, became the new CEO of the team. The Jazz finished with a 48–34 record, slipping to No. 8 in the competitive Western Conference playoff race, after which they were eliminated by the Los Angeles Lakers for the second year in a row, 4 games to 1. , The season ended up being the last for long-time radio and former TV announcer Hot Rod Hundley , who announced his retirement after being with the Jazz for their entire history (35 years). Despite the disappointment, Williams proved to be one of the elite point guards in the league, averaging 19.4 points and 10.8 assists per game, second in the league, despite playing the entire season with a lingering ankle injury. , During the 2009 NBA draft , the Jazz selected Eric Maynor No. 20 overall to back up Williams. Veteran Matt Harpring retired, citing consistent injuries sustained from his physical playing style. Rumors circulated that Boozer wanted a trade, fueled by rumors that the Jazz were shopping him after he chose to "opt in" to the last year of his contract; however, the team stated publicly that they did not seek to trade him. Boozer remained with the team heading into the 2009–10 season . The Jazz also added rookie Wesley Matthews to the lineup after an impressive training camp. , As the 2009–10 season began they started off 19–17. Several trades were made by the team, one that sent Maynor and the contract of the retired Harpring to the Oklahoma City Thunder . Another sent starter Ronnie Brewer to the Memphis Grizzlies at mid-season, a trade which was openly criticized by Williams.  The Brewer trade cleared the way for Matthews to take over his starter spot. Also, Williams was selected to play in the All-Star Game for the first time, and after a controversial off-season, Boozer played better than the year prior, averaging 19.5 points and 11.2 rebounds per game, and missed only four games to injury. He suggested that he would be happy to stay with Utah long-term.  After returning from an early-season injury, Kyle Korver set the NBA record for three-point field goal percentage in a season.  , In a tight Western Conference, the Jazz finished 53–29 and lost the division in a tiebreaker with the Denver Nuggets , ending with the No. 5 seed, matched up with the Nuggets in the first round of the playoffs. Kirilenko, who had missed 13 of the last 15 games of the season due to an injury, re-aggravated the injury the day before the first game of the playoffs and missed the first round, while Okur tore his Achilles tendon in the first game and missed the rest of the playoffs. Despite the injuries, the Jazz played well enough to defeat Denver 4–2 in the series. The Jazz were then eliminated by the Los Angeles Lakers for the third year in a row, being swept 4–0 (the first four-game sweep in Jazz history). , In the 2010 NBA draft , the Utah Jazz selected Gordon Hayward with the No. 9 overall pick, and Jeremy Evans with the No. 55 overall pick. , Boozer agreed to a five-year, $80 million contract with the Chicago Bulls in free agency on July 7, 2010. The Jazz turned the transaction into a sign-and-trade one day later, receiving a trade exception worth around $13 million in return from Chicago.  Kyle Korver also agreed to sign with the Bulls, two days later. Terms were not announced, but multiple reports had his deal as three years, $13 million.  Wesley Matthews signed a five-year, $33 million offer sheet with the Portland Trail Blazers on July 10, 2010. , Less than a week after the Boozer loss, the Jazz traded Kosta Koufos and two future first-round picks to Minnesota for Al Jefferson , using the trade exception from the Boozer deal to receive Jefferson's contract without exceeding the salary cap.  , Raja Bell was added also, to provide backcourt help after the losses of Korver and Matthews. He was signed to a three-year, $10 million contract. , On June 15, 2010, the Jazz unveiled a new color scheme and logo which represented a return to the old 'music note' logo. The team unveiled new uniforms on August 16.  , The Jazz tendered restricted free-agent center Kyrylo Fesenko a $1 million qualifying offer in June 2010. The offer entitled Utah to match any offer that Fesenko accepted from another team, whether signed or not. Fesenko signed the offer on September 27, 2010, the day before training camp began.  , On the eve of training camp, the Jazz added two more players, Francisco Elson and Earl Watson for the 2010–11 season . , The 2010–11 season began on a positive note, as the team went undefeated (8–0) in the preseason, and in mid-January, they were 27–13 and seemed well on their way to another winning season, had that pace continued. However, over the next 14 games, Utah went 4–10. On February 10, 2011, with the team record at 31–23 after a loss to the Chicago Bulls , head coach Jerry Sloan resigned, along with assistant Phil Johnson. Another of Sloan's assistants, Tyrone Corbin , was named the new head coach, while Scott Layden, the other assistant, remained as well. A week later, the Jazz hired former Jazz player Jeff Hornacek as an assistant coach. , On February 23, 2011, the Jazz traded star player Deron Williams to the New Jersey Nets for two 1st round draft picks (New Jersey's 2011 and Golden State's conditional 2012) and players, Derrick Favors and Devin Harris . It was rumored that Williams got into a shouting match with head coach Sloan during a game against the Chicago Bulls, which preceded Sloan's resignation and eventually, the Jazz's decision to trade Williams. , While Williams was under contract through 2011–12 with a player option worth $17.7 million for 2012–13, Jazz chief executive officer Greg Miller did not believe they would be able to re-sign him. "And while I never saw any indication that he wouldn’t re-sign with us, I never saw any indication he would,” said Miller.   The remainder of the season saw the Jazz continue to struggle, finishing with a 39–43 record, 11th in the Western Conference, therefore missing the playoffs for the first time since 2006. , During the 2011 draft , the Jazz had two top-14 picks (one acquired in the trade that sent Williams to the New Jersey Nets), and used them on Enes Kanter and Alec Burks . Following the end of the 2011 NBA lockout that saw the 2011–12 season shortened to 66 games, the Jazz bid farewell to their two longest-tenured players – Mehmet Okur was traded to the Nets for a future second-round pick, and Andrei Kirilenko, who played in his native Russia during the lockout and whose contract had expired after the 2011 season, decided to stay in Russia for the remainder of the 2011–12 season. They also acquired free agent veterans Josh Howard and Jamaal Tinsley . , During the 2012 offseason, the Jazz traded Devin Harris to the Hawks for Marvin Williams.  , In the 2012 draft, the Jazz selected Kevin Murphy with the No. 47 overall pick. The Jazz signed Mo Williams and Randy Foye , both former Clippers, and re-signed Jeremy Evans and Tinsley during the off-season. Long-time Jazz player C. J. Miles decided to sign with Cleveland. Andrei Kirilenko did not re-sign with the Jazz in the off-season. The Jazz also named Dennis Lindsey as GM and Kevin O'Connor as Vice President of Basketball Operations. , Longtime assistant coach Scott Layden left Utah to be a part of the San Antonio Spurs front office. , Before the 2013–14 season began, Utah did not retain either Paul Millsap or Al Jefferson. Millsap accepted a two-year offer to join the Atlanta Hawks ,   while Jefferson signed a deal to become a member of the Charlotte Bobcats franchise.  Jeff Hornacek was hired during the offseason as head coach of the Phoenix Suns.  The Jazz have been accused of tanking as they lost all but one of their first 13 games. The front office, a former member of the San Antonio Spurs organization Dennis Lindsey is said to be the architect of a "tanking" or "rebuilding" season. On March 14, 2014 the Jazz were officially eliminated from playoff contention with a 96-87 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers . , On May 20, 2014, the Jazz earned the 5th pick in the 2014 NBA Draft at the NBA Draft Lottery, with which they picked 18 year old Australian Point Guard Dante Exum . They also had the 23rd pick from a trade with the Golden State Warriors and their own pick in the second round (the 35th pick overall). With the 23rd pick they selected Rodney Hood from Duke University . The 35th pick was used to select Jarnell Stokes , who was subsequently traded to the Memphis Grizzlies for a future second round pick. , On June 6, 2014, Atlanta Hawks assistant coach Quin Snyder was named the eighth head coach in team history. Snyder signed a three-year contract with a team option for a fourth. He replaces Tyrone Corbin .  , The Jazz have not had a natural or fierce rival throughout their history, where each team has been competitive with the other over a long period of time. There have been several teams they have run into many times in the playoffs , however: , Houston (7) – 1985 , 1994 , 1995 , 1997 , 1998 , 2007 , 2008 (Jazz 5–2 Houston) , Los Angeles Lakers (6) – 1988 , 1997 , 1998 , 2008 , 2009 , 2010 (Lakers 4–2 Jazz) , Portland (6) – 1988 , 1991 , 1992 , 1996 , 1999 , 2000 (Portland 4–2 Jazz) , San Antonio (5) – 1994 , 1996 , 1998 , 2007 , 2012 (Jazz 3–2 San Antonio) , Houston won two NBA Championships (1994, 1995) while defeating Utah along the way. Utah advanced to the NBA Finals both times that they defeated the Lakers, while Los Angeles has advanced to the Finals each year they defeated Utah in a series, winning NBA Championships in 1988, 2009, and 2010. Portland advanced to the NBA Finals in 1992 after defeating Utah as well. San Antonio won an NBA Championship in 2007 after defeating Utah in a series, while Utah advanced to the NBA Finals in 1998 after defeating San Antonio in a series. , The Jazz also have a regional rivalry with the Denver Nuggets , also located in the Rocky Mountains, and part of the same division as the Jazz since 1979. , During the 2012-2013 season, the Jazz and the Lakers were fighting off for the number 8 seed in the western conference, but eventually did not make it to the playoff while the Lakers took over the Houston Rockets number 7 seed while the Rockets move down to the 8 seed. The Lakers, eventually lost 4-0 against the eventual Western Conference Champions, the San Antonio Spurs . , The Jazz are the only team in NBA History to have never lost 60 or more games in a season. , Since the team's move from New Orleans to Salt Lake City in 1979, the Utah Jazz have worn several uniforms throughout their franchise history. From 1979 to 1996, the Jazz' home uniforms consisted of the logo (the word "Jazz" with the J represented as a musical note combined with a basketball) on the center chest, with purple numbers. The only modification to this uniform was the word "Utah" being added to the center chest logo in 1986. The road uniforms were purple with the 'J-note' logo and numbers in white. From 1979-84, the Jazz' road uniforms were dark green, with the aforementioned Jazz logo on the center chest and gold numbers. For the 1984–85 season, the road uniforms were changed back to purple, this time with gold numbers and white trim. These uniforms were worn until the 1995–96 season . , For the 1996–97 season , the Jazz drastically updated their logos and uniforms, with a new color scheme of purple (slightly lighter from the previous shade), copper and turquoise. Their new uniform set featured a silhouette of the Wasatch Range on the center chest, with a stylish new Jazz script, and purple & turquoise details. On the road purple jersey, the white mountain range gradually fades to purple just above the numbers, which are white, with copper interior trim and teal outlining. On the home white jersey, the numbers are purple, with white interior trim and teal outlining. The Jazz wore these jerseys until the 2003–04 season . , The Jazz also introduced an alternate black jersey in the 1998–99 season , with the Jazz script on the center chest, but without the Wasatch Range silhouette. On this jersey, both the Jazz script and numbers are white, with purple interior trim and copper outlining, and copper side panels. These jerseys were worn until the 2003–04 season. , In the 2004–05 season , the Jazz once again updated their color scheme, logos and uniforms. The new color scheme, which the team used until the end of the 2009–10 season , consisted of navy blue, powder blue, silver & purple, though the latter color was only used on the primary logo and alternate logo. The team logo remained the same, for the exception of the new color variation. The new home uniform consisted of an updated "Jazz" script on the center chest in navy blue, with navy numbers, both of which had silver interior trim and powder blue outlining. The new road uniform was navy blue, with a "Utah" script in powder blue on the center chest and powder blue numbers, both of which had silver outlining and white interior trim. , In the 2006–07 season , the Jazz introduced a new alternate powder blue uniform. This uniform, which the team used until the end of the 2009–10 season, featured a Jazz script identical to the team logo and navy blue numbers below the script, also with silver and white trim. The nameplate on the back of the jersey was navy blue. , On June 15, 2010, the Jazz unveiled a new logo and color scheme on the team's official website.  For the 2010–11 season , the Jazz reverted to the team's original music note logo (without the word Utah), with a new color scheme of navy blue, gold, dark green & gray.  The new uniform set, which was unveiled on August 16, 2010, features a design nearly identical to the team's aforementioned 1984-96 uniform designs, with the following differences: navy blue replacing purple on the road uniform, dark green numerals on the home white jerseys, a white Jazz logo script on the road jerseys and side panels on both the home and away jerseys. The new uniforms were a combination of both the old and new styles, with navy blue retained from the most recent color scheme, but the now-famous 'J-note' logo and gold and green were revived.  , On December 9, 2011, the Jazz unveiled an alternate jersey that is similar to their road jersey, but swaps the navy and green colors so that the primary color is green, with a navy stripe on the side.   , The following players have rights owned by the Utah Jazz. , Players: , Coaches: , Broadcasters: , Bold denotes still active with team.

The Clippers are a member of the league's Pacific Division of the Western Conference . The Clippers play their home games at the Staples Center , an arena shared with the Los Angeles Lakers of the NBA , the Los Angeles Sparks of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), and the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League (NHL). , The franchise was founded in 1970 as the Buffalo Braves , one of three expansion teams to join the NBA that year. The Braves moved from Buffalo, New York to San Diego , California in 1978 and became known as the San Diego Clippers . In 1984, the Clippers moved to Los Angeles. Through much of its history, the franchise failed to see significant regular season or playoff success. The Clippers were frequently seen as an example of a perennial loser in American professional sports, drawing unfavorable comparisons to the historically successful Lakers, with whom they have shared a market since 1984 and an arena since 1999. , The Clippers' fortunes turned in the early 2010s with the acquisition of core players Blake Griffin and Chris Paul , and in 2013 the franchise won its first division title, as the team made the playoffs for the ninth time in franchise history and the third time in the past eight seasons. They also added to their budding rivalry with the Lakers, as they finished with a better record than the Lakers for the fifth time and won the season series for the second time since moving to Los Angeles in 1984, this time in a sweep. They repeated as division champions in 2014 . , , , The franchise began in Western New York as the Buffalo Braves , one of three NBA expansion franchises that began play in the 1970–71 season, along with the Portland Trail Blazers and Cleveland Cavaliers .  They played their home games at the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium , along with another Buffalo team that would begin play that year, the National Hockey League 's Buffalo Sabres .  After three bad seasons, the Braves' fortunes started to change under coach Jack Ramsay and star forward\center Bob McAdoo .  The Braves qualified for the playoffs three times in a row, losing thrice to the eventual Eastern Conference champions (the Boston Celtics in 1974 and 1976, and the Washington Bullets in 1975). Afterwards owner Paul Snyder sold the team, McAdoo was traded to the New York Knicks , and more poor showings led to low ticket sales.  Eventually in 1978 new owner John Y. Brown, Jr. dealt with Celtics owner Irv Levin so they would trade franchise ownerships. Southern California resident Levin then decided to move the Braves to San Diego , something the league would have never allowed him to do with the Celtics.  , In 1978, San Diego welcomed the relocation of the Buffalo Braves franchise because the city had lost their Rockets to Houston seven years earlier. San Diego team officials did not think Braves was a representative nickname for the club. A contest decided on Clippers because the city was known for the great sailing ships that passed through San Diego Bay.  , In the team's first season in San Diego , it posted a record of 43–39 under new head coach Gene Shue , leaving them two wins shy of the final playoff spot. It would be the Clippers' last winning season for 13 years. It was also in that first season in Southern California that long-time announcer Ralph Lawler began his association with the club. World B. Free , who was acquired in the offseason from the Philadelphia 76ers , finished second overall in NBA scoring average, with 28.9 per game, while George Gervin of the San Antonio Spurs had a 29.6 average. , The 1979–80 season saw the Clippers begin to struggle despite adding center Bill Walton , a San Diego native who was two years removed from an NBA Championship with the Trail Blazers. Walton missed 68 games due to foot injuries (which he also suffered in his final years in Portland). San Diego finished 35–47 as key players missed games due to injuries. Free again finishing second in league scoring, with 30.2 PPG. Paul Silas replaced Shue the following season, and the Clippers finished 36–46, again missing the postseason. Walton missed the entire season again due to foot injuries. Free was traded to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for guard Phil Smith . , The 1981–82 season brought changes to the franchise as Irv Levin sold the team to Los Angeles-area real estate developer and attorney Donald Sterling for US$12.5 million. The Clippers' poor play in the final years in San Diego resulted in averaging only 4,500 fans a game. Sterling lobbied the NBA to relocate the team to his native Los Angeles. , In 1984, the Clippers moved north to Los Angeles , playing at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena . However, the move was not approved by the NBA, which fined Sterling $25 million. He sued the league for $100 million, but dropped the suit when the league agreed to decrease the fine to $6 million.  The Clippers finished their first season in Los Angeles 31–51 under head coach Jim Lynam . , The Clippers' early days in Los Angeles were marred with many seasons of hapless performances. Despite fielding a squad of talented veterans, the organization suffered systematic injuries to many of its star players. The phenomenon was dubbed the "Clipper Triangle" by some sports writers.  Derek Smith suffered a knee injury during the 1985–86 season , followed by Norm Nixon (knee) and Marques Johnson (spinal cord) the following season .  One of the team's low points was its 12–70 finish in 1987 season that was the second-worst single-season record in NBA history at that time (and is now the third-worst winning percentage in NBA history behind the 1973 Philadelphia 76ers and the 2012 Charlotte Bobcats ). That same season also saw Hall of Famer Elgin Baylor join the team as the General Manager and Vice President of basketball operations. Nixon was plagued with another ailment, this time suffering an ailing Achilles tendon in 1987–88 , while number one draft pick rookie Danny Manning injured his anterior cruciate during the 1988–89 campaign .  , Things began to appear promising at the start of the 1989–90 season shortly after the Clippers traded the rights of the recently drafted Danny Ferry and Reggie Williams for the high scoring shooting guard Ron Harper . Los Angeles thrived with a 19–19 record nearly halfway into the season, prompting many to seriously consider the team as a possible playoff contender.  That move, along with the 1987 NBA Draft of Ken Norman , the 1988 draftings of Danny Manning and Charles Smith (Smith was acquired from Philadelphia in exchange for the draft rights to Hersey Hawkins ), and the 1990 NBA Draft of Loy Vaught , formed a nucleus that made the franchise a playoff contender. , Midway through the 1991–92 season , the Clippers made yet another coaching change. Larry Brown , recently fired by the San Antonio Spurs , was hired as the team's head coach in late January 1992. He replaced Mike Schuler , who had led the team to a 22–25 record before his firing. Brown finished the season with a 23–12 mark, for a 45–37 overall—the franchise's first winning season in 13 years. For the first time since moving to Los Angeles, they finished with a better record than the crosstown Los Angeles Lakers . The Clippers advanced to the playoffs for the first time in 16 years (since the franchise's Buffalo heyday), but were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Utah Jazz , 3–2. Due to the late April 1992 Los Angeles riots , the Anaheim Convention Center was the site of Game 4 of the series, which the Clippers won. The team made the playoffs again in the 1992–93 season with a 41–41 record, but lost again in five games in the first round, this time to the Rockets. , Brown left to become the Indiana Pacers ' head coach after the season and Bob Weiss was brought in to replace him. That 1993–94 season proved to be one of the worst in Los Angeles NBA history, with the Clippers and Lakers going a combined 60–104. In February 1994, the Clippers traded Manning to the Atlanta Hawks for Dominique Wilkins . Wilkins played 25 games for the club, averaging 29.1 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 2.2 assists in 37.9 minutes per game. After one year on the job, Weiss was fired, and veteran head coach Bill Fitch was brought in to guide a roster of young and inexperienced players. , From 1994 to 1999 , the Clippers played several games annually (usually five to eight regular season games a season, plus an annual preseason game) at the Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim , sharing the venue with the NHL's Ducks and the Splash indoor soccer team. Clipper games regularly drew a much-higher average attendance per game at the Pond than when the team played its home games at their regular venue, the Los Angeles Sports Arena; the Anaheim games proved so popular that many Clippers players and much of the fanbase, as well as the NBA, wanted to the team to stay in what was considered at the time a state-of-the-art arena. For instance, between 1994 and 1997, the Clippers drew an average of nearly 16,000 fans per game at the Pond, while in Los Angeles, they drew in the neighborhood of 9,200 per home game.  Anaheim officials and the Clippers had have on-going talks about moving to Anaheim full-time even years before the Pond was eventually built,  as Donald Sterling was pursing options to play elsewhere in the Los Angeles metropolitan region if there was not a replacement for the Sports Arena being built. , The Clippers, however, nearly moved to Anaheim permanently in time for the 1996–97 season, but according to a Los Angeles Times article published from June 1996,  owner Donald Sterling turned down a deal that would have paid the team $95 million over twelve years. Odgen Corporation, who at the time managed the Pond, and the city of Anaheim offered the Clippers a multi-tiered deal that would have included upwards of $33 million paid to the team over the first six years of their Pond agreement, plus other monies allocated towards new locker rooms, team offices, and a practice facility. In another related Times article,  Odgen and Sterling were in talks to have the management company take care of the Clippers' day-to-day operations for a $4 million a year fee. Also at the time, the Walt Disney Company , owners of the Ducks and Anaheim Angels baseball team during this time period were pursing at least a partial ownership of the Clippers, with the key element being that its game telecasts would be part of a planned ESPN regional network for Southern California. However, as the planned ESPN West network never came to reality, all three teams had continue to maintain broadcast partnerships with Fox Sports West and Prime Ticket . , In what suppose to be a counter move, the Coliseum Commission, the management entity that managed the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena and Coliseum , had planned to build a new 18,700-seat arena in the parking lot next to the Sports Arena that would have cost up to $94 million, that would have included 1,100 club seats, 84 luxury suites, and an on-site practice facility for the Clippers. However, those plans were scuttled once planning for Staples Center (directly two miles up the street from the Sports Arena) were taking place, and the Clippers deciding to become a tenant at Staples. , In 1999, the Clippers joined the Lakers and Los Angeles Kings in the new Staples Center in Downtown Los Angeles .  In sharing the building with other tenants, such as the highly popular Lakers, the Clippers, with relatively low success, were often overshadowed. Also, because of the terms of its leasing agreement with Staples Center, the Kings and Lakers had scheduling priority over the Clippers, with the Clippers taking whatever dates that were available, including scheduling same-day Clipper-Laker and Clipper-King doubleheaders (as it continues to this day). However, in the years since, the Clippers' scheduling at Staples Center became gradually more favorable (especially given the popularity of the team in recent years) in their lease renewals in 2004 and 2013, with the team receiving increased profits, including more of a share of luxury suite and concession revenue. Since February 2011, the Clippers have sold-out every regular season and post-season home game, behind the popularity of stars Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan, and Chris Paul. , On the court, the Clippers continued to make frequent roster changes throughout this particular period, which only resulted with one playoff appearance under Bill Fitch. Along with Loy Vaught, a collection of young players (including Lamond Murray , Eric Piatkowski , and Lorenzen Wright ), and journeyman veterans (among them Pooh Richardson , Tony Massenburg , Rodney Rogers , Darrick Martin , and Brian Williams ), the Fitch-coached teams during this particular era struggled mightily although they did make the playoffs once during this time. The 1996–97 team made the playoffs with a losing record (36–46) and were swept in the first round by the eventual Western Conference Champion Utah Jazz , three games to none. , Four members of the 1996–97 squad are now deceased. Malik Sealy died in a car accident in 2000, Kevin Duckworth died of heart disease in 2008; Lorenzen Wright went missing and was murdered in 2010, and Dwayne Schintzius died from cancer complications in 2012. Two other players from the Fitch era suffered tragic circumstances of their own; Brian Williams (who played for the Clippers during the 1995–96 season , and later became known as Bison Dele) was believed to be murdered by his brother while the two were vacationing in 2002 while in the South Pacific, and Rogers became paralyzed after a dirt bike crash in 2008 in his native North Carolina. , For all intents and purposes, the Clippers' 1997–98 season ended in December when Vaught, the team's leading scorer for the past three seasons, had season-ending back surgery. Without Vaught, the Clippers were a rudderless team, and finished 17–65, the third-worst record in the league. Fitch was fired after the 1997–98 season (and later had to sue the team to recover the remaining money on his contract), and was replaced by one of his proteges, former Celtics and Bucks coach, Chris Ford . Meanwhile, Vaught's career as a Clipper was effectively finished, as he left as a free agent after that season, and signed with the Detroit Pistons ; at the time of his departure, he became the franchise's all-time rebounds leader with 4,471 (a number that was later surpassed by Elton Brand , with 4,710).  , The Clippers won the first overall pick in the 1998 Draft Lottery and selected center Michael Olowokandi from University of the Pacific . The team went on a 0–17 start and finished with a 9–41 record in the shortened 1998–99 season. They were led by second-year forward Maurice Taylor , who averaged 16.8 points per game. , It was in that first season at Staples Center that they drafted highly touted Lamar Odom . They hired former All-Star (and Los Angeles native) Dennis Johnson as an assistant coach, as well as Hall of Fame former Laker great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to help tutor second-year center Michael Olowokandi . Johnson remained an assistant coach until the middle of the 2002–03 season , when he took over as head coach. Abdul-Jabbar remained only one season. , During the 1999 offseason, Rodney Rogers signed with the Phoenix Suns . The Clippers also sent Lamond Murray to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Derek Anderson and Johnny Newman . However, Newman was traded to the New Jersey Nets for Eric Murdock a month later without ever playing a game for the Clippers. The team finished with the worst record in the league (15–67) in the 1999–00 season, while the Lakers had the best record that year (67–15). , The 2000–01 season brought changes. Derek Strong was sent to the Orlando Magic in exchange for Corey Maggette and the draft rights to Keyon Dooling . The Clippers' two draft picks that year were childhood friends from Illinois: high schooler Darius Miles (3rd overall pick) and Quentin Richardson , (18th overall pick). The team became popular among fans with its high-flying style of basketball and the Clippers did improve a bit with a 31–51 record, leading the NBA in bench-scoring with 37 points per game. , To improve upon the previous season, the Clippers acquired high-scoring and rebounding power forward Elton Brand from the Chicago Bulls in exchange for the draft rights to Tyson Chandler . Brand earned a spot on the 2002 NBA Western Conference All-Star team as an injury replacement for Shaquille O'Neal of the Lakers. The Clippers contended for most of the season, but won only 3 of the last 12 games and finished 39–43, five games out of the playoffs. , The 2002 offseason brought changes, as Miles was traded to the Cavaliers for Andre Miller , who led the NBA in assists in 2001–02 with 11 per game. With a good point guard in Miller, Lamar Odom at small forward, one of the league's best power forwards, Brand, the center Olowokandi, and a good supporting cast off the bench, the Clippers could actually make a run for the playoffs. However, with poor team chemistry and injuries (the Clippers lost 293 man-games to injury), they finished with a disappointing 27–55 record. Head coach Alvin Gentry was replaced by Dennis Johnson midway through the 2002–03 season . , In the 2003–04 season , the Clippers lost many of their core players to free agency (Miller, Odom, Olowokandi, and forward Eric Piatkowski —one of the longest-tenured players in Clippers history  ), while opting to retain Brand and Maggette with long-term contracts. They, along with Richardson, made up one of the NBA best high-scoring trios, with a combined 58 points per game. With new head coach Mike Dunleavy, Sr. , they finished 28–54, due to inexperience and injuries. In the 2004 offseason, the organization and fans anticipated the arrival of Kobe Bryant as a free agent, but were shocked when he decided to accept an 11th-hour offer to remain with the Lakers. , The 2004–05 season saw the Clippers , although also missed the playoffs, finished with a better record than the Lakers for the first time since 1993. Bobby Simmons won the 2004–05 NBA Most Improved Player award after averaging 16 points, 6 rebounds, and 3 assists per game. As a result, Simmons signed a 5-year, $47 million deal with the Milwaukee Bucks . To counter Simmons' defection, the Clippers announced they would sign Cuttino Mobley to a contract similar in years (5) but less money ($42 million) to what Simmons received. Mobley was the first significant free agent signing from outside the organization since Bill Walton in late 1970s. , More deals were made. They traded Marko Jaric (in a sign and trade transaction) and Lionel Chalmers to the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for Sam Cassell and a lottery-protected 1st round pick in the 2006 NBA Draft . In relation to the lottery-protected pick, in order for the Clippers to acquire the pick, the Timberwolves would have to make the playoffs, or Minnesota would retain the pick. , During the summer of 2005, the Clippers announced they would build a state-of-the-art practice facility (the first NBA practice facility within the four corners of the City of Los Angeles) in the Playa Vista development. Several current players on the Clippers' lineup live in the planned community.  , The 2005–06 season was a turning point for the team's image; marked by several wins over top teams. Brand was chosen for the All-Star Game and articles have been written in sports magazines giving recognition to the much improved team. [ citation needed ] Just before the trade deadline, the Clippers traded Chris Wilcox to the Seattle SuperSonics for Vladimir Radmanović . They had lacked consistent outside shooting, which is what they looked for in the trade. , While the Clippers had a few stretches of poor play they were able to maintain a solid record, including posting several winning streaks. They achieved their first winning record in 14 seasons and clinched their first playoff spot since 1997. They also finished with a better record than the Lakers for the second straight year. , By finishing sixth in the Western Conference , with a record of 47–35 (their highest finish since the team left Buffalo ), they benefited from the current NBA playoff format of regular season records taking precedence over winning the division, and secured home court advantage over the Denver Nuggets instead of traveling to Denver for four games as a No. 6 seed would usually be expected to do. , On April 22, 2006, the Clippers won their first NBA playoff game in 13 years. Two days later, they won their second playoff game, going 2–0 against an opponent for the first time in franchise history. They lost Game 3, but won Game 4. On Monday, May 1, 2006, they won Game 5 in Los Angeles and their first playoff series since they moved from Buffalo. , The team faced the Phoenix Suns in the Western Conference Semi-finals. After losing a close Game 1, they won Game 2, 122–97. The series shifted to Staples Center for Game 3, but the Suns won, 94–91. In Game 4, Elton Brand posted 30 points, nine rebounds, and eight assists as the Clippers evened the series. In Game 5, Suns guard/forward Raja Bell made a key 3-pointer with 1.1 seconds left in the first overtime to send the game into a second overtime. However, Phoenix won in double-overtime, 125–118. , They bounced back with a series-saving 118–106 Game 6 win. Second-year defensive specialist Quinton Ross had a timely offensive game, scoring a then career-high 18 points. Brand had 30 points (his scoring average in this particular series), 12 rebounds, and five blocks. Corey Maggette came off the bench to score 25 points, with 7–8 shooting from the field, and 9–9 from the free throw line. Kaman and Cassell each scored 15 points. The Clippers lost the seventh game 127–107. General Manager (and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame member) Elgin Baylor won the NBA Executive of the Year award for leading the Clippers to the playoffs. , The 2006 off-season started as the team drafted Paul Davis in the second round of the 2006 NBA Draft , as the 34th overall pick. The pick was acquired by the Clippers by way of a 2004 trade for Melvin Ely . The team also drafted Guillermo Diaz as the 52nd overall pick. While Davis signed with the team, Diaz decided to play overseas. However, the team still holds his draft rights. , Meanwhile in free agency they signed Tim Thomas away from divisional Phoenix, in a four-year, $24 million deal. That was to counter the defection of Vladimir Radmanović to the Lakers in a similar deal, except Radmanovic signed for an extra year, but both players would make the same amount of money annually, which would be $6 million. , Also Sam Cassell (widely credited as the biggest reason for the Clippers' recent success) signed a two-year, $13 million deal. Cassell stated that once he retired he would like to join the Clippers' coaching staff under Mike Dunleavy, Sr. Also the team signed veteran Aaron Williams to an undisclosed deal. , In September, the Clippers announced a radio broadcast deal with KSPN-AM , the local ESPN Radio -operated outlet. The team did not perform to expectations, compared to the previous season. A lot of this had been attributed to lack of team chemistry and injuries to several key players, including Cassell, Thomas, Livingston, and Kaman. Players such as Luke Jackson , Alvin Williams , and Doug Christie were signed to 10-day contracts to help solidify the team's bench. , Adding to the disappointment of the 2006–07 season, Shaun Livingston suffered a dislocated left knee in which he tore every ligament in his knee. This was one of the most devastating injuries that season that left him a player that would never be the same.  The extent of the injury was so severe, local news outlets such as KCBS-TV / KCAL-TV and KNBC-TV elected not to air the clip of the injury. According to the team's lead physician, Dr. Tony Daly, Livingston's prognosis for him to return to basketball activity was eight months (which was around the first week of the upcoming season ) to a full calendar year.  The Clippers, expected by many to make the playoffs after their surprise appearance the season before, finished the season 40–42, 2 games behind the 8th-seed. The Lakers finished with a better record for the first time since the 2003–04 NBA season . The Clippers received the fourteenth draft pick from the NBA lottery. They selected Al Thornton and Jared Jordan . , The 2007–08 season started off on a negative note, with Brand on the disabled list because of a ruptured left Achilles tendon, and Livingston still out. Brand missed most of the season, and they struggled to stay competitive. Chris Kaman took advantage of a depleted roster by averaging 15.7 points and 12.7 rebounds per game, but was limited to playing 56 games due to various injuries. The Clippers ended the season 23–59. , They saw the departure of several players for the 2008–09 season , including Brand and Maggette, and acquired ten players. Brand's departure stunned everyone, because he had stated that he loved playing for L.A. and wanted to stay, but negotiations for a new contract fell apart and he accepted a huge deal from the Philadelphia 76ers . Baron Davis , a Los Angeles native and formerly of the Golden State Warriors , signed a five-year contract with the Clippers, worth an estimated $65 million.  , After a disappointing 2007–08 season, the Clippers obtained the 7th pick in the 2008 NBA Draft , and selected Eric Gordon .  They also selected DeAndre Jordan (35th overall pick). Mike Taylor (55th overall pick), was acquired from the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for a future second-round pick. , Also in July, they acquired Marcus Camby from the Denver Nuggets in return for a $10 million trade exception and the choice to exchange second round picks with the Clippers in 2010.  On July 23, the Clippers also acquired guard Jason Hart from the Utah Jazz in exchange for guard Brevin Knight .  On July 28, they signed Ricky Davis to a one-year deal, with a player option for a second year.  They continued an active offseason, signing former Clipper Brian Skinner in July, and traded for Steve Novak in August for future second-round pick considerations, in a deal similar to the Camby trade. , In August, the team signed Jason Williams to a one-year deal.  The Clippers re-signed Paul Davis. They signed three Davises (Baron, Ricky, and Paul) in their "rebuilding offseason" in which they obtained key players such as Baron Davis, Marcus Camby, Ricky Davis, and Williams. However, just prior to the start of training camp, in September, Williams announced his retirement. , In October, according to reports from various sources including the Los Angeles Times ,   Orange County Register ,  and the team's own web site (Clippers.com), Elgin Baylor ended his 22-year reign as Vice President and General Manager of basketball operations. It was one of the longest tenures in professional sports history. The Clippers indicated that Baylor had retired from his post,  and as a result, head coach Mike Dunleavy, Sr. assumed the role of General Manager, while director of player personnel Neil Olshey was promoted to assistant general manager. , In many of those reports, including a related article in the October 8 edition of the Times,  it was also indicated that Baylor had either been fired, resigned, or retired, depending on the source. According to similar reports, Baylor had been offered a different position in the organization, with the same salary, but with little to no decision-making power; Baylor refused. In fact, when pressed about his status with the franchise, Baylor had been advised by his attorneys not to say anything, indicating that the team and Baylor are in negotiations to work out a settlement agreement based on his departure. According to the above-mentioned article, Baylor had been working without a formal contract since the early 1990s. , On November 21, 2008, the Clippers and New York Knicks completed a trade, in which Los Angeles sent Tim Thomas and Cuttino Mobley to New York, in exchange for Zach Randolph and Mardy Collins .  With the trade of Mobley, only one member of their 2005–06 playoff team remained on the roster, Chris Kaman. In December, Mobley announced his retirement due to a heart condition known as Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy discovered during his physical; although he never played a game for the Knicks, they completed the trade anyway for salary cap reasons. , On January 6, 2009, the Clippers waived Fred Jones and Paul Davis to open a roster spot for a center from Senegal Cheikh Samb  (the Clippers have since re-signed Jones). The Clippers ended the 2008–09 season  14th in the Western Conference with a record of 19–63.  , In May 2009, the Clippers won the first overall pick in the 2009 NBA Draft and selected Blake Griffin . To clear a spot in the lineup for him, they traded Zach Randolph to Memphis for Quentin Richardson. Richardson was then traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Sebastian Telfair , Craig Smith , and Mark Madsen .  , Griffin immediately impressed in training camp and preseason. On October 23, he broke his kneecap during the Clippers' final exhibition game against the New Orleans Hornets , following a dunk. Initially, the Clippers' stated that he only had a sore left knee, which would make him questionable for the season opener the following night, before they revealed the break. The injury sidelined Griffin for the entire season.  , On February 4, 2010, head coach Mike Dunleavy resigned, and Kim Hughes was named interim coach.  Dunleavy retained his front-office title and duties for just over a month, but on March 10 he was fired as General Manager, being replaced by Neil Olshey . Dunleavy received the news of his dismissal from the internet, as well as friends and reporters calling his cell phone.  The Los Angeles Times reported that Dunleavy had filed for arbitration and that the Clippers had cut off his salary, even though his guaranteed contract did not end until after the 2010–2011 season.  Although the Clippers saw minor improvement, finishing with ten more wins at 29–53, Hughes was fired as head coach at the end of the season. , In July, former Chicago Bulls coach Vinny Del Negro was hired as the next head coach.  In August, the team introduced new uniform designs at a photo shoot, at the team's practice facility. Griffin and DeAndre Jordan modeled the new uniforms, which were re-designed for the first time since the 2000–01 season.  The Clippers' primary and secondary logos, which are modifications of the previous ones, were introduced to the public weeks earlier, on the night of the 2010 NBA draft . , With Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, an improved DeAndre Jordan, a re-energized Baron Davis, and the debut of No. 1 pick Blake Griffin, the Clippers had high hopes for the season. However, they started slowly, losing ten of the first eleven games with Davis and Kaman out with injuries. However, the Clippers showed strength when three of their first four wins came from the top teams in the Western Conference . Griffin got off to a strong start, drawing increased media attention in Clippers games and boosting ratings of local broadcasts of Clippers games.  Griffin was chosen as a Western Conference Reserve in the 2011 NBA All-Star Game , a rare honor for a rookie, the first chosen by the coaches for the game since Tim Duncan in 1997. He also won the NBA Sprite Slam Dunk Contest. As the trade deadline approached, the Clippers sent Baron Davis along with their 2011 first round draft pick to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Mo Williams and Jamario Moon . The first pick they gave turned out to be first overall, Kyrie Irving . , In December 2011, the Clippers signed Caron Butler to a $24 million deal and claimed veteran point guard Chauncey Billups three days later. On December 14, 2011, they traded Eric Gordon , Chris Kaman , Al-Farouq Aminu and Minnesota's 2012 first-round pick acquired in 2005 for New Orleans Hornets ' four-time all-star Chris Paul . Paul had previously almost been traded to the Los Angeles Lakers , but NBA commissioner David Stern had vetoed the trade. Paul and Griffin were selected as starters for the Western Conference team in the 2012 NBA All-Star Game , the first time in franchise history the team had two All-Star starters in the same year. , The team gained the nickname "Lob City" due to a comment made by Griffin during the Clippers Media Day when the announcement of Chris Paul's trade reached the team. Griffin, after being told the news by close friend DeAndre Jordan, declared, "Yeah! It's going to be lob city!"  , In February 2012, the Clippers signed Kenyon Martin . An eleven-year NBA veteran and former NBA All-Star (2004), Martin joined the Clippers after signing with the Xinjiang Guanghui Flying Tigers of the Chinese Basketball Association the previous summer. On February 6, 2012, during a game against the Orlando Magic , Billups tore his Achilles tendon and missed the remainder of the season. In March 2012, Nick Young joined the Clippers as part of a three-team trade with the Washington Wizards and the Denver Nuggets . He became the eighth player to debut in the 2011–2012 season. , After a stretch that saw the Clippers lose 12 of 19 games after Billups's season-ending injury, with rumors of Vinny Del Negro 's career as head coach of the Clippers possibly coming to an abrupt end, Los Angeles went on a tear.  The Clippers won 12 of their next 14 games, including road wins over the defending champion Dallas Mavericks and the Western-Conference-leading Oklahoma City Thunder , clinching their fifth playoff berth since their 1976 conference semi-finals loss to the Boston Celtics (the last time they made the playoffs as the Buffalo Braves) before a dominating home win over the Oklahoma City Thunder on April 16, 2012. It was their third win in four regular-season games against the Thunder. Chris Paul's push for the NBA Most Valuable Player Award was at its peak. The 2011–2012 NBA season was the first time the Clippers were in the playoffs since 2005–2006. , In their first playoff game, the Clippers rallied from a 27-point deficit against the Grizzlies to win 99–98 in one of the biggest rallies in playoff history. They led the series 3–1, then lost two straight, before coming back to win Game 7 in Memphis 82–72 and prevail to the second round. The Clippers relied on their bench during that game, and they came through, scoring all but two of their points in the fourth quarter. In the second round of the playoffs, the team was swept by the San Antonio Spurs .  , On June 4, 2012, GM Neil Olshey reached an agreement to become General Manager of the Portland Trail Blazers .  Olshey was replaced as Clippers GM by Gary Sacks .

On September 14, 2012, the Clippers signed Matt Barnes to a one-year deal. On November 29, 2012, public address (PA) announcer David Courtney died in a hospital in Los Angeles for reasons not yet revealed. He was replaced by former Clippers and current Los Angeles Dodgers PA announcer Eric Smith. , On December 15, 2012, with a 111–85 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks , the Clippers recorded their record ninth consecutive win, breaking their previous franchise record (in Los Angeles) of eight wins set in the 1991–92 season .  On December 21, 2012, with a 97–85 win over the Sacramento Kings , they notched their twelfth consecutive victory, breaking their previous 11-game streak as the Buffalo Braves in the 1974–75 season .  On December 30, 2012, the Clippers recorded their 17th straight win against the Utah Jazz , beating them 107–96. The win also made the Clippers the third team in NBA history to record an undefeated month ending the month of December 16–0. Their streak ended when they lost to the Denver Nuggets on January 2, 2013. They ended the streak with a franchise record of 17 wins. , On January 9, 2013, with a 99–93 victory over the Dallas Mavericks , the Clippers recorded another franchise record with their 13th straight home victory  On January 12, 2013, the Clippers 13 game home win streak came to an end with a 104–101 loss to the Orlando Magic .  , A 126–101 victory over the Phoenix Suns saw the Clippers reach the 50-win mark for the first time in franchise history, breaking their previous mark of 49 from 1975–76 when they were in Buffalo.

The Clippers entered the 2013 NBA Playoffs as the 4th seed to once again face the 5th seeded Memphis Grizzlies . The Clippers would go up 2–0 early in the series after a buzzer beater by Chris Paul in game 2. After being up 2–0 in the series, the Clippers would lose 4 games in a row to be eliminated the first round. , On May 21, 2013, the team declined to renew Vinny Del Negro 's contract as head coach. On June 24, 2013, the NBA approved a trade of Doc Rivers, from the Boston Celtics to the Los Angeles Clippers for an unprotected 2015 NBA first round draft pick.  , A day later, on June 25, 2013, Glenn "Doc" Rivers , a former Clippers player best known for his nine-year tenure as the head coach of the Boston Celtics , was announced as Del Negro's replacement. As compensation for Boston allowing Rivers to leave his contract with the Celtics and join the Clippers, Los Angeles traded two future first-round draft picks, in addition to an anti-trade clause preventing the Clippers and Celtics from engaging in further transactions amongst each other, including the exchanging of players, for the duration of the 2013–14 season.    , On July 3, 2013, the Clippers traded Eric Bledsoe and Caron Butler to the Phoenix Suns for Jared Dudley and J.J Redick (from the Bucks). The Clippers and Suns also sent two second-round draft picks to the Milwaukee Bucks . On July 7, 2013, the team resigned Matt Barnes , Chris Paul and Ryan Hollins . Paul's deal was for 5 years, worth around $105.3 million. The team also signed Darren Collison to fill the back-up point guard role, replacing the departed Eric Bledsoe and free agent Chauncey Billups , who signed with the Detroit Pistons . On August 28, 2013, the Clippers signed free agent power forward Antawn Jamison to a one-year deal worth the veteran minimum, appeared only twenty-two games and eventually traded to Atlanta Hawks on February 20, 2014 in exchange for the draft rights to Cenk Akyol .

Griffin averaged only 10.4 points in the second-round series. , On April 25, 2014, entertainment news website TMZ released a taped conversation in which team owner Donald Sterling – who had a history of accusations of racist behavior against African Americans and Latinos dating back to the 1990s – reprimanded V. Stiviano (born Maria Vanessa Perez and of African American and Mexican heritage, who had reportedly been dating Sterling while he was estranged from wife Rochelle Stein) after posting an Instagram photo featuring her, former Los Angeles Lakers point guard Magic Johnson and another woman. Sterling stated that it bothered him that she had "broadcast that [she is] associating with black people," and that he did not want Stiviano to bring them to the team's games.  The remarks in the tape caused public backlash (including condemnations from many current and former NBA players such as Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , Charles Barkley , Shaquille O’Neal , LeBron James , and Kobe Bryant ); several sponsors also severed ties with the team (among them, Kia Motors (for whom Blake Griffin serves as its television spokesperson), State Farm Insurance and Virgin America ).  Threats of boycotts against the Clippers were also considered, with the team itself briefly contemplating one of the April 27 playoff game against the Golden State Warriors (the fourth game in the team's first round playoff series) – players opted to protest Sterling's remarks by wearing their shirts inside-out, obscuring team logos.   , On April 29, 2014, the NBA issued Sterling a lifetime ban from the organization after a league investigation into the recording confirmed that he was the one conversing with Stiviano. The league also issued a $2.5 million fine against Sterling (the highest allowable by the NBA) and barred him from attending games or practices involving any NBA team; being present in any Clippers office or facility; and from participating in any team business, player personnel decisions or league activity. NBA commissioner Adam Silver stated in a press conference regarding the decision that he will try to force Sterling to sell the Clippers, which would require the consent of three-quarters of the league's 29 other team owners.  Silver later announced that that NBA would appoint a CEO to run the team.  Before the ban was handed down, Sterling said in a phone conversation with Fox News contributor Jim Gray that he had no plans to sell the team.  , On May 9, 2014, the NBA named former Citigroup chairman and former Time Warner chairman and CEO Richard Parsons the interim CEO of the team.  , On May 27, 2014, Steve Ballmer , former CEO of Microsoft , agreed to purchase the team for $2 billion.   To buy the team, Ballmer reportedly beat out other candidates including Oprah Winfrey, Floyd Mayweather, Magic Johnson, and a group of crowdfunders.   Although Ballmer lives in the Seattle area and had been part of an ownership group that had unsuccessfully attempted to move the Sacramento Kings to that city, he has indicated that he has no intention of moving the Clippers.  On August 12, 2014, Ballmer officially took control of the team following an order by a California court that confirmed the sale from Shelly Sterling to Ballmer. As part of the deal Shelly Sterling gets the titles of "Owner Emeritus" and "Clippers' Number 1 Fan," as well as ten tickets in sections 101 or 111 for all Clippers games, two courtside tickets for all games in Los Angeles, six parking spots in Lot C for each game, 12 VIP passes that include access to the Lexus Club, Arena Club, or Chairman's Lounge and Media room or equivalent, for each Staples games, three championship rings following any Clippers title, and will run a yet to be named charitable foundation.     , The Clippers first regular season under Ballmer's ownership ended with a 56-26 record and the #3 Western Conference seed going into the 2015 NBA Playoffs . They met with the defending the NBA Champions San Antonio Spurs. The series went a full 7 games, and with 1 second left, Chris Paul hit the clutch game-winning shot to advance Los Angeles into the Western Conference Semi-Finals.  In the next series, they matched up against the #2 seeded Houston Rockets. The Clippers would build a 3-1 series lead that included 25 and 33-point wins in games 3 and 4, respectively. However, Houston would rally and win the final 3 games to deny Los Angeles from making their first ever appearance in the Conference Finals. , On June 15, 2015, the Clippers acquired Lance Stephenson from the Charlotte Hornets in exchange for Matt Barnes and Spencer Hawes .  , The Clippers hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.  This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. , Only three players have been inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame-based significantly upon achievements while with the franchise: , One other Hall of Famer joined the franchise late in his career: , Three other Hall of Famers served the franchise in management positions: , McAdoo and Randy Smith (G, 1972–79, 1983–84) are also members of the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame. Walton, a native of the San Diego area, is also a member of the San Diego Hall of Champions . , NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player , NBA Rookie of the Year , NBA Most Improved Player , NBA Teammate of the Year , NBA Executive of the Year , All-NBA First Team , All-NBA Second Team , All-NBA Third Team , NBA Defensive First Team , NBA Rookie First Team , NBA Rookie Second Team , NBA All-Star selections , 1979–80 , 1984–85  The Sacramento Kings are a professional basketball team based in Sacramento , California . They are members of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Kings are the only team in the major professional North American sports leagues located in Sacramento; they play their home games at Sleep Train Arena . , The Kings are the oldest franchise in the NBA, and one of the oldest continuously operating professional basketball franchises in the nation. They originated in Rochester, New York as the Rochester Seagrams in 1923. In 1945, the team was renamed the Rochester Royals and joined the National Basketball League . They jumped to the Basketball Association of America, forerunner of the NBA, in 1948. As the Royals, the team was often successful on the court, winning the NBA championship in 1951. However, they found it increasingly difficult to turn a profit in the comparatively small market of Rochester, and relocated to Cincinnati , Ohio in 1957, becoming the Cincinnati Royals . In 1972, the team relocated to Kansas City, Missouri , initially splitting their games between Kansas City and Omaha , Nebraska , and taking up the name Kansas City Kings . The team again failed to find success in that market, and moved to Sacramento in 1985, although in the past decade they still are struggling with their last post season appearance being in 2006. , , , The Kings can trace their origins to a company team based in Rochester, New York in 1923 and originally known as the Rochester Seagrams.  In 1945, it merged with another semi-pro team, the Rochester Pros, owned by Lester Harrison and his brother Jack, to form the Rochester Royals. The merged team then turned fully professional in the National Basketball League (NBL), winning the championship in its first year in the league with future NFL Hall of Famer Otto Graham on the roster. The Royals defected to the NBL's rival, the Basketball Association of America , in 1948. In 1949, as a result of that year's absorption of the NBL by the BAA, the Royals became members of the newly formed NBA along with the Fort Wayne Pistons , Minneapolis Lakers, and Indianapolis (Kautskys) Jets . A year later, the BAA absorbed the remaining NBL teams to become the National Basketball Association . , The move to the BAA took away Rochester's profitable exhibition schedule, and placed it in the same Western Division that Minneapolis was in. Of the two best teams in pro basketball, only one of them could play in the league finals from 1949–1954. Minneapolis, with George Mikan , was almost always a little better at playoff time than the Royals. With their smallish arena and now-limited schedule, the Royals became less profitable even as Harrison maintained a remarkably high standard for the team, which finished no lower than second in its division in both the NBL and BAA/NBA from 1945–1954. Harrison knew that the NBA was outgrowing Rochester, and spent most of the 1950s looking for a buyer for his team. , The Royals won the NBA title in 1951 by defeating the New York Knicks 4 games to 3. It is the only NBA championship in the franchise's history. However, the title did not translate into profit for the Royals. The roster turned over in 1955, except for Wanzer; the team moved to the larger Rochester War Memorial . Now a losing team filled with rookies, the Royals still did not turn a profit. Meanwhile, the NBA was putting pressure on Harrison to sell or relocate his team to a larger city. With this in mind, the 1956–57 season was the Royals' last in Rochester. , The Royals' stay in Rochester featured the services of nine future members of the Basketball Hall of Fame, one member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and a Hollywood Walk of Famer: Al Cervi , Bob Davies , Alex Hannum , Les Harrison , Red Holzman , Arnie Risen , Maurice Stokes , Jack Twyman , Bobby Wanzer , Otto Graham , and Chuck Connors . , In April 1957 , the Harrison brothers moved the Royals to Cincinnati . This move followed a well-received regular season game played at Cincinnati Gardens on February 1, 1957. The change of venue had been said to have been suggested by Jack Twyman and Dave Piontek, who were two of several roster players on the new Royals from that region. Cincinnati, which had a strong college basketball fan base and no NFL franchise to compete with, was deemed the best choice for the Harrisons. The Royals name continued to fit in Cincinnati, often known as the "Queen City". , During the team's first NBA draft in Cincinnati, the team acquired Clyde Lovellette and guard George King . They teamed with the 1–2 punch of Maurice Stokes and Twyman to produce a budding contender in the team's very first season in the Queen City. Injury to Marshall and the loss of star guard Si Green to military service dropped the team into a tie for second place in the NBA Western Division during the 1957–58 season's second half. , In the season's finale, All-Pro star Maurice Stokes struck his head when he fell after pursuing a rebound. He shook off the effects of the fall, even as he had briefly been unconscious. After Game One in the playoffs three days later, Stokes' head injury was greatly aggravated by airplane cabin pressure during the flight back to Cincinnati for Game Two. He suffered a seizure and was permanently hospitalized, a tragedy that greatly shook the team. Stokes, a tremendous talent who could play center, forward and guard, was 2nd in the NBA in rebounds and 3rd in assists, a double-feat only Wilt Chamberlain has matched for a full season. Without Stokes, the team nearly folded. , Fellow All-Star Twyman rose to All-Pro level the next two seasons for Cincinnati, even as the team posted two 19-win seasons. The 1958–59 Cincinnati team featured five rookies, with Lovellette, King and other key players having left the team in the wake of Stokes' tragic injury. The Harrisons, under pressure to sell to a local group, sold to a local ownership headed by Thomas Woods. The fact that Stokes was simply dumped by the team and the new ownership infuriated many. , Jack Twyman came to aid of his teammate and even legally adopted Stokes. Raising funds for Stokes' medical treatment, Twyman helped him until his death in April 1970. The 1973 feature film Maurie , which co-starred actors Bernie Casey and Bo Svenson , dramatized their story. , Shooting often for the beleaguered team, Twyman was the second NBA player to average 30 points per game for an NBA season. Twyman and Stokes were later named Hall of Famers. , In 1960, the team was able to land local superstar Oscar Robertson . Robertson led a team that included Twyman, Wayne Embry , Bob Boozer , Bucky Bockhorn , Tom Hawkins and Adrian Smith over the next three seasons. The Royals reversed their fortunes with Robertson and rose to title contender. An ownership dispute in early 1963 scuttled the team's playoff chances when new owner Louis Jacobs booked a circus for Cincinnati Gardens for the week of the playoff series versus the champion Boston Celtics . The Royals home games were at Xavier University 's home Schmidt Field House . , In late 1963, another local superstar, Jerry Lucas , joined the team. The Royals rose to second-best record in the NBA. From 1963 to 1966, the Royals contended strongly against Boston and the Philadelphia 76ers , but won no titles. The team's star players throughout the 1960s were Oscar Robertson and Jerry Lucas. Robertson met with individual success, averaging a triple-double in 1961–62 and winning the Most Valuable Player award in 1964 . Robertson was a league-leading scorer and passer each season. Lucas was Rookie Of the Year in 1964, led the league in shooting, and later averaged 20 rebounds per game over three seasons. Both were All-NBA First Team selections multiple times. , The team failed to keep promising players and played in the tough NBA East division, dominated by the Boston Celtics, even as a Baltimore team played in the West Division for three years, denying the team likely visits to the NBA Finals. , In 1966, the team was sold to Max and Jeremy Jacobs . That same season , the Royals began playing some of their home games in neutral sites such as Cleveland (until the Cavaliers began play in 1970), Dayton and Columbus, Ohio which was the norm for the rest of the Royals tenure in the Queen City. , New coach Bob Cousy traded Lucas in 1969. Robertson was traded to Milwaukee in 1970, where he immediately won an NBA title. The declining franchise left Cincinnati shortly thereafter, moving to Kansas City in 1972 . , The Royals, on moving to Kansas City, renamed themselves the Kings to avoid confusion with the Royals baseball team. The team initially divided its home games between Kansas City and Omaha until 1975 , when it abandoned the Omaha market. During that time the team was officially called the "Kansas City-Omaha Kings". The move from Omaha marked the opening of the 16,785-seat Kemper Arena in Kansas City. During the first days the Kings played at the 7,316-seat Municipal Auditorium in Kansas City and the 9,300 seat Omaha Civic Auditorium in Omaha. , The team netted a new superstar in Nate Archibald , who led the league in scoring and assists. The Kings later played several home games in St. Louis during the early 1980s to large crowds. , While still in Cincinnati, the Kings introduced a most unusual uniform design, which placed the player's surname below his number. The design remained intact through the first several seasons of the team's run in Sacramento, even when the shade of blue on the road uniforms was changed from royal blue to powder blue, and the script '"Kansas City"' which adorned the road jerseys was scrubbed after the move in favor of a repeat of the "Kings" script on the home shirts. The Kings' back jersey template was later adopted by the WNBA and the NBA Development League , as well the NBA during the All-Star Game since 2006. , The Kings had some decent players throughout. Tom Van Arsdale , the shooting forward, "Jumpin" Johnny Green, and Matt Guokas helped Archibald in the first year in Kansas City. Toby Kimball was a fan favorite. Jimmy Walker teamed with Archibald as the Kings made the playoffs the second year. Sam Lacey, an effective passing center, became one of the most dependable players in the league. Archibald became the first player to lead the league in scoring and assists in the first season in Kansas City. However, the management traded Archibald, and wasted high draft picks. Bob Cousy gave way to Phil Johnson , who was fired midyear in 1977 and replaced by Larry Staverman , a player on the team on two separate occasions when it was in Cincinnati and who later became the Cleveland Indians groundskeeper. , The Kings finally achieved some success in their new home when they hired Cotton Fitzsimmons as coach. Fitzsimmons won the Midwest Division in 1978–79 with rookie point guard Phil Ford , who was NBA Rookie of the Year in 1979. Kansas City was led by shooting guard Otis Birdsong , strong on both offense and defense, all-around shooting forward Scott Wedman, and passing center Sam Lacey, who had a trademark 25-foot (7.6 m) bank shot. They drew an average of 10,789 fans to Kemper Arena that season, the only time during their tenure in KC that average attendance was in five figures (the attendance at the peak was only two-thirds of Kemper's capacity). The Kings made the playoffs in 1979–80 and again in 1980–81 , despite finishing the regular season at 40–42. The Kings made a run in the NBA Playoffs , reaching the Western Conference Finals. Ernie Grunfeld played the point in this run, as KC used a slow half-court game to win the first two rounds. Power forward Reggie King had a remarkable series, dominating the opposition. After upsetting the Phoenix Suns by winning Game 7 at Phoenix in the Conference Semifinals, they bowed to the Houston Rockets in five games in the Conference Finals. , However, a series of bad luck incidents prevented the team from building on its success. Cleveland Cavaliers owner Ted Stepien lured Wedman and Birdsong away with big contract offers. In 1979, the roof literally fell in at Kemper Arena because of a severe storm, forcing the team to play most of the 1979–80 season at the much smaller Municipal Auditorium. The ownership group sold the team to Sacramento interests for $11 million. The general manager was fired in a scandal in which he was found to be reusing marked postage stamps. When the Kings rehired Joe Axelson as general manager, they brought back the man who had previously traded Oscar Robertson, Norm Van Lier, Nate Archibald and Jerry Lucas, and used the third pick in the ABA dispersal draft on Ron Boone . Axelson stayed on after the Kings left Kansas City where, in their last game ever, fans wore Joe Axelson masks. Axelson later said he hoped his plane would never touch down in Kansas City. , Axelson became the first general manager in the history of sports to fail with the same franchise in four different cities: Cincinnati, Kansas City, Omaha and Sacramento. He was not fired for good until he rehired coach Phil Johnson, whom he had fired in mid-season in Kansas City ten years before. The Kings also had the misfortune of entering this period competing with the Kansas City Comets for the winter sports dollar, when the Comets were led by marketers—the Leiweke brothers. Their final season, 1984–85 , resulted in a 31–51 record as fans stayed away from Kemper Arena in droves, with average attendance of 6,410. New York Knicks forward Bernard King suffered a devastating knee injury on March 23. Long-time ABA and NBA star, Don Buse , played his final professional season for the Kings. , The Kings moved to their current home of Sacramento, California in the 1985–86 NBA season , with their first Sacramento season ending in the first round of the Western Conference 1986 NBA Playoffs . However, they saw little success in subsequent years, and the team did not make the playoffs again until the 1996 NBA Playoffs in the 1995–96 NBA season . Some of their failure was attributable to misfortunes such as the career-altering car crash suffered by promising point guard Bobby Hurley in 1993, and the suicide of Ricky Berry during the 1989 offseason; some was attributed to poor management such as the long tenure of head coach Garry St. Jean and the selection of "Never Nervous" Pervis Ellison with the first overall pick in the 1989 NBA Draft . Current Kings television broadcaster Jerry Reynolds and NBA legend Bill Russell were among the early coaching staff. , The early 1990s were difficult for the Kings. Sacramento was known for having strong fan support, and while they won over 60% of their home games, the team struggled on the road, going 1–40 on the road in a single season. But prayers were answered when they acquired Mitch Richmond , who previously played for the Golden State Warriors . The former NBA Rookie of the Year was selected as an All-Star six times while making the All-NBA Second Team three times. Garry St. Jean was chosen as new coach in 1992 and coached the team all the way through 1997, where he was replaced by Eddie Jordan. , Besides Richmond, Sacramento had other stars like Spud Webb , Walt Williams , Olden Polynice and Brian Grant during the 90's, but they only lasted with the team for a few years. Webb was traded to the Atlanta Hawks for Tyrone Corbin in 1995, Williams would be sent to the Miami Heat for Billy Owens (who was drafted by the Kings in 1991, and traded to Golden State for Richmond) midway through the 1995-96 season, Grant went to free agency during the 1997 offseason and sign with the Portland Trail Blazers , and Polynice signed with the Seattle SuperSonics in 1999. , One accomplishment the team achieved under St. Jean during their tenures was a playoff appearance in 1996. The series was lost 3-1 to the Seattle SuperSonics who, led by Gary Payton and Shawn Kemp , finished as that year's conference champions. They did not make a playoff appearance again while Richmond was still on the Kings. He was soon traded along with Otis Thorpe to the Washington Wizards for Chris Webber in May 1998. Although Richmond was lost, this trade proved to be one of the keys to finally achieving playoff success after so many seasons of mediocrity. , The Kings began to emerge from mediocrity with the draft selection of Jason Williams in the 1998 NBA Draft , the signing of Vlade Divac , and the trade for Chris Webber prior to the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season. These acquisitions coincided with the arrival of Peja Stojakovic from Serbia , who had been drafted in 1996 . Each of these moves was attributed to general manager Geoff Petrie , who has won the NBA Executive of the Year Award twice. , Led by new head coach Rick Adelman , and aided by former Princeton head coach Pete Carril , the Kings' Princeton offense impressed others for its quick style and strong ball movement. Some criticized the Kings for their poor team defense, Williams's "flash over substance" style with its many turnovers, and Webber's failure to step up in important match-ups. Still, they quickly garnered many fans outside of California, many of whom were drawn to the spectacular pairing of Williams and Webber. In 1998-99, they went 27-23, their first winning season in nearly twenty years and their first since moving to Sacramento. The new arrivals Webber, Williams, and Divac all played key roles in this resurgence; Divac ranked near the top of the team in most statistics, Webber led the league in rebounds and was named to the All-NBA Second Team , and Williams was named to the All-Rookie First Team . In the playoffs, they were matched up against the defending Western Conference Champions, the Utah Jazz . After winning Game 1 by 20 points, the Jazz surrendered two in a row to the Kings. They would turn the series around, however, and win the last two to keep the Kings from advancing in the playoffs. , In 1999-2000, the Kings went relatively quiet; their only notable transaction was the acquisition of former Orlando Magic shooting guard Nick Anderson . They finished 8th in the Western Conference with a respectable 44-38 record and were matched up with the Los Angeles Lakers in the first round of the playoffs. Once again, however, the Kings failed to advance, losing the series 2-3 against the Lakers. , Following the season, the Kings traded starting small forward Corliss Williamson to the Toronto Raptors for shooting guard Doug Christie , a move made to improve the subpar defense. They also drafted Turkish power forward Hedo Turkoglu , further improving their bench rotation. Stojakovic moved into the starting small forward role, where he and Webber proved to complement each other extremely well, and as the Kings continued to improve, their popularity steadily rose, culminating in a February 2001 Sports Illustrated cover story entitled "The Greatest Show on Court" with Williams, Christie, Stojakovic, Webber, and Divac gracing the cover. That year, they went 55-27, their best in 40 years. In the playoffs, they won their first series in 20 years, defeating the Phoenix Suns three games to one, before being swept in the second round by the Lakers , who eventually won the NBA Championship. , In July 2001, the Kings made a major move. Jason Williams was traded, along with Nick Anderson, to the Vancouver Grizzlies for Mike Bibby and Brent Price . Despite Williams's often spectacular play, the Kings had grown tired of his recklessness and turnovers; Bibby would provide much more stability and control at the point guard position. This move was complemented by the re-signing of Webber to a maximum-salary contract, securing their superstar long term. With Bibby taking over for Williams, they had their best season to date in 2001–02 . Though not as exciting or flashy as they had been in previous years with Williams, the team became much more effective and disciplined with Bibby at the helm. They finished with a league-best record of 61–21, winning 36 of 41 at home. After easily winning their first two playoff matchups against the Jazz and the Dallas Mavericks , respectively, the Kings went on to play the arch rival and two-time defending champion Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference Finals, regarded as one of the greatest playoff matchups in history. In a controversial series,  the Kings lost in seven games, one game away from what would have been the first NBA Finals and professional sports championship in Sacramento history. This was a crushing blow to the Kings; after losing to their arch rivals in a highly controversial series, the team would begin to decline and age in the years that followed. Many commentators and journalists would question the decisions made by the referees during Game 6, specifically that the Lakers were awarded a staggering 27 free throws in the fourth quarter, many of which came from what were in retrospect proved to be no-calls.  Following Game 6 even print newspapers began to question the legitimacy of the game. Most notably, the New York Post ran a front cover with a headline entitled "foul play" and suggestions that the game was rigged. NBA analyst David Aldridge (then working for ESPN ) spoke on the game: , The 2002 Western Conference finals left many fans wondering whether the Kings could have gone on to win a title, and debate would continue for many years after the events of the series.  Later, due to allegations raised by former NBA referee Tim Donaghy , the NBA set up a review of the league's officiating. Lawrence Pedowitz, who led the review, concluded that while Game 6 featured poor officiating, there was no concrete evidence that the game had been fixed.  , The Kings went 59-23 and won the division during the following season , seeking to avenge their playoff loss to the Lakers. After easily dispatching the Jazz in the first round and winning Game 1 Dallas Mavericks in the second round, the Kings appeared to be on the brink of another Western Conference Finals berth. However, Chris Webber sustained a devastating knee injury in Game 2, and the Kings lost in a gut-wrenching seven-game series. Webber's knee required major surgery. He returned mid-season in 2003–04 , but without his quickness and athleticism, which had been the focal point of his style of play, the Kings ended the season on a sour note with a playoff defeat to the Kevin Garnett -led Minnesota Timberwolves in seven games. , , The 2004–05 season marked change for the Kings, who lost three starters from the famed 2002 team. In the off-season of 2004, Divac signed with the Lakers, which prompted the Kings to sign Brad Miller to start at center. Early in the season, Christie was traded to the Orlando Magic for Cuttino Mobley, and in February, Webber was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers for three forwards ( Corliss Williamson , Kenny Thomas , and Brian Skinner ). Thomas and Skinner failed in their attempt to replicate Webber's impact, and as a result the team's record suffered. The Kings lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Seattle SuperSonics . The 2005 off-season continued with changes, when they traded fan-favorite Bobby Jackson for Bonzi Wells and acquired free agent Shareef Abdur-Rahim . , The 2005–06 season started poorly since the Kings had a hard time establishing team chemistry. Newcomers Wells and Abdur-Rahim made major contributions early, but both were injured and missed a significant number of games. As the Kings' season continued, general manager Petrie decided to make a major move. Stojakovic was traded for Ron Artest , a talented yet volatile forward known for his temper. Despite doubts that he would be able to replace the huge production of Stojakovic, Artest and the Kings went 20–9 after the 2006 NBA All-Star break, the second best post-All-Star break record that season. Despite a winning record of 44–38, it was clear that they were not the same team of years past. The Kings were seeded 8th in the Western Conference playoffs and were matched up in the first round against the San Antonio Spurs. Though the Kings were surprisingly competitive, the Spurs eliminated them 4-2. This was the end of their era of competitiveness and to date, their last winning season. The 2006 off-season began with the disturbing news that head coach Rick Adelman's contract would not be renewed. The Kings named Eric Musselman as his replacement. , , In 2006–2007, the disappointing play of the Kings was coupled with the distraction of legal troubles. Coach Eric Musselman pleaded no contest to DUI charges early in the season, while Artest got into trouble for neglect of his dogs, and was later accused of domestic assault . The Kings relieved Artest of basketball duties, pending investigation, then later reinstated him. They finished the season 33–49 (their worst in 9 years) which landed them in fifth place in the Pacific Division. They posted a losing record (20–21) at home for the first time since 1993–94. Their season included a seven-game losing-streak that lasted from January 4 to January 19. The Kings missed the 2007 NBA Playoffs , the first time in eight seasons. Musselman was fired in April. The Kings' future appeared to rest on the shoulders of Kevin Martin , who was a lead candidate for 2007 NBA Most-Improved Player of the Year. , The 2007 off season was a time of change. Head coach Musselman was replaced by former Kings player, Reggie Theus . The Kings selected Spencer Hawes with the 10th overall pick in the 2007 NBA Draft . In addition, they acquired Mikki Moore from the New Jersey Nets. Martin signed a contract worth $55 million, extending his period with the team for five more years. The Kings lost key players over the off-season, with backup Ronnie Price leaving for the Utah Jazz, and Corliss Williamson retiring. , They claimed fourth-year Beno Udrih off waivers from Minnesota. Udrih quickly assumed the starting position for an injured Bibby. It was announced in February that the Kings had traded Bibby to the Atlanta Hawks for Tyronn Lue , Anthony Johnson , Shelden Williams , Lorenzen Wright and a 2nd round draft pick. The move was presumably made to clear cap space. Bibby had been last player from the Kings team that reached the Western Conference Finals in 2002. , The Kings improved by 5 games and finished the 2007–08 season 38–44, and missed the playoffs by a bigger margin (12 games) than the previous season (8 games). They went 26–15 at home and 12–29 on the road. After selling out every home game since 1999, the 2007–08 season sold out only three games at ARCO Arena with attendance averaging 13,500 fans per home game, almost 4,000 below capacity. , Following a quiet 2008 off-season, it was confirmed on July 29, 2008 that the Kings would trade Artest and the rights to Patrick Ewing, Jr. and Sean Singletary to the Houston Rockets in exchange for former King Bobby Jackson , Donté Greene , a future first round draft pick, and cash considerations  for Rashad McCants and center Calvin Booth . , Reggie Theus was fired in the middle of the 2008–09 season, giving way to Kenny Natt as the interim head coach. The Kings continued to struggle under Natt, ending up with the NBA's worst record for the 2008–09 season at 17–65. On April 23, 2009, Kings' Vice President Geoff Petrie announced the firing of Natt and his four assistants, Rex Kalamian, Jason Hamm, Randy Brown and Bubba Burrage.  , Despite having the best odds to win the top overall pick in the 2009 NBA Draft , the Kings obtained the 4th overall pick, the lowest they could possibly pick, to the outrage of many fans. Along with new head coach Paul Westphal , they selected Tyreke Evans . With the 23rd pick, they selected Omri Casspi from Israel. , On April 27, 2010, Evans was the first Sacramento era player to receive the NBA Rookie of the Year Award . Evans also became the 4th player in NBA history, joining Oscar Robertson , Michael Jordan , and LeBron James , to average 20 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists per game as a rookie. , On June 24, 2010, the Kings selected DeMarcus Cousins with the 5th pick of the 2010 NBA Draft . They also selected Hassan Whiteside , with the 33rd pick of the 2010 NBA Draft . , Despite the excellent play of Cousins and Evans, both of whom where frontrunners in Rookie of the Year voting   and received All-Rookie First Team honors,   the Kings still ranked near the bottom of the NBA, going 25-57 in Evans' rookie year, and 24-58 in Cousins' rookie year. Much of this was due to the poor fit of the roster around Evans and Cousins, and the uninspired coaching of Westphal. , The 2010–2011 season was marked with uncertainty towards the end of the season. Frustrated by the lack of progress towards an arena and dwindling profits from other businesses, the Maloofs sought an immediate relocation of the franchise to Anaheim. The move seemed certain towards the end of the year, with Grant Napear and Jerry Reynolds emotionally signing off at the final home game vs. the Los Angeles Lakers. But after a vote by the NBA board of Governors, the relocation effort was ended, to the glee of the fans. , In the 2011 NBA draft the Kings traded for the draft rights of Jimmer Fredette in a three team deal with the Charlotte Bobcats and the Milwaukee Bucks , with the Kings receiving John Salmons sending Beno Udrih . This move was heavily panned by fans and media; by moving down in the draft and losing longtime starter Udrih for the unproductive Salmons, most found it difficult to find a bright spot in the deal. Westphal would shortly be fired, with Warriors assistant Keith Smart hired as his replacement. Around this time, the team took the slogan "Here we rise!" for its marketing campaign. Amidst various relocation rumors and locker room tensions, the Kings had yet another unsuccessful season. One of their few bright spots was rookie Isaiah Thomas . Due to criticisms about his height (5'9 in shoes) and playmaking ability, Thomas slipped to the 60th and final pick of the draft. Despite this, and the presence of college superstar Fredette, Thomas earned the starting spot, finishing the season with averages of 11 points and 4 assists per game and earned a selection to the NBA All-Rookie team. In the 2012 NBA draft they selected Thomas Robinson out of Kansas . , Because of an unproductive rookie season by Robinson, he was traded with Francisco Garcia and Tyler Honeycutt to the Houston Rockets in exchange for Patrick Patterson , Toney Douglas and Cole Aldrich .  , On May 16, 2013, the Maloof family reached agreement to sell the Sacramento Kings to a group led by Silicon Valley tech entrepreneur Vivek Ranadivé for a then-record NBA franchise valuation of $535 million. Ranadivé, 55, named Raj Bhathal , 71, founder of Tustin -based Raj Manufacturing ,  one of the largest swimwear companies in the nation, as one of the investors in a consortium to buy a majority stake in the Kings from the franchise's longtime owners, the Maloof family, for a reported $348 million. The group fought off a rival bid that would have moved the team to Seattle after the NBA's Board of Governors rejected investor Chris Hansen 's bid to relocate the team.   The new owners intend to keep the team in Sacramento .  On May 28, the NBA Board of Governors unanimously approved the sale, ending several years of efforts by other cities to take possession and move the Kings out of Sacramento.   On May 31, 2013, the Kings closed escrow, finalizing the sale to the Ranadivé group at a record valuation of $534 million, beginning a new era for the franchise.  Plans were already underway to move forward on an arena, as the Downtown Plaza was reportedly being sold to the Sacramento ownership group. A month later, on July 30, Turner Construction was selected to be the builder of the arena. , Once the sale had closed and ownership was transferred to Ranadivé, the Kings began changes the management and staff. Geoff Petrie  and Keith Smart  were released; Mike Malone  and Pete D'Alessandro  were brought in to replace them. Corliss Williamson , Brendan Malone , Chris Jent , and Dee Brown were brought in as assistant coaches. On July 10, NBA executive Chris Granger was hired as team president. On September 23, 2013, Shaquille O'Neal purchased a minority share of the team, jokingly dubbing the team's new organization the "Shaqramento Kings". , These hires coincided several roster moves. In the 2013 NBA Draft on June 27, the Kings selected Kansas shooting guard Ben McLemore , who was widely projected to go top-five, with the seventh overall pick. They also selected point guard and former McDonalds All-American Ray McCallum, Jr. from the University of Detroit with the 36th pick. One week later, on July 5, the Kings sent former NBA Rookie of the Year Tyreke Evans to the New Orleans Pelicans in a three-team deal involving Robin Lopez , Greivis Vasquez , Jeff Withey , Terrel Harris , and picks. On July 9, the Kings traded a future second-round draft pick to the Bucks in exchange for defensive small forward Luc Richard Mbah a Moute , and on July 15, the Kings signed Carl Landry, who had played a stint with the team in its previous ownership, to a 4-year deal worth $28 million. , The 2013-14 season was widely anticipated by Kings fans. Playing their first game on October 30, against the Nuggets, the Kings won 90-88, despite being without projected starters Landry and Mbah a Moute. They were led by a 30-point, 14 rebound performance from DeMarcus Cousins , and a putback dunk by Jason Thompson with under a minute to play which sealed the victory for the Kings. , After the poor play of starting forwards John Salmons and Patrick Patterson through November, the Kings sought a change. On November 26, newly acquired Luc Richard Mbah a Moute was traded for power forward Derrick Williams . Nearly two weeks later, on December 8, they acquired Rudy Gay in a blockbuster seven-player deal that sent the struggling Patterson and Salmons to Toronto along with Chuck Hayes and offseason acquisition Greivis Vasquez . Quincy Acy and Aaron Gray were also sent to the Kings. The organization sought to add depth to their lineup during the 2014 off-season to complement the Kings' star duo DeMarcus Cousins and Rudy Gay.  Sacramento added Darren Collison , Ryan Hollins and Ramon Sessions through free agency signings, as well as drafting Nik Stauskas prior to the start of the 2014-15 season . After a 11-13 start to the season, head coach Michael Malone was fired by the Sacramento Kings organization. Tyrone Corbin filled in for the Kings for the rest of the season. Corbin underperformed and the Kings lost 21 of their next 28 games. Hall of Fame coach George Karl replaced him in February 2015. , On January 30, 2015, Demarcus Cousins was named to replace the injured Kobe Bryant as a Western Conference All-Star in the 2015 NBA All-Star Game . Cousins' selection marked the first time a Kings player earned All-Star honors since Brad Miller and Peja Stojaković represented Sacramento in 2004.  , The initial Rochester Royals logo featured a blue and white shield with the word "ROCHESTER" on the top, with a white banner with the word "ROYALS" on it. From the beginning the road uniforms were blue with the city name written in front, while home uniforms were white with the team name written in front. Red accents were added later in their Rochester tenure. , Upon moving to Cincinnati in 1957, the team logo became a basketball with a cartoon face. The basketball was depicted as wearing a crown with the city of Cincinnati within it. The word "CINCINNATI" was featured above the logo while the word "ROYALS" was below. The crown also had the team name on it. This logo was white with blue outlines. The uniforms remained blue on the road and white at home, again with red accents and the city/team name designation on the respective uniforms. In the late 1960s the Royals wore a uniform with the team name written vertically on the left side, with the number on the right. In 1971, the team would adopt a red crown with a blue half-basketball below it. The word "CINCINNATI", in blue, was placed above the logo. The word "ROYALS", in white, was placed on the crown. The logo change also reflected on the uniforms, now featuring a script 'Royals' in front with red numbers. However blue names and numbers at home, and white names and numbers on the road were written at the back of the uniform, with the unusual arrangement of the number above the name being used for the first time. , For the 1972–73 season, the renamed and relocated Kansas City-Omaha Kings kept their uniforms and logos, with the exception of the name change. After settling in Kansas City for good in 1975, the Kings changed their road uniforms back to reading the city name in front. Beginning with the 1981–82 season, the road uniforms reverted to the team name in front, while numbers in front took on the same color schemes as the numbers in the back. , Following their move from Kansas City in 1985 the Kings still used the same color scheme of red, white and blue. The logo of a crown atop a bottom half of the basketball was also carried over. However, the shades of blue used on their home and road uniforms were different for five seasons. The home uniforms use royal blue, while the road uniforms use powder blue. The striping patterns were also different between the two uniforms, with the script "Kings" wordmark on the sides of the road shorts, and basic side stripes on the home uniforms. Carrying over from Kansas City was the unusual placing of player names at the bottom of the number at the back of the uniform. , The uniforms changed slightly in 1990, with royal blue now used on the road; the shorts now incorporate the Kings logo, and the name and number switch places to a more standard basketball jersey. The player names were now in a standard monotone serif font which was used by several NBA teams. This version would mark the last time the classic script "Kings" wordmark was used until 2005. , In 1994, the Kings radically changed their look, adopting a new color scheme of purple, silver, black and white. The uniform set consists of one wide side stripe running through the right leg of the shorts, with the primary Kings logo prominently featured. The home uniform is in white, while the road uniform is in black (By later coincidence, the NHL's Los Angeles Kings would use that exact color scheme). From 1994–97 a half-purple, half-black uniform, featuring checkerboard side panels was used as an alternate uniform, which was panned by fans. However, the uniform would be revived for the 2012–13 season during Hardwood Classics Nights. A new purple uniform which shares the same template from the home and road uniforms, was introduced in the 1997–98 season. , Before the start of the 2002–03 NBA season, the Kings changed their uniforms once again. This set included a modernized version of the "Kings" script on the home jersey, and the city name on the purple road jersey. The side stripes now run through the uniform. In the 2005–06 season they introduced a gold alternate uniform, featuring the classic script "Kings" wordmark. However, this alternate lasted only two seasons. , In 2008, the team introduced a new style of uniforms, with the names switching designations with a modernized "Kings" script on the road jersey in black text, and "Sacramento" on the home jersey still in white text. In doing this, the Kings became unique; most professional franchises place the team nickname on the home jerseys and the city name on the road jerseys. The numbers are black on both uniforms. The side panels were revamped, now only featured on the shorts and at the top half of the uniform. Before the 2011–12 season a black alternate uniform was introduced, sharing the same template as the home and road uniforms, but with the classic script "Kings" wordmark and silver numbers. , For the 2014–15 season, the Kings made a few tweaks to their home and away uniforms. While the team kept the 2008-era template, they brought back the 1994–2002 "Kings" script from the primary logo on both uniforms, along with purple (home) and white (away) numbers. The black alternate uniform was kept without any alterations. In addition, the crown logo at the back was replaced by the NBA logo, while a gold tab above it represents the franchise's 1951 NBA championship.  , Since the 1997–98 season , the official Kings mascot is Slamson the Lion .   , Prior to moving to Ohio, the Royals' biggest rival was the Syracuse Nationals . That team went on to become the Philadelphia 76ers . This left upstate New York without a team until the Buffalo Braves were established in 1970. This third attempt did not last, with the Braves moving to San Diego, California in 1978 to become the San Diego Clippers . , In 1970, the Cleveland Cavaliers were established. This brought a new rival for the Royals, as well as a new team in Ohio. This rivalry did not last, and the Royals moved to Kansas City only a few years later. Although the NBA previously had a team in St. Louis, Missouri in the form of the St. Louis Hawks , by 1972 that team moved to Atlanta, Georgia , thus preventing a potential new rivalry for the Kings. This made the Kings the first team in the state in four years. Thirteen years later, the Kings moved to California, leaving Missouri without a team. , The rivalry with the Lakers began when the Kings traded for Chris Webber in 1998. Featuring matchups such as Vlade Divac vs. Shaquille O'Neal , it became one of the most competitive in the NBA, climaxing when the two teams met in the 2002 West Conference Finals .  From that point on, injuries and trades would dull the rivalry,  though it has begun to emerge again with the Kings drafting center DeMarcus Cousins , and the Lakers trading for center Dwight Howard .  Both teams, however, have had a lack of success, with the Kings failing to make the playoffs and the Lakers being swept in the first round as the number 7 seed in the 2013 playoffs and losing many of their star players to injuries ( Kobe Bryant , Steve Nash ) or free agency (Howard to the Houston Rockets ) in the following season.  , The following players have rights owned by the Sacramento Kings. , The 2005 Sacramento Monarchs WNBA Champions banner, as well as the Monarchs 2006 Western Conference Champions banner, also hang from the rafters of Sleep Train Arena. , Bold denotes still active with team.

They are members of the Southwest Division of the Western Conference of the National Basketball Association (NBA). , According to a 2015 Forbes magazine report, they are the tenth most valuable basketball franchise in the United States, valued at approximately $1.150 billion.  , As of the 2013 season, the Mavericks have sold out 477 consecutive games since December 15, 2001, the longest currently running sellout streak in North American major league sports. , Since their inaugural 1980–81 season , the Mavericks have won three division titles ( 1987 , 2007 , 2010 ), two conference championships ( 2006 , 2011 ), and one NBA Championship ( 2011 ). , , , In 1978, Californian businessman Garn Eckardt met Dallas lawyer Doug Adkins, and mentioned he was trying to raise capital to move an NBA team to the city. Asking for a possible partner, Adkins recommended him one of his clients, Home Interiors and Gifts owner Don Carter . Negotiations with Eckardt fell through, but Carter remained interested in the enterprise as a gift to his wife Linda, who played basketball while at Duncanville High School . At the same time, Buffalo Braves president and general manager Norm Sonju grew an interest in bringing the NBA to Dallas as he studied possible new locations for the ailing franchise. While the Braves went to California as the San Diego Clippers , Sonju eventually returned to Texas, and was introduced to Carter by mayor Robert Folsom , one of the owners and team president of the last professional basketball team in the city, the Dallas Chaparrals of the American Basketball Association - which moved to San Antonio in 1973 to become the San Antonio Spurs . Sonju and Carter tried purchasing both the Milwaukee Bucks and the Kansas City Kings , but disagreement on relocation stalled the negotiations, leading them to instead aim for an expansion team . The league was initially reluctant to expand to Dallas, given Texas had both the Spurs and Houston Rockets , and the 1978-79 NBA season was proving unprofitable (18 out of the 22 teams lost money) and unpopular (television ratings fell 26 percent). Still, during the 1979 NBA All-Star Game weekend, NBA commissioner Larry O'Brien announced the league would add two new teams in the 1980-81 season , with teams in Dallas and Minneapolis . Once the Minnesota team backed out, only Dallas remained, and through negotiations with general counselor and future commissioner David Stern , the expansion fee was settled on the $12.5 million. Carter would provide half the amount, with   , At the 1980 NBA All-Star Game , league owners voted to admit the new team, with the team's name coming from the 1957–1962 TV western Maverick ; the name was chosen by the fans with 4600 postcards received, beating Wranglers and Express . James Garner , who played the namesake character, was a member of the ownership group. The University of Texas at Arlington , who also uses the Mavericks nickname , had objections about a shared name, but did not attempt any legal action.  They joined the Midwest Division of the Western Conference , where they would stay until the league went to six divisions for the 2004–05 season . Dick Motta , who had guided the Washington Bullets to the NBA Championship in 1977–78 , was hired as the team's first head coach . He had a well-earned reputation of being a stern disciplinarian, but was also a great teacher of the game. [ citation needed ] , Kiki Vandeweghe of UCLA was drafted by the Mavs with the 11th pick of the 1980 NBA draft , but Vandeweghe refused to play for the expansion Mavericks and staged a holdout that lasted a month into the team's inaugural season. Vandeweghe was traded to the Denver Nuggets , along with a first-round pick, in 1981, in exchange for two future first-round picks that eventually materialized into Rolando Blackman in 1981 and Sam Perkins in 1984 . , In the Mavericks' debut game, taking place in the brand-new Reunion Arena , the Mavericks defeated the Spurs, 103–92. But the Mavs started the season with a 6–40 record on their way to finishing 15–67. However, the Mavericks did make a player acquisition that, while it seemed minor at the time, turned out to play a very important role in the early years of their franchise. Journeyman 6 ft 3 in guard Brad Davis , who played for the Anchorage Northern Knights of the Continental Basketball Association , was tracked down and signed by the Mavs in December. At the time, there was absolutely no reason to expect that Davis would be any better than the expansion-level talent the Mavs had. [ citation needed ] But he started the Mavs' final 26 games, led the team in assists, and his career soared. He spent the next twelve years with the Mavericks, and eventually his number 15 jersey was retired. The Mavericks also marked the first NBA team to have a profitable debut season, with an average of 7,789 spectators.  , The 1981 NBA Draft brought three players who would become vital parts of the team. The Mavs selected 6'6" forward Mark Aguirre with the first pick, 6'6" guard Rolando Blackman 9th, and 6'7" forward Jay Vincent 24th. By the end of his seven-year Mavs career, Aguirre would average 24.6 points per game. Blackman contributed 19.2 points over his 11-year career in Dallas. But it was Jay Vincent who made the biggest difference for the Mavs in their second season, leading the team in scoring with 21.4 points per game and earning NBA All-Rookie Team honors. The Mavericks improved to 28–54, getting out of the Midwest Division cellar as they finished above the Utah Jazz . , In 1982–83 , the Mavericks were serious contenders for the first time. At the All-Star break , they were 25–24 and had won 12 of their last 15 games. They could not sustain that momentum, and finished seven games behind the Denver Nuggets for the sixth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference. But the Mavs' 38–44 record was a 10-game improvement from the previous season. , Mark Aguirre led the 1982–83 Mavericks with 24.4 points per game, finishing sixth in the NBA. Jay Vincent and Rolando Blackman contributed 18.7 and 17.7 points per game, respectively. Brad Davis was 10th in the NBA in assists with 7.2 per game, and shot .845 from the free-throw line, 6th in the league. Derek Harper was drafted by the Mavs with the 11th pick of the 1983 NBA draft . The 6 ft 4 in guard would spend the next decade with the organization, averaging 15 points and 6.1 assists. The Mavericks' in 1983–84 posted a winning record for the first time in franchise history, finishing 43–39 and second in the Midwest Division. The Mavs also earned the first playoff berth in franchise history. Mark Aguirre was named the team's first NBA All-Star, as he finished with an average of 29.5 points per game—second in the league to Utah's Adrian Dantley . , Dallas finished with the fourth seed in the Western Conference playoffs, and in their first playoff trip they defeated the Seattle SuperSonics in five games. The fifth and deciding game of that series was played at Moody Coliseum , as Reunion Arena, then the home court for the Mavericks, was hosting a tennis tournament. The Magic Johnson -led Los Angeles Lakers were next for the Mavs, and the young club fell short, losing four games to one. But a trade the Mavericks made in their inaugural season of 1980 paid off for them in 1984, because they owned Cleveland 's first-round pick, which ended up being the fourth pick overall. The Mavs used it to select forward-center Sam Perkins , a former North Carolina Tar Heel with surprising range from the three-point line who would average 14.4 points and 8.0 rebounds in six seasons with Dallas. , About this time, the Dallas Cowboys , once one of the NFL 's elite teams, began a slow decline that eventually saw them fall to 1–15 in 1989 . The Mavs were hitting their stride at about the same time, and replaced the Cowboys as the Metroplex' team. The 1984–85 team finished a game better than the previous year at 44–38. Mark Aguirre led the team in scoring again with 25.7 ppg, Sam Perkins made the All-Rookie team, and Rolando Blackman represented the Mavericks in the 1985 NBA All-Star Game . The Mavs returned to the playoffs in 1985 , but were not as successful as they had been the previous year. They won Game 1 in double-overtime against the Portland Trail Blazers in their first-round playoff series, but lost the next three games in a row, ending their season. , Dallas had the eighth pick in the 1985 NBA draft —again due to a trade with the Cavaliers—and drafted German-born forward Detlef Schrempf out of Washington . He would show flashes of brilliance in his three-plus seasons with the team, but it was not until he was traded to the Indiana Pacers that he displayed his full potential. The Mavericks also traded center Kurt Nimphius to the Los Angeles Clippers for center James Donaldson , who would play for the Mavericks until halfway through the 1991–92 season . This allowed the Mavericks to have the steady hand at center that had been lacking throughout the franchise's first five years. In 1988, James Donaldson was the only All-Star center in Dallas Maverick history. , Rolando Blackman represented the Mavericks in the 1986 NBA All-Star Game , hosted by Dallas at Reunion Arena. The 1985–86 Mavericks were second in scoring at 115.3 points per game, gaining them their third-straight playoff appearance. They defeated Utah three games to one in the first round. In the conference semi-finals, they ran into the Lakers again, and L.A. defeated Dallas in six games. But four of those games were decided by four points or less, and Dallas won half of those, leaving Mavericks fans room to hope that they could finally top the Lakers in the following season. The Mavs drafted Michigan center Roy Tarpley with the seventh overall pick, who would go on to become a very talented—but troubled—member of the roster. , The 1986–87 Mavericks team had their most successful regular-season to date, going 55–27 and winning their first Midwest Division title. But despite the great expectations surrounding the team, they self-destructed in the playoffs. After hammering the Seattle SuperSonics by 22 points in Game 1, the bottom dropped out for the Mavs, as they lost Games 2 and 3 in close fashion before succumbing in Game 4 in Seattle . Following the unexpected early playoff exit, Motta, who had been with the team since its inception, shockingly resigned as head coach. John MacLeod , who had led the Phoenix Suns to nine playoff berths in 11 seasons including an NBA Finals run in 1976, was hired as his replacement. , The 1987–88 NBA season saw the Mavericks dip just a little bit in the regular season—finishing 53–29 and losing their Midwest Division title to the Denver Nuggets —but it was another successful year for the team. Mark Aguirre and James Donaldson both played in the 1988 NBA All-Star Game , the Mavericks rattled off a franchise-best 11-game winning streak, and Rolando Blackman scored his 10,000th career point. Aguirre led the team in scoring for the sixth consecutive year with 25.1 points per game, and Roy Tarpley won the NBA Sixth Man Award with averages of 13.5 points and 11.8 rebounds. The season saw the Mavs' deepest playoff run to date. They dispatched the Houston Rockets in four games and the Nuggets in six, leaving only the defending NBA Champion Lakers between them and their first-ever trip to the NBA Finals . The Mavericks gave the Lakers everything they could handle, but in the end the more experienced Lakers prevailed, defeating Dallas in seven games on the way to eventually winning their second consecutive NBA Championship. , Despite all the changes, the Mavs remained in contention. However, their season effectively ended when James Donaldson went down with a ruptured patella tendon on March 10, 1989 and missed the rest of the season as a result. The Mavericks were left undermanned, demoralized and disheartened as they finished with a 38–44 record. It was their first losing season since 1982–83—which was also the last time they missed the playoffs. , The Mavericks returned to the playoffs in 1989–90 with a 47–35 record, but it was another season of off-court chaos. On November 15, only six games into the Mavs' season, Tarpley was arrested for driving while intoxicated and resisting arrest. The team started 5–6 and MacLeod was fired, replaced by assistant coach Richie Adubato . The Mavs finished the season with four straight victories to surge into the playoffs, but went down rather meekly to the Portland Trail Blazers in three games. It would be the team's last winning season and last playoff appearance until 2001. , The team endured numerous changes in 1990, losing Sam Perkins to the Lakers via free agency and suffering injuries to practically their entire 1990–91 starting lineup. The players they managed to acquire— Rodney McCray , Fat Lever and Alex English —were all in the twilight of their careers. On November 9 it was announced that Fat Lever would have season-ending surgery on his right knee, and that very night, Tarpley suffered a knee injury of his own which ended his season. The Mavericks' season only got worse from there, and they finished with a record of 28–54, the worst in the NBA, falling behind even the second-year Minnesota Timberwolves and Orlando Magic . In March 1991, Tarpley was charged with suspicion of driving while intoxicated and was suspended again by the NBA. , It got even worse in 1991–92 . Before the season even began, Tarpley violated the league's substance abuse policy for the third time and was banned from the NBA for life. The former Sixth Man Award winner's fall from grace was complete. The few talented players the Mavericks had remaining to them were lost to injury. Brad Davis' back problems forced him to retire in mid-January, and Fat Lever had knee surgery again on January 29, missing the remainder of the season—hardly worth the cost of losing two first-round draft picks. The team finished with a 22–60 record. , In 1992–93 , the rebuilding began in earnest, with the Mavs trading Rolando Blackman —who by that point had surpassed Mark Aguirre as the team's all-time leading scorer—to the New York Knicks for a first-round draft pick. Blackman had made four All-Star Game appearances in his Mavericks career. Herb Williams joined the Knicks as a free agent. Fat Lever underwent more surgery and missed the entire 1992–93 season. Derek Harper was the team's sole bright spot, leading the team with 18.3 points per game. , The Mavericks selected Ohio State guard Jim Jackson with the fourth overall pick of the 1992 NBA draft , but he and owner Donald Carter could not come to terms on a contract for half of his rookie season. Jackson only played 28 games in 1992–93 , a season that was also ruined by trades, a coaching change and injuries. The Mavericks started 2–27 and fired Adubato on January 13, replacing him with Gar Heard . The Mavericks came dangerously close to setting the all-time worst record in NBA history (at the time, 9–73 by the 1972–73 Philadelphia 76ers ). But when Jackson was signed on March 3, the Mavs rallied, closing the season with a 7–14 mark, including two straight wins to end the season and finish 11–71, which was the second-worst record in NBA history. , Dallas selected Kentucky forward Jamal Mashburn with the fourth overall pick of the 1993 NBA draft and hired Quinn Buckner as coach. Part of the problem was that Buckner decided from the start to be a disciplinarian on the model of his college coach, Bobby Knight . [ citation needed ] The mostly young roster did not respond very well to Buckner's stern coaching style, and started 1–23. By the end of January they were 3–40, and it was once again possible that they could tie the 1973 Sixers for the all-time worst record in the league. But 5–9 records in February and April, coupled with Buckner loosening the reins a little bit, helped the Mavs finish 13–69. It was still by far the worst record in the league, but the Mavericks again avoided setting an all-time futility record. They did, however, tie the NBA's single-season record for consecutive losses at 20 games (since broken). , Buckner was fired after garnering the worst full-season record for a rookie head coach—a record that only lasted two years, until Bill Hanzlik broke it with the Denver Nuggets . The Mavericks brought back Dick Motta, who had led the franchise to some of its most successful seasons. The Mavericks also wound up with the number 2 pick in the 1994 NBA draft , and picked up Cal point guard Jason Kidd , giving them a solid tandem of Jackson, Mashburn and Kidd which would become known as "The Three Js". , The addition of Jason Kidd infused the Mavericks with new life in 1994–95 . Kidd averaged 11.7 points, 5.4 rebounds and 7.7 assists in his rookie season, and led the league in triple-doubles. Roy Tarpley was allowed to return to the league after three years and helped with 12.6 points and 8.2 rebounds per game. The tandem of Jim Jackson and Jamal Mashburn combined as the league's highest-scoring pair of teammates. On separate occasions, Mashburn and Jackson scored 50 points in a game that season. Mashburn contributed 24.1 points per game, fifth in the NBA; Jackson averaged 25.7 points, but suffered a severe ankle sprain in February which caused him to miss the remainder of the regular season. Second-year forward Popeye Jones had a great year as well, as he averaged 10.6 rebounds and led the NBA in offensive rebounds. , The Mavericks' improvement was dramatic. They jumped to 36–46, 10th in the Western Conference and only five games behind the Denver Nuggets for the eighth and final playoff spot. It was the biggest one-year improvement in the team's history, and the highest in the NBA that season. Many [ who? ] expected the Mavericks' improvement to continue with the franchise's first foray into the NBA Playoffs since 1990. But despite a 4–0 start, the 1995–96 season was a disappointment in about every conceivable way. [ according to whom? ] For the second time in his career, Roy Tarpley was given a lifelong ban from the NBA for repeated violations of the anti-drug policy—he never played in the NBA again. Jamal Mashburn had season-ending surgery to repair his sore right knee only 18 games into the Mavericks' schedule. , The team's two remaining stars, Jason Kidd and Jim Jackson, bickered throughout the season, though neither of them had any trouble establishing his individual stardom. Jackson led the team in scoring with 19.6 ppg, made 121 three-pointers and was the only Mav to start in all 82 games. Kidd became the first Maverick to be elected a starter in the NBA All-Star Game, and finished second in the league in assists and fourth in steals while averaging 16.6 ppg. George McCloud , who averaged 9.6 ppg in his previous year, blew away his career-high scoring average as the Mavs resorted to the outside shot time and again due to their lack of an inside scoring threat. McCloud averaged 18.9 ppg and made 257 three-pointers, equaling the second-highest individual season total in league history. , Overall, the Mavericks connected on 735 of their 2,039 three-point attempts, both new league records. The Mavs finished 26–56, fifth in the Midwest Division and 33 games out of first place. At season's end, Motta was relieved of his head coaching responsibilities and replaced by former Bulls assistant coach Jim Cleamons . And Don Carter, the only owner the Mavericks had ever had, sold the team to a group of investors led by H. Ross Perot, Jr. , The 1996–97 season was a year of transition for the Mavericks, as they basically re-designed their entire team; 27 different players saw action for that Dallas team, setting an all-time NBA record. By the time the season was over, only rookie forward Samaki Walker remained from the opening-day roster. The first big move came in December, as Jason Kidd, Loren Meyer and Tony Dumas were traded to the Phoenix Suns for guards Michael Finley and Sam Cassell and forward A. C. Green . By far the most important of these acquisitions [ citation needed ] was Finley who, after his first half-season in Dallas, went on to average over or near 20 ppg for at least the next seven years of his Mavericks career. He made two visits to the NBA All-Star Game, and played in each of the Mavs' games until the 2004–05 season. , Don Nelson was hired as Dallas' general manager on February 7. Within a week of his hiring, the Mavs had released Fred Roberts and Oliver Miller and traded Jamal Mashburn to the Miami Heat for forwards Kurt Thomas and Martin Müürsepp and guard Sasha Danilović . Thomas did not play in 1996–97, and only ended up playing in five games as a Maverick before signing as a free agent with the New York Knicks . Danilović played in 13 games for the Mavs before opting out of his contract and signing with Bucker Bologna of the Italian League, and Müürsepp played in 73 games for the Mavericks over the next two years before leaving the NBA. , Chris Gatling was the Mavericks' sole representative in the NBA All-Star Game, but he did not last much longer in Dallas. In one of the largest two-team trades in NBA history, the Mavericks traded Gatling, Jim Jackson, Sam Cassell, George McCloud and Eric Montross to the New Jersey Nets for 7 ft 6 in center Shawn Bradley , forward Ed O'Bannon and guards Khalid Reeves and Robert Pack . Nelson claimed the trades were necessary because the situation in the locker room was unacceptable. However, whereas Cassell went on to become a consistent floor leader and Jackson, Gatling and McCloud all continued to be solid contributors to their teams for several more years, only Bradley lasted any sort of time in Dallas and would spend part of the next eight years putting up modest contributions for the Mavs and giving them solid numbers in terms of blocked shots. , Undrafted rookie guard Erick Strickland averaged 10.6 ppg. He, along with Finley and Bradley, were expected to be the core of this new Mavericks team. The constant changes made it impossible to establish any sort of team chemistry in 1996–97, and the Mavericks finished 24–58. But they had acquired some of the pieces that would help them start to turn things around in years to come. In 1997–98, despite a poor record of 20–62, Dallas had a knack for giving some of the NBA's elite teams a hard time, as they beat the Seattle SuperSonics , New York Knicks , Indiana Pacers and Chicago Bulls . Against the Bulls, Dallas went on a 17–2 run to force overtime, where they won 104–97. Midway through that season, Nelson fired Cleamons and named himself head coach. , In the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season, the Mavericks finished with a lowly 19–31 record, but Michael Finley and Gary Trent put up solid numbers and led their team to their first winning home record (15–10) since 1989–90. Notable were the acquisitions of power forward Dirk Nowitzki and point guard Steve Nash , two seemingly unspectacular moves which would make a great impact in the future. In the following season the team finally "clicked" and started to win on a consistent basis. Led by Finley, the Mavericks earned their first 40-win season since 1989–90. He was greatly helped by Nowitzki, who finally "arrived" in the NBA and established himself as a potent offensive threat. , On January 14, 2000, Ross Perot's group sold the Dallas Mavericks to Internet entrepreneur and season ticket-holder Mark Cuban for $285 million. Cuban immediately set out to revitalize the Mavericks and increase the team's popularity in Dallas and nationwide. His controversial moves (he allowed Dennis Rodman to live in his house for a week before temporarily signing him) and outspoken personality quickly made him a fan favorite in Dallas and garnered the team lots of press in the national media. He has also been fined millions of dollars for violating NBA rules.  , In 2000–01 , the Mavericks improved further and finished with a 53–29 record, fueled by an offensive triangle of Nowitzki, Finley and Nash. The Mavs made a trade minutes before the trade deadline that sent Hubert Davis , Christian Laettner , Courtney Alexander , Loy Vaught , and Etan Thomas to the Washington Wizards for Juwan Howard , Calvin Booth and Obinna Ekezie . This move brought in fresh blood that secured the club's first playoff visit in 11 years. Also, Wang Zhizhi became the first Chinese player to play in the NBA, signing with the Mavs in January, along with the Eduardo Nájera, bringing Dallas an international cast that included Canada's Nash and Germany's Nowitzki. In the playoffs , the Mavericks won in the first round against the Utah Jazz , advancing to the second round for the first time since 1988. Even though they were eliminated by the San Antonio Spurs in five games, it marked a sense of optimism for Dallas in seriously contending for an NBA title. This was also the last season in the old Reunion Arena before making the move to the modern American Airlines Center . , These years also saw Nowitzki win the first two of his unprecedented five consecutive Euroscar Awards as the top player in Europe, in 2002 and 2003. (This award is presented at the end of a calendar year, as opposed to the end of the season as in the NBA awards.) , The 2001–02 season was a great season for the Mavericks, with a 57–25 record and many sellout crowds in the American Airlines Center . This season also saw a change in logo and colors, changing from the cowboy hat logo and green to a new horse logo. In addition, the team gained sleeker uniforms. Another blockbuster trade sent Juwan Howard , Tim Hardaway and Donnell Harvey to the Denver Nuggets in exchange for Raef LaFrentz , Nick Van Exel , Tariq Abdul-Wahad and Avery Johnson , the Mavericks also made several attempts to sign the Utah Jazz 's star Karl Malone . The Mavericks swept the Minnesota Timberwolves in the playoffs but lost again in the second round, this time to the Chris Webber -led Sacramento Kings . , But it was only in the next season that the Mavericks finally broke through. They started the 2002–03 season with a 14–0 record, which was one win shy of tying the NBA record set by the 1993–94 Houston Rockets (15–0). The Mavericks finished with a 60–22 record in the regular season, astonishing fans and critics with their sparkling offense. Since acquiring the "Big Three" of Nowitzki, Finley, and Nash, the Mavericks were a Western Conference power in waiting  and finally led the team to the Conference Finals against the San Antonio Spurs . However, with the series tied 1–1, Dirk Nowitzki, the team's leading scorer, suffered a knee injury in game three that kept him out the rest of the series. This further worsened the Mavs' front-court depth problems (both of their backup centers were injured for the entire series) and the Spurs took the series in 6 games. , In 2003–04 , two blockbuster trades were announced. The Mavericks acquired Antawn Jamison , Danny Fortson , Jiri Welsch and Chris Mills from Golden State in exchange for Nick Van Exel, Evan Eschmeyer , Popeye Jones, Avery Johnson and Antoine Rigaudeau . Another high-profile trade sent Raef LaFrentz, Chris Mills and Jiri Welsch to Boston for Antoine Walker and Tony Delk . Although the team struggled with chemistry, the Mavericks easily qualified for the playoffs. With the trio Nowitzki-Finley-Nash and NBA Sixth Man of the Year Jamison, the Mavericks continued their reputation as the best offensive team in the NBA. Notable were two rookies, Josh Howard and Marquis Daniels , who made an immediate impact. However, the Mavericks were eliminated quickly in the playoffs , losing in the first round to the Chris Webber -led Sacramento Kings , a team which clearly played better defense. The Mavericks management had to re-evaluate their strategy. , The 2004–05 season saw trades which (among others) brought in burly center Erick Dampier , combo guard Jason Terry , speedy rookie point guard Devin Harris , scoring machine Jerry Stackhouse , and defensive stalwart Alan Henderson . Although the loss of All-Star Steve Nash via free agency visibly hurt the Mavericks' offense, the new acquisitions strengthened the team defense. The run-and-gun style of former times changed into a more balanced style of play. At the All-Star break, the Mavericks acquired Keith Van Horn for Calvin Booth and Henderson, the latter resigning only days later. Nowitzki added his third consecutive Euroscar during this season as well. On March 19, longtime coach Don Nelson resigned and his assistant Avery Johnson succeeded him. Under Johnson's tutelage, the defense of the Mavericks became stronger and they easily qualified for the playoffs with an impressive 58–24 record. The Mavericks defeated the Houston Rockets in Round 1 of the playoffs in 7 games but then lost to the Phoenix Suns 4–2, led by former Maverick star Steve Nash . , Prior to the 2005 NBA Draft , the Mavericks had traded all their picks away and were left empty-handed. On August 15, 2005, veteran guard Michael Finley was waived under the new "Allan Houston Rule".  Under that rule, the Orlando Magic waived Doug Christie , who then signed with the Mavericks. On August 19, the Mavericks held a press conference announcing they had re-signed Darrell Armstrong , and introduced Christie, DeSagana Diop , Rawle Marshall , and Josh Powell as new Mavericks. Christie's playing time was very limited amid a surgically repaired ankle still hampering his play. He was waived on November 25, 2005. At the end of calendar 2005, Nowitzki achieved a rare double by winning both the Euroscar and Mr. Europa , a second prestigious award for the top European player. He additionally was named the inaugural FIBA Europe Player of the Year . , Up until the very end of the season, the Mavericks were toe-to-toe with the San Antonio Spurs for the crown of the Southwest Division as well as the #1 spot in the Western Conference. However, they fell short of the title and had to settle for a fourth seed. Nonetheless, they once again achieved a 60–22 record, with Avery Johnson winning NBA Coach of the Year honors. In the playoffs , they swept the Memphis Grizzlies , leading to a titanic series against their state rivals and the reigning NBA champions the San Antonio Spurs. Five out of the seven games were decided in the last minute, including a Game 7 that had to go into overtime, with the Mavs prevailing under the guidance of Dirk Nowitzki and an incredibly deep bench. The Mavericks were able to advance to the Conference Finals against former teammate Steve Nash and the Phoenix Suns . The Mavs' defense and depth enabled them to take the series, as they defeated the Phoenix Suns in game 6 of the Western Conference Finals on June 3, 2006 in the US Airways Center in Phoenix , and the Mavs advanced to their first NBA Finals in franchise history. , In the NBA Finals, the Mavericks faced the Miami Heat , held home-court advantage and scored two convincing wins. After game 2, Dallas city officials had already planned the victory parade. However, in Game 3, the Mavs blew a late double-digit lead, courtesy of Heat guard Dwyane Wade . He carried the Heat to the win, with Nowitzki missing a potentially game-tying free throw in the last seconds. After getting blown out in Game 4, the Mavericks suffered another loss in Game 5 when Wade scored the game-tying basket in the last possession of regular time, putting the Heat ahead with last-second free throws in overtime. The tragic figure was Josh Howard , who missed a pair of clutch free throws in overtime and mistakenly called an early timeout, so the Mavs had to bring in the ball at backcourt rather than half-court for the last possession. In Game 6, the Mavericks took an early double digit lead, but again, Wade poured in 36 points, helped by Alonzo Mourning 's five blocked shots, and the Mavericks lost their fourth game and the title after a string of botched three-pointers. Many Mavericks fans were stunned by the defeat. Mavericks owner Mark Cuban was fined a total of $250,000 for "several acts of misconduct" during the series, and Nowitzki was fined $5,000 for kicking a ball into the stands after Game 5. Nowitzki was also caught by TV cameras attacking a stationary bicycle in the hallway outside of the Mavericks locker room. Jerry Stackhouse was suspended for Game 5 after fouling Shaquille O'Neal on a breakaway dunk attempt. The latter marked the third time a Mavericks player was suspended in the 2006 playoffs. , The Mavericks became only the third team in NBA history (the first since 1977) to lose in the Finals after taking a 2–0 lead. In Game 3, the Mavs held a 13-point lead with under seven minutes remaining but were outscored 22–7 in the momentum-changing 98–96 defeat. The Heat's performance in the last seven minutes represented the team's greatest postseason comeback in team history.  , After an end to their playoff run in 2006, the Mavericks sought retribution in the new season. After an 0–4 start, the Mavericks went on a historic run and posted a 52–5 record over their next 57 games. They finished the regular season with a record of 67–15, good enough to be tied for 6th place all-time, first in the league and the number 1 seed in the Western Conference playoffs . Dirk Nowitzki had a dominant season, further cementing his place as one of the game's elite players; he won his fifth consecutive Euroscar during the season, and was named the NBA MVP at its end. Josh Howard was named to the all-star team. , However, the first-place Mavericks were defeated in six games by the 8th-seeded Golden State Warriors , which is regarded by some as one of the biggest upsets in NBA history, while others don't consider it an upset at all.  The Mavs were exposed defensively, and the Warriors systematically dismantled the Mavericks by exploiting match-ups and preying on Dirk Nowitzki's weaknesses. Former NBA champion and All-Star legend Bill Russell stated in his NBA.com blog that he didn't consider it to be an upset, since Golden State was 3–0 vs. the Mavericks in the regular season. On the year, the Mavericks went 67–12 against the rest of the league and 0–3 against Golden State, giving credibility to Russell's belief that the Warriors' win shouldn't have surprised NBA fans. The Warriors were coached by Don Nelson , the immediate past manager and coach of the Mavericks until he stepped down at the end of 2005–06, and he had been appointed head coach of the Warriors in the 2006–07 mid-season. , Nowitzki's winning of regular season MVP honors and his team's first-round exit created an awkward dilemma regarding the MVP trophy ceremony. Traditionally, the MVP award is given to the winner in a ceremony between the first and second rounds of the playoffs. But it has been believed  that the league opted to put some distance between the MVP presentation and the Mavericks' elimination against the Warriors. By the time Nowitzki collected his MVP award, nearly two weeks had elapsed since the Mavs were ousted in the playoffs. , The Mavericks dealt Devin Harris , two first-round picks and others to the New Jersey Nets for veteran all-star Jason Kidd and other role players, Cuban also tried to sign the free agent Kevin Garnett unsuccessfully. The Mavericks were 3–11 against winning teams since the trade and lost Nowitzki for a little over a week due to a high ankle sprain injury. He returned April 2 in a crucial game against the Golden State Warriors in a 111–86 Mavericks victory and helped defeat the Phoenix Suns in a 105–98 win on April 6. This win in Phoenix was especially significant because the Mavs had been nearly unable to defeat a contending team on the road the entire season. Continuing their playoff push, Dirk hit a crucial three-pointer with 0.9 seconds left, defeating the Utah Jazz 97–94 on April 10. This victory guaranteed them a playoff spot and their 8th consecutive 50-win season. The Mavericks ended the season with a record of 51–31. In the first round of the playoffs, the Mavericks were eliminated once again, by the New Orleans Hornets 4–1 on the road, 99–94. , Just one day after a disappointing season ended, Avery Johnson was dismissed as Head Coach of the Dallas Mavericks. On May 9, 2008, Rick Carlisle was hired as the head coach.      , After getting off to 2–7 start, the Mavericks eventually found themselves with the sixth spot in the Western Conference playoff bracket for 2009 after going 50–32 (ninth consecutive 50+-win season) and about three to four weeks earlier, weren't even sure if they were going to make the eighth and final spot. But a run of 5–1 in their last six regular season games got them to a game over the Hornets for sixth place. Dirk Nowitzki also entered the postseason with a streak of twenty-five consecutive games of scoring 20 or more points, which was ended in the first game of the quarterfinals series versus the arch-rival, San Antonio Spurs . , The Mavericks surprised many people by winning Game 1, 105–97 in San Antonio.  The Spurs quickly won game two in a rout. As the series shifted to Dallas, who had only lost one game there after the All-Star Break, won both Games 3 and 4. San Antonio was just trying to win Game 5 to extend the series, but they couldn't do it as the Mavericks closed out the series with a 13-point-victory, 106–93. With the Victory, the Mavericks advanced to the Conference semifinals for the first time since 2006. , In the semifinals, they faced the two-seeded Denver Nuggets , who were fresh off a 4–1 series win against the New Orleans Hornets , including a 58-point win in New Orleans. The Mavericks stayed close with the Nuggets in the first three quarters of Games 1 and 2, but it was the fourth quarter when Carmelo Anthony and the Nuggets woke up, as they took the first two games by double-digit figures. Game 3 in Dallas was close the whole way, and Dallas led by five points with less than a minute to go. But Carmelo Anthony hit a three-pointer to give the Nuggets a 106–105 victory. The play generated quite a bit of controversy because Maverick guard Antoine Wright clearly fouled Anthony, but since there was no replay used in the NBA in 2009 the Mavericks suffered a game 3 loss. It was later announced by the league that the referees made the wrong call,  but despite that, the Mavericks still faced a 3–0 deficit in the series. , Nowitzki's 44 points in Game 4 saved the Mavericks season, sending the series back to Denver for a Game 5, with the series in Denver's favor, 3–1. Game 5 would prove to be the final game for the Mavericks of the 2009 season, as they would be ousted by a score of 124–110. The elimination led to an off-season facing many questions about the future construction of the team. , After a disappointing loss to the Nuggets in the playoffs, the Mavericks entered the off-season with many questions about the future construction of the team. They began by re-signing Jason Kidd to a three-year contract extension, which took care of their pending point guard issue. The Mavericks also made a move to compound their age problem, by trading for former All-Star small forward Shawn Marion . In a three-team deal with the Grizzlies and Raptors, the Mavericks sent swing-man Antoine Wright along with defensive stalwart Devean George to Toronto, while aging guard Jerry Stackhouse landed in Memphis. Dallas also acquired burly center Nathan Jawai , and Kris Humphries . Many analysts viewed this as a beneficial trade for the Mavericks, being that it countered their age issues, while simultaneously providing them with more depth on the bench.  The Mavericks also added veteran forwards Tim Thomas , Drew Gooden , and Quinton Ross . , These moves proved successful, because after dropping the season opener to the Wizards , the Mavericks went on to beat many contenders such as the Los Angeles Lakers , San Antonio Spurs , Houston Rockets , and the Phoenix Suns which was something that the Mavericks had been unable to do the last two seasons. , A day before the trade deadline, the Mavericks instigated a deal. The trade sent Josh Howard , James Singleton , and Drew Gooden to the Washington Wizards in exchange for Caron Butler , Brendan Haywood , and Deshawn Stevenson . The Mavericks felt that this trade was necessary due to Howard's declining performance and apparent unhappiness with the Mavericks organization. Some NBA analysts felt that this was a good move, because not only did it remove a disgruntled Howard from the line-up, it simultaneously brought Dirk Nowitzki a quality supporting cast, with many believing that the Mavs could contend for a title after the trade went through.   The trade clearly worked, because the new-look Mavericks came out of the all-star break with a vengeance. On January 24, 2010, the Dallas Mavericks routed The New York Knicks 128–78. This was the third largest margin of victory in NBA history. The previous largest margin of victory for the Mavericks was 45 points. After dropping the second-half opener to the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Mavericks went on to win 13-straight games before losing to the New York Knicks. On April 10, the Mavericks clinched the Southwest division after defeating the Portland Trail Blazers 83–77. The Mavericks finished the season with a 55–27 record, good enough for the second seed in the Western Conference. The Mavericks then entered the post-season with quite a bit of optimism and an assurance that they could seriously contend for a title. , During the playoffs though, this optimism proved to be short lived, because after winning game one 100–94, behind Nowitzki's 36-point performance, the Mavericks dropped the next three games to their in-state rivals, the San Antonio Spurs, before winning game five. Dallas would eventually lose against San Antonio in six games 97–87, leading to yet another off-season full of speculation, mostly centering around franchise player Dirk Nowitzki's pending free agent status. , After yet another first round melt-down, the Mavericks began an unexpectedly early off-season. The first order of business for Mark Cuban and the Mavericks was to re-sign Dirk Nowitzki , and they did so on July 4, 2010, when the Mavericks and Nowitzki agreed to a four-year deal worth $80 million. On July 13, the Mavericks, after losing the opportunity to sign LeBron James , Dwyane Wade , or Amar'e Stoudemire , acquired centers Tyson Chandler and Alexis Ajinca from the Charlotte Bobcats for center Erick Dampier , forward Eduardo Najera and guard Matt Carroll . , The 2010–11 campaign saw the Mavericks fly out of the gate, winning 24 out of their first 29 games. However, on December 27, Dirk Nowitzki sustained a knee injury that derailed the Mavericks momentum, combined with the team's second-leading scorer Caron Butler suffering a season-ending knee injury himself only four nights later, raising questions of if the Mavericks could make it 11 straight 50-win seasons. The Mavericks then went on to drop their next seven games, causing serious concern as to who would lead the offense in Nowitzki's absence. This however would prove to only be a temporary setback because Nowitzki only missed nine games, and admittedly rushed back to assist the Mavericks' reeling offense, and consequently they quickly returned to their winning ways. The Mavericks re-invented their defensive reputation around the league during the 2010–11 campaign, mostly in part to off-season acquisition Tyson Chandler (who was later named to the All-Defensive Second Team).  The Mavericks battled the San Antonio Spurs all season long for the division title, but instead settled for the 3rd seed, with a 57–25 record. However, due to the Mavericks bad reputation on struggling during the playoffs, many predicted them to be ousted in the first round against the six-seeded Portland Trail Blazers .  Yahoo Sports analyst Adrian Wojnarowski even went so far as to predict a sweep for the Trail Blazers. , The Mavs won games 1 and 2 on their home floor in convincing fashion. However, upon their arrival to the Rose Garden in Portland, problems began to arise. After dropping game three to Portland, the Mavericks blew a 23-point fourth-quarter lead in game four to allow Portland to tie the series at two games apiece. The whispers then began to re-surface that the Mavericks were going to allow another impressive regular season to go down the drain.  The Mavericks then responded, posting back-to-back wins to oust the Blazers in six games. They then met the two-time defending champion Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference Semifinals. This series was the first time that Kobe Bryant had met Dirk Nowitzki in a playoff series and was expected to be extremely competitive; that however did not prove to be the case. The Mavericks shocked the NBA world by winning the first two games in Los Angeles, and took a two games to none lead heading back to Dallas. They then won a thrilling game three in Dallas, courtesy of 32 points from Nowitzki in a 98–92 victory. The Mavericks then provided the perfect "exclamation point,"  crushing the Lakers in game 4 by a score of 122–86. In that game, Jason Terry set an NBA playoff record with nine three-pointers with just one miss, ousting the Lakers in a four-game sweep. The Mavericks then met the upstart Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference Finals. Dirk Nowitzki set the tone in the series in game one with a 48-point performance, with the Mavericks taking game 1 by a score of 121–112. The Thunder then responded with 106–100 victory in game 2. The Mavericks then won the next three games, including a 15-point comeback in game 4, to take the series in five games. The Mavericks claimed their second Western Conference Championship in franchise history, and met the team that defeated them in the 2006 NBA Finals, the Miami Heat . , The Mavs entered the 2010–2011 NBA Finals as underdogs, due to Miami's "Big Three" coming together during the course of the 2010–11 NBA Playoffs. After dropping game one in Miami by a score of 92–84, the Mavs needed more than just Nowitzki to score, with Nowitzki even calling out teammate Jason Terry earlier in the playoffs. In the fourth quarter of game 2 with the Mavericks trailing 88–73, Dallas was desperate to avoid a 0–2 heading back home. Dallas then staged a comeback, going on a 22–5 run to end the game, and stun the Heat with a game two victory, evening up the series at a game a piece. After the series shifted back to Dallas, the Mavericks lost in game 3, with Nowitzki narrowly missing the potential game-tying shot, by a score of 88–86. Dallas yet again showed their resiliency, winning a pivotal game 4 with Dirk hitting multiple big shots down the stretch to tie the series at two. Game 5 was a bit of an offensive showcase, with both teams breaking 100 points for the first time in the series. Jason Kidd and Jason Terry both hit huge shots down the stretch and the Mavericks defeated the Heat with a 112–103 victory, putting them one game from their first ever NBA title. Three nights later, the Mavericks captured their first ever NBA title with a 105–95 victory, completely reversing what had happened in the 2006 NBA Finals. Nowitzki scored 21, including 18 in the second half, and Terry provided 27 points off the Dallas bench. Nowitzki was so emotional after the game that he headed to the locker room before the game had concluded, and had to be coaxed back onto the floor for the NBA Championship trophy presentation. Nowitzki took home the NBA Finals MVP honors, after averaging 26 points a game during the series, shedding the Mavericks label as "soft", and putting an end to the Mavericks post-season futility. , The 2011–12 season was cut to 66 games due to a lockout , which meant the Mavericks had to wait until Christmas Day to raise their first championship banner. During the brief off-season, owner Mark Cuban decided to maintain financial flexibility by letting Tyson Chandler, DeShawn Stevenson, J. J. Barea and Caron Butler go. Chandler signed with the New York Knicks , Stevenson joined the New Jersey Nets , Barea went to the Minnesota Timberwolves , and Butler joined the Los Angeles Clippers . Meanwhile, they acquired incumbent NBA Sixth Man of the Year Lamar Odom via a trade with the Lakers, while signing veterans Vince Carter and Delonte West . , The Mavericks raised their championship banner prior to their Finals rematch with the Heat on Christmas Day, but in what would soon become a mirror image of the 2006–07 Heat 's eventual failed title defense, Miami blew them out in a 105–94 loss, marking Dallas's first regular-season loss to Miami in eight seasons. Things didn't get better for Dallas after starting the season 0–3, losing to the Thunder in a playoff rematch on December 29. As the calendar turned to 2012, the Mavericks started off on a high note, winning 13 of 18 games in January, but they limped to a 22–22 record the rest of the way, eventually finishing 7th with a 36–30 record, their lowest finish since the 2007–08 season. Nowitzki produced 21.6 points, 6 rebounds and 45.7% shooting, his lowest numbers since the 2000–01 season. Meanwhile, Odom proved to be a bad fit for the Mavericks, and they decided to sit him out for the final two months of the season. , In a rematch from the previous year, the Mavericks faced the Oklahoma City Thunder in the first round of the 2012 NBA Playoffs . Games 1 and 2 went down the wire, but the Mavericks fell short on both occasions as Kevin Durant bailed the Thunder out with a game-winning jumper in Game 1, and with late-game free throws in Game 2. Back in Dallas for Game 3, the Mavericks fell flat throughout the game and suffered a 95–79 defeat to fall behind 0–3. With their backs against the wall in Game 4, the Mavericks led for much of the second half, but James Harden 's 15-point fourth quarter rallied the Thunder to a 103–97 win and eliminated the Mavericks from contention. It marked the first time Dallas was swept in a seven-game series, and they became the third defending champion to be swept in the first round after the aforementioned 2006–07 Heat and the 1956–57 Philadelphia Warriors. , During the 2012 off-season, the Mavericks lost both Jason Kidd and Jason Terry to free agency. Kidd signed with the New York Knicks, while Terry joined the Boston Celtics . Brendan Haywood was later amnestied before moving to the Charlotte Bobcats . The Mavericks acquired Darren Collison from the Indiana Pacers and signed O. J. Mayo from the Memphis Grizzlies . Also joining the team were former All-Stars Chris Kaman and Elton Brand . , The 2012–13 season was a struggle for the Mavericks, as Nowitzki recovered from knee surgery and missed 29 games. In addition, Collison was inexperienced at the point, leading the Mavericks to sign veteran Derek Fisher for nine games,  before settling on Mike James . Mayo was the team's leading scorer for the first two months of the season before Nowitzki's return saw his averages dip. Kaman and Brand were also hounded by injuries. The Mavericks were 23–29 at the All-Star break, before making a late push for a playoff berth. Still, it did not save their season, and the Mavericks missed the playoffs for the first time since 2000. , During the 2013 off-season, the Mavericks chose not to re-sign role players Collison, Brand, and Kaman. Mayo then declined to exercise his player option, and later signed with the Milwaukee Bucks . The Mavericks signed José Calderón from the Detroit Pistons and Monta Ellis from the Bucks. They also signed veteran Samuel Dalembert . , On April 4, 2014, the Mavericks swept the season-series with the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time since the 1980–81 season with a 107–95 win.  , The Mavericks finished 49-33, one game ahead of Phoenix for the eighth and final playoff spot, which meant that they would once again have to face their in-state rivals, the San Antonio Spurs, who were the top seed in the Western Conference with a 62-20 record. In Game 1 in San Antonio, Dallas had an 81-71 lead in the fourth quarter, but the Spurs rallied back and took Game 1, 85-90. However, the Mavs forced 22 turnovers in Game 2 to rout the Spurs 113-92, splitting the first two games before the series went to Dallas. In Game 3, Manu Ginobili hit a shot that put the Spurs up 108-106 with 1.7 seconds left, but a buzzer-beater by Vince Carter gave the Mavs the victory, putting them up 2–1 in the series. The Spurs took Game 4 in Dallas 93–89 despite a late Dallas comeback after the Spurs at one point had a 20-point lead and later won Game 5 at home, 109-103, giving them a 3-2 series lead. The Mavs avoided elimination in Game 6 at home by rallying in the fourth quarter, winning 111–113. Game 7 was on the Spurs home court, and the Spurs beat the Mavericks 119-96, putting an end to the Mavericks' season. , In the 2014 off-season, the Mavericks made several moves, the first of which was trading for Tyson Chandler and Raymond Felton from the New York Knicks, sending Calderón, Dalembert, Shane Larkin, and Wayne Ellington as well as two second-round draft picks, on June 26, 2014, right before the draft. Nowitzki also took a generous discount, re-signing for three years and $25 million, which helped Dallas sign restricted free agent Chandler Parsons from the Houston Rockets to a three-year contract at $46 million. Devin Harris was re-signed, for four years and $16 million. Dallas brought in Richard Jefferson , Al-Farouq Aminu , Jameer Nelson , Greg Smith to build a deep bench. The Mavs' sixth man, Vince Carter, left in free agency to the Memphis Grizzlies. , On November 13, 2014, the Mavericks recorded their largest victory ever with a 123–70 win over the Philadelphia 76ers. The 53-point margin for Dallas surpassed its 50-point win over the New York Knicks in January 2010.  Two days later, they scored 131 points to record their biggest point tally since 2009 in the win over the Minnesota Timberwolves.  , On December 18, 2014, the Mavericks sent Jae Crowder , Jameer Nelson, Brandan Wright, a 2015 first-round pick and a 2016 second-round pick to the Boston Celtics for Rajon Rondo and Dwight Powell .  , On April 28th, 2015, the Mavericks were knocked out of the first round by their in state rivals, the Houston Rockets, in a 4-1 series loss. After going down 3-0 in a Game 3 overtime, the Mavericks managed to win one on their homecourt before losing in Houston in the clinching game, 103-94. The Mavericks were the seventh seed in the playoffs and finished the season 50-32. , During their expansion season of 1980–81 , the Mavericks road uniform colors were royal blue with green and white trim, but the green and blue were reversed a year later, and green was the dominant road uniform color through 1992. However, in the 1992–93 season, they went back to their original road uniform scheme from their expansion season, with minor alterations to the "Dallas" script, a design that the Mavericks used until 2001. From 1980–2001, the home white uniforms had "Mavericks" in blue, with green and white trim, with a few minor alterations to the "Mavericks" script during the 1990s.  The 1980s green road jerseys were revived in the 2004–05 season as part of the Mavericks' 25th anniversary. However, while the lettering from the 1980s uniform was present, the number scheme resembled the 1993–2001 uniforms. , In the 2001–02 NBA season , the Mavericks drastically updated their logos and uniforms, with a new Dallas Cowboys -inspired color scheme of midnight blue, royal blue and silver. The new uniforms consist of a "Dallas" script on both the home and road jerseys. On the home jersey, "Dallas" is in midnight blue across the chest and the numbers are in royal blue with silver trim, while on the road jersey, "Dallas" is in white, with the numbers in silver and white trim. , In the 2003–04 NBA season , the Mavericks debuted their shiny silver alternate uniforms, with "Mavericks" in white and royal blue trim, with blue numerals. However, it proved to be unpopular with fans (thus derisively nicknamed the 'Trash Bags'), and it was scrapped after just one game (at Lakers on October 28, 2003). , In the 2004–05 NBA season , the Mavericks introduced an alternate green uniform similar to their 1980s road uniforms. They were designed by rapper Sean "P. Diddy" Combs , and featured "Mavs" in white on the front side of the jersey with blue trim, and the numbers in silver with white trim above the script on the left chest. , On September 21, 2009, the Mavericks unveiled a new alternate royal blue uniform with the same "Mavs" script, replacing the green uniform. The said uniform will also be used for the NBA's Noche Latina promotion, with the wordmark "Los Mavs.".  , On August 19, 2010, the Mavericks unveiled yet another change to their uniform set, with a new royal blue road uniform that displays the "Dallas" script in navy blue with silver numbers, both with white trim. The alternate royal blue uniform was retired as a result and this new uniform has replaced the midnight blue one as the main road uniform.  However the 'Los Mavs' uniforms are still in use despite the change, but would be the last time the Mavericks participated in the 'Noche Latina' uniform events. , On December 13, 2011, during media day, the Mavericks unveiled an alternate uniform based on the last alternate uniform they wore in the 2009–10 season, except that the base color is navy blue and the number is positioned below the team nickname 'Mavs' rather than above, effectively reversing roles. , There have been nine  head coaches for the Mavericks franchise. The franchise's first head coach was Dick Motta , who served for two non-consecutive stints and coached for nine seasons with the Mavericks. Motta is the franchise's all-time leader for the most regular-season games coached (738); Don Nelson , Donnie Nelson's father, is the franchise's all-time leader for the most regular-season game wins (339); Avery Johnson is the franchise's all-time leader for the most playoff games coached (47), the most playoff-game wins (23), and the highest winning percentage in the regular season (.735). Nelson is also named one of the top 10 coaches in NBA history .  Johnson was the first coach to win the Western Conference championship, losing the 2006 NBA Finals to the Miami Heat .  Johnson is also the only Mavericks coach to have won the NBA Coach of the Year Award , having won it in the 2005–06 season .  Quinn Buckner and Jim Cleamons have spent their entire NBA coaching careers with the Mavericks. Only one of the Mavericks coaches, Don Nelson , has been elected into the Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach .  Rick Carlisle has been the head coach of the Mavericks since 2008.  Carlisle led the team to their first championship in franchise history in 2011, against their 2006 Finals opponent, the Miami Heat , in a rematch. , The Mavericks-Heat rivalry is a testament to when the two teams faced each other in the NBA finals on two separate occasions. First they came head to head in the 2006 NBA Finals , in which the two teams captured their first respective conference titles. The Mavericks came into the series 60–22 with a strong group of players while the Miami Heat came in with a respectable 52–30 record and sported an aging but still strong Shaquille O'Neal as well as an up-and-coming Dwyane Wade . Dallas was favored by many in the media to win the series. The Dallas Mavericks won the first two games but Miami went on to sweep the next four and win the NBA championship for the first time in team history. , Both teams would go on to have success over the next few seasons and would appear in the playoffs many times, and the two teams would go on to have a rematch in the 2011 NBA Finals . It was the first time for both teams since 2006 that they would enter the Finals. This time, however, Miami was favored to win after a highly publicized event when Miami signed LeBron James and Chris Bosh to their roster. Dallas came in 57–25 while the Heat came in 58–24. Miami won the first game 92–84, but Dallas went on to win four of the next five and upset the Heat to win the first title in the Mavericks's history. , The Mavericks-Spurs rivalry is relatively new but very fierce. It features two teams with Dallas roots—the Spurs began their life in the ABA as the Dallas Chaparrals and did not move to San Antonio until 1973. On October 11, 1980, the Mavs made their NBA debut by defeating the Spurs 103–92. In the playoffs the Spurs defeated the Mavericks in 2001, 2003, 2010, and 2014; while the Mavericks defeated the Spurs in 2006 and 2009. The Spurs have won five championships and six conference titles, while the Mavericks have won one championship and two conference titles. The Spurs have won 15 division titles, while the Mavericks have won 3. Both the Spurs and the Mavericks have 3 60-win seasons. , The two teams met in the playoffs during the 2000–2001 season with the Spurs winning in five games. Little was made during this series, as the Spurs won their first NBA championship only two years before. The Mavericks, run by a trio of Steve Nash , Michael Finley , and Dirk Nowitzki , had just defeated the Utah Jazz despite not having home court advantage and were only starting to meld into a title contender. , The two teams met again in 2003 in the Western Conference Finals. Both the Spurs and the Mavericks had 60-win seasons and reached the Western Conference Finals after defeating the Los Angeles Lakers and the Sacramento Kings , respectively. Despite having the best season of their history, the Mavericks fell in six games to the Spurs. , The rivalry took on a new meaning in 2005 when, near the end of the regular season, Don Nelson would resign as head coach of the Mavericks, apparently satisfied with the state of the team, and hand the coaching reins to former Spur Avery Johnson , the point guard of the 1999 NBA champion Spurs team who hit the game-winning shot against the New York Knicks . Since Johnson was coached under Spurs' Head Coach Gregg Popovich , he would be familiar with most, if not all, of Popovich's coaching style and philosophy. During the 2005 offseason, Michael Finley , waived by the Mavericks under the amnesty clause, joined the Spurs in search for the elusive title. , During the 2006 playoffs the two rivals met again. San Antonio won the first game at home 87–85. The Mavericks got revenge the next game winning 113–91 evening the series up at 1–1. The Mavericks won a dramatic Game 3 by one point 104–103. Though Manu Ginobili could have made the basket with five seconds remaining, he committed an error allowing the ball to bounce away from him with one second remaining. Dallas won a tightly-contested Game 4 123–118 in overtime. Game Five was won by one point with the Spurs taking the victory. In the final seconds of that game, Jason Terry was seen punching former teammate Michael Finley under the belt. This would lead to his suspension in Game 6. He was sorely missed in Game 6 as the Spurs took the series back home for a Game 7. In the crucial Game 7, with 2.6 ticks to go, Nowitzki converted a three-point play to force overtime. Manu Ginóbili , the one who fouled Dirk was the same person who gave San Antonio their first lead one possession earlier. Tim Duncan, who had played in all 48 minutes of regulation was too fatigued to carry his team in overtime. The Mavericks, meanwhile, were set to take control of the game and they did just that winning the game 119–111. The Mavericks went on to the Conference Finals where they defeated the Suns in six games, but succumbing to the champion Heat in the NBA Finals. , Despite much anticipation of a renewed meeting in the 2007 Western Conference finals, the Mavericks lost to the Golden State Warriors in one of the greatest upsets in NBA history.The Spurs won the NBA finals after beating the Cleveland Cavaliers 4–0.  The eighth seed Warriors, who made the playoffs on the last game of the NBA season, defeated the 67-win, first-seed Mavericks in six games.  Meanwhile, the Spurs would ultimately go on to win the 2007 NBA Championship, establishing themselves as a true NBA dynasty.     The season also gave longtime former Maverick Michael Finley his first championship. Many Spurs teammates claimed that the drive to win this season was partially to give Finley his first championship, especially since Finley had lost a bitter-fought series to his longtime team the year previous.  , Worth noting in a regular season meeting between the two rivals in April 2007, a game which the Spurs won 91–86, Tim Duncan suffered his first career ejection for supposedly laughing while sitting on the bench. Joey Crawford , the referee who ejected Duncan, allegedly asked Duncan to a fight which led to the longtime ref's season-ending suspension. As Duncan was heading into the locker room, American Airlines Center erupted into a huge cheer, applauding Duncan's ejection. The game was fierce, with Jerry Stackhouse and Manu Ginobili got into an altercation for a rebound, and foul calls going Dallas' way. , In the 2009 NBA Playoffs, the Mavericks and Spurs squared off again in the first round. The Spurs and Mavericks split the first 2 games in San Antonio, but Dallas defeated the Spurs in games 3 and 4, both in Dallas. The Mavericks then went on to close out the series and eliminated the Spurs at the AT&T Center in San Antonio. , In 2010, the Dallas Mavericks matched up against the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the Western Conference Playoffs. Although the Mavericks managed to obtain the number two seed, they were defeated by the Spurs in six games. , During the 2011 playoffs, a role reversal of sorts occurred between the two rivals, when the top seeded Spurs were defeated by the eighth seeded Memphis Grizzlies , the first time an eight seed defeated a one seed since the infamous Mavs-Warriors series of 2007. In addition, the Mavericks defeated the LeBron James-led Miami Heat in the NBA Finals, similar again to how the 2007 Spurs defeated a LeBron James-led Cleveland Cavaliers team in the Finals. , The Mavericks were swept in the 2012–13 season by the Spurs for the first time since the 1998 season , Tim Duncan’s rookie season. In their last match up of the season, San Antonio escaped with a 92–91 victory over Dallas when a Vince Carter 3-point attempt bounced off the rim at the buzzer. With the win the Spurs clinched a playoff spot for the 16th straight season, currently the longest streak in the NBA. San Antonio also reached 50 wins for the 14th straight season, the longest streak in NBA history.  , In the 2013–14 season , the Spurs once again swept the Mavs in the regular season, giving them nine straight victories. In addition, an overtime loss to the Memphis Grizzlies on April 16, 2014 ensured that the Mavericks would face the Spurs once again in the 2014 NBA Playoffs , where the Mavs would be the eighth seed and San Antonio the first. In Game 1 in San Antonio, the game was relatively close. Dallas managed to reach an 81-71 lead in the fourth quarter, but the Spurs rallied back and took Game 1 at home, 85-90. However, the Mavs managed to force 22 turnovers in Game 2 to rout the Spurs 113-92, splitting the first two games before the series went to Dallas. In Game 3, Manu Ginobili managed to hit a shot that put the Spurs up 108-106 with 1.7 left, but a buzzer beater by Vince Carter gave the Mavs the victory, putting them up 2-1 in the series. The Spurs took Game 4 in Dallas 93-89 and later Game 5 at home 109-103, giving them a 3-2 lead. Luckily, the Mavs avoided elimination in Game 6 at home by rallying in the fourth quarter, winning 111-113. The Spurs won game 7 with 119 - 96, eliminating Dallas in the first round. , During the 2004 off-season, former Dallas Mavericks point guard Steve Nash signed a free-agent deal with the 29–53 Phoenix Suns to help out their offense. The addition of Nash helped as Phoenix rolled to a 62–20 record and the best record in the NBA. The teams met in the Western Conference Semifinals with Phoenix having the home-court advantage. , Phoenix won Game One 127–102 with a 40-point game by Amar'e Stoudemire . Steve Nash was also given his NBA MVP award during that game, a game in which he terrorized his former team. However, Mavericks star Dirk Nowitzki hit a game-winning turn-around jumper in Game 2 to beat Phoenix 108–106 to send the series back to Dallas tied 1–1. Phoenix and Dallas split the two games in Dallas which saw both winners of games score 119 points. The series went back Phoenix then took care of Dallas 114–108 in the America West Arena (now US Airways Center). Then, in Game Six, with Dallas facing elimination, Phoenix beat Dallas in a thriller which saw Steve Nash with a 39-point game, to go along with 12 assists. Phoenix then made it to the Western Conference Finals, where they eventually lost to the San Antonio Spurs who then went on to win the NBA Title that season. , The following year, a Suns team without Stoudemire (who was injured), Joe Johnson , and Quentin Richardson , but with a core of new players led by Raja Bell (who clotheslined Lakers star Kobe Bryant in a first-round series game), Boris Diaw and Tim Thomas to go along with Nash and fellow All-Star Shawn Marion . Phoenix had to play seven game series against the two Los Angeles teams, the Los Angeles Lakers (who had a 3–1 lead against Phoenix) and the resurgent Los Angeles Clippers . They faced a Mavericks team who won 60 games, but were forced to be the fourth seed since the division winners got the top three seeds. On their way to the Western Conference Finals, Dallas swept the Memphis Grizzlies , and beat in-state rival San Antonio Spurs in seven tense games. Phoenix won Game One 121–118 after Diaw hit a game-winning shot in the dying seconds of the fourth quarter. Bell, though injured himself in Game One, missing Games Two and Three. After that, Dallas took control of the series, winning Games Two and Three by the scores of 105–98 and 95–88. Bell came back for Game Four and led Phoenix to a 106–86 blowout win. Dallas however, beat Phoenix 117–101 in Game Five which included a 50-point performance from Dirk Nowitzki, and eliminated the Suns in Phoenix 102–93 in Game Six. Dallas would later on lose to the Miami Heat in six games, despite winning the first two games. , On March 14, 2007 in Dallas, Phoenix beat Dallas in a 129–127 double overtime thriller. With the Mavericks up by 7 with a minute left in regulation, Dirk Nowitzki (a 90% free throw shooter) missed two free throws. Steve Nash fed off his mistakes and scored 10 straight points including the game-tying three-pointer with 3 seconds left to go. Dirk Nowitzki's potential game-winning shot bounced off the rim and sent the game to overtime. Jason Terry sent the game into another overtime with a game-tying three-pointer of his own. Dirk Nowitzki's potential game-tying shot in double overtime went in and out of the rim as Amar'e Stoudemire's 41 points were too much for Dallas to handle. , On April 10, 2013, the Mavericks 12-season playoff streak, since 2001 , ended in a loss to the Suns 102–91.  , On April 12, 2014 the Mavs handed the Suns one of three straight losses to keep them out of the playoffs, 101-98. The other losses from rival San Antonio and the Memphis Grizzlies. , An NBA intrastate rivalry, both in Texas linked by I-45, as well as both Dallas and Houston fans traditionally having a disdain for each other's city, the rivalry started when the Mavericks were the last Texas team to join the NBA. In the Mavs' inaugural season in 1980-81, the Rockets won all six meetings including a 116-68 blowout win.  In the playoffs, the Mavericks defeated the Rockets in the 1988, and 2005 playoffs, the latter of which was plagued with allegations of game fixing.  and the Rockets swept several season series with the Mavericks during the 1990s during the Rockets' championship years. On April 11, 1995 the Mavericks were able to get one of their most superb victories against the Houston reigning champion for 156–147 scoring 23 points in the first overtime. Two years later, the Rockets and Mavericks have clashed in their first ever regular season's game played in Mexico City and won by the Rockets 108–106. In recent years the rivalry has once again flourished with Dallas owner Marc Cuban and Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey taking shots at each other on social media, as well as Houston fan favorite Chandler Parsons signing an offer sheet to leave the Rockets to sign with the rival Mavericks for $46M, while making negative statements about the city of Houston upon leaving,  causing massive backlash among Rockets fans. Finally longtime Mavericks player Jason Terry , who was a starter on the Mavs' 2011 championship team, joined the Rockets for the 2015 season , and both teams met in the first round of the 2015 NBA Playoffs , with the Rockets as the 2nd seed and Mavericks the 7th seed, and the Rockets got the best of them 4-1. , The Mavericks hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who isn't signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.  This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. , NBA Most Valuable Player , NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award , NBA Rookie of the Year , NBA Coach of the Year , NBA Sixth Man of the Year , NBA Sportsmanship Award , All-NBA First Team , All-NBA Second Team , All-NBA Third Team , NBA All-Defensive Second Team , NBA All-Rookie First Team , NBA All-Rookie Second , NBA All-Star Three-Point Shootout , Best NBA Player ESPY Award  The Houston Rockets are an American professional basketball team based in Houston , Texas , that competes in the National Basketball Association (NBA). They are members of the Southwest Division of the league's Western Conference . The Rockets play their home games at Toyota Center , located in downtown Houston. The Rockets have won two NBA championships and four Western Conference titles. The team was established in 1967 and played in San Diego , California as the San Diego Rockets , before moving to Houston in 1971 . , The Rockets won only 15 games in their debut season as a franchise in 1967. In the 1969 NBA Draft , the Rockets selected power forward Elvin Hayes first overall , who would lead the team to their first playoff appearance in his rookie season. The Rockets did not finish a season with a winning record until the 1976-1977 season, when they traded for center Moses Malone . Malone went on to win the NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) award twice, and lead Houston to the conference finals in his first year with the team. He also led the Rockets to the NBA Finals in 1981 where they were defeated in six games by the Boston Celtics , led by Larry Bird and current Houston Rockets head coach Kevin McHale . , In 1984 , the Rockets drafted center Hakeem Olajuwon , who would be paired with 7'4" Ralph Sampson , forming one of the tallest front courts in the NBA. Nicknamed the "Twin Towers", they led the team to the 1986 NBA Finals —the second NBA Finals berth in franchise history—where they were again defeated by the Boston Celtics. The Rockets continued to reach the playoffs throughout the 1980s, but they failed to advance past the second round for the rest of the decade. Rudy Tomjanovich took over as head coach midway through the 1991–1992 season, ushering in the most successful period in franchise history. The Rockets would reach the 1994 NBA Finals , where Olajuwon led the team to the franchise's first championship against Patrick Ewing and the New York Knicks . The team repeated as champions in 1995 as the sixth seed in the West and swept the favored Orlando Magic led by a young Shaquille O'Neal and Penny Hardaway . They became the lowest-seeded team in NBA history to win the title. , The Rockets acquired all-star forward Charles Barkley in 1996, but the presence of three of the NBA’s 50 greatest players of all-time (Olajuwon, Drexler, and Barkley) was not enough to propel Houston past the Western Conference Finals. Each one of the aging trio had left the team by 2001, and the Rockets of the early 21st century, led by superstars Tracy McGrady and Yao Ming , followed the trend of consistent regular-season respectability followed by playoff underachievement as both players struggled with injuries. After Yao's early retirement in 2011, the Rockets entered a period of rebuilding, completely dismantling and retooling their roster. The recent acquisitions of franchise players James Harden and Dwight Howard have launched the Rockets back into championship contention. The Rockets, under general manager Daryl Morey , are notable for popularizing the use of advanced statistical analytics (similar to sabermetrics in baseball) in player acquisitions and style of play. , , , The Rockets were founded in 1967 in San Diego, and after being bought by Robert Breitbard for US$1.75 million,  they joined the NBA as an expansion team for the 1967–68 NBA season .  The resulting contest to name the franchise chose the name "Rockets", homaging San Diego's theme of "a city in motion" and the local arm of General Dynamics developing the Atlas missile and booster rocket program .   Breitbard brought in Jack McMahon , then coach of the Cincinnati Royals , to serve as the Rockets' coach and general manager.   The team, that would join the league along with the Seattle SuperSonics , then built its roster with both veteran players at an expansion draft , and college players in the 1967 NBA draft , where San Diego's first ever draft pick was Pat Riley .   The Rockets lost 67 games in their inaugural season,  which was then an NBA record for losses in a season.  , In 1968, after the Rockets won a coin toss against the Baltimore Bullets to determine who would have the first overall pick in the 1968 NBA Draft ,  they selected Elvin Hayes from the University of Houston .  Hayes led the team to the franchise's first ever playoff appearance in 1969,  but the Rockets lost in the semi-finals of the Western Division to the Atlanta Hawks , four games to two.  In 1970 , the Rockets drafted future Hall of Famer Calvin Murphy and future Rockets championship coach Rudy Tomjanovich , who would both play for the Rockets all their careers, and would make the NBA All-Star Team several times.   , Coached by Hall of Fame coach Alex Hannum , the Rockets tallied a 57–97 record in the following two seasons, and did not make the playoffs in either season.   Because of the low performance and attendance, Breitbard looked to sell the team,  and in 1971, Texas Sports Investments, which was led by real estate broker Wayne Duddleston and banker Billy Goldberg, bought the franchise for $5.6 million, and moved the team to Houston .  The franchise became the first NBA team in Texas.  The team's nickname of "Rockets" took on even greater relevance after the move, given Houston's long connection to the space industry.  , Before the start of the 1971–72 NBA season , Hannum left for the Denver Rockets of the American Basketball Association (the Denver Rockets would become the Denver Nuggets in 1974, two years before becoming part of the ABA-NBA merger in 1976),  and Tex Winter was hired in his place.  However, Winter, who said that Hayes had "the worst fundamentals of any player" he had ever coached,  applied a system that contrasted with the offensive style to which Hayes was accustomed. Because of the differences between Winter and Hayes, Houston traded Hayes, who had led the Rockets in scoring for four straight years,  to the Baltimore Bullets for Jack Marin at the end of the 1971–72 season. It was also around this time that the Rockets would use their classic logo used until the end of the 1994–95 season.  Winter left soon after, in the spring of 1973, following the Rockets 10th straight loss,  and he was replaced by Johnny Egan .  , In 1974 the Rockets unveiled their classic uniforms that matched the font of the logo and would be used for the next 21 years. In the 1975 NBA Playoffs they would not only make their first appearance since 1969 in San Diego but also advanced to the second round past the New York Knicks 2 games to 1 and advanced to meet the veteran Boston Celtics , which shut the young Rockets down in 5 games. At that time the Rockets gained popularity in Houston, selling out several home games down the stretch of the regular season as the Rockets battled for a playoff spot and then selling out all of their home playoff games. , In the 1975–76 NBA season the Rockets finally had a permanent home in Houston as they moved into The Summit , which they would call home for the next 29 years. The following season (after missing the 1976 playoffs), under coach Egan's guidance, as well as ABA Newcomer Moses Malone and veterans Tomjanovich, Murphy, and Mike Newlin to help lead the way, the Rockets won the franchise's first division title, the 1977 Central Division title at 49–33, and made their second appearance in the playoffs since arriving in Houston.  After a first round bye for having the second best record in the East, the Rockets defeated the Washington Bullets led by former Rocket Elvin Hayes as well as Bullet stars Wes Unseld and Dave Bing in the Eastern Conference Semifinals 4–2, but lost to the Philadelphia 76ers led by former ABA star Julius Erving 4 games to 2 in the Eastern Conference Finals.  , Early into the 1977–78 season , at a game on December 9, 1977, Kevin Kunnert got into a fight with Kermit Washington of the Los Angeles Lakers . As Tomjanovich approached the altercation, Washington turned and threw a punch that landed squarely in the face of an approaching Tomjanovich, causing numerous fractures in his face.  Tomjanovich spent the next five months in rehabilitation and was not available for selection in the 1978 All-Star Game, and Malone went in his place as the lone Rocket All-Star that season. Rudy-T's averages for the season significantly declined after the injury,  and without the leadership of team captain Rudy-T, Houston finished with just 28 wins in the season, despite an excellent season by Calvin Murphy.  , In the following season , Malone, Murphy, and Tomjanovich all played in the 1979 NBA All-Star Game, and "The Chairman Of The Boards" Moses Malone received the 1979 MVP Award .  The Rockets also sent John Lucas II to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for Rick Barry , who went on to set the NBA record at the time for free throw percentage in a season by shooting 94.7%.  The Rockets went 47–35 in Nissalke's last season as coach, and finished second in the Central Division, but were swept 2–0 against Atlanta in a best-of-three first-round series.  , In 1979 George Maloof , a businessperson from Albuquerque, New Mexico , bought the Rockets for $9 million. He died the following year, and while the Maloof family expressed interest in selling the team, George's 24 year-old son Gavin took over the Rockets. A buyer was eventually found in 1982 as businessman Charlie Thomas purchased the franchise for $11 million. The Maloof period of ownership marked the first dominant period of the Rockets,   led by new head coach Del Harris . In Houston's 1979–80 campaign , Harris led the Rockets to a 41–41 record, tying the San Antonio Spurs for second place in the Central Division.  After the Rockets defeated the Spurs two games to one in their first-round playoff series , they were swept by the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference semi-finals, led by rookie Larry Bird .  , The 1980–81 season marked an NBA realignment caused by the estabilishment of a third team in Texas, the Dallas Mavericks . The Rockets were sent back to the Western Conference , now playing in the Midwest Division .  In Harris's second season, Houston tied with Kansas City for second place in the Midwest Division behind San Antonio with a 40–42 record, and qualified for the playoffs with just one game left.  During the season, Murphy set two NBA records, by sinking 78 consecutive free throws to break Rick Barry's mark of 60 set in 1976, and achieving a free-throw percentage of .958, breaking Barry's record set with the Rockets in 1979.  In the playoffs, Houston began a run that began when they upset Los Angeles two games to one, and then confronting George Gervin 's San Antonio Spurs in a classic Battle of Texas , which would see the Rockets defeat the Spurs four games to three in the Western Conference semifinals, ending in a climactic Game 7 at the hostile HemisFair Arena where Calvin Murphy would score a playoff career-high 42 points.  This resulted in a surprise conference finals matchup with the likewise 40–42 Kansas City Kings, who were led by Otis Birdsong , Scott Wedman , and Phil Ford . When the Kings fell to the Rockets in five games,  the Rockets became only the second team in NBA history (after the 1959 Minneapolis Lakers ) to advanced to the Finals after having a losing record in the regular season, and thus met Larry Bird 's Boston Celtics in the finals round.  However, after blowing a late lead in Game 1 against the Celtics, and actually winning Game 2 at the legendary Boston Garden, the Rockets failed to capitalize on the early surprising success against the favored Celtics, and Houston eventually lost in six games.  , The following season , the Rockets improved their regular season mark to 46–36 but were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs.  Although Malone won the league's Most Valuable Player award in that season,  and new owner Charlie Thomas expressed interest in renewing his contract,  in the following offseason, the Rockets traded him to the Philadelphia 76ers for Caldwell Jones ,  to avoid paying his salary, which was a decision the Rockets were forced to make as they were low on funds due to a declining regional economy at the time.  When the Rockets finished a league worst 14–68,  Celtics coach Bill Fitch was hired to replace outgoing Del Harris,  and after winning a coin flip with the Indiana Pacers to obtain the first pick of the 1983 NBA Draft ,  the Rockets selected Ralph Sampson from the University of Virginia .  , Although the Rockets finished only 29–53 in the 1983–1984 season , Ralph Sampson was awarded the NBA Rookie of the Year award,  after averaging 21 points and 11 rebounds per game.  Houston was again given the first pick of the 1984 NBA Draft , and they used it to select Hakeem Olajuwon from the University of Houston .  In his first season, Olajuwon finished second to Michael Jordan in NBA Rookie of the Year balloting,  and the Rockets record improved by 19 games good for 2nd place in the Midwest division (after Denver) and the third seed in the west, though they were upset in the first round of the playoffs by the sixth seeded Utah Jazz .  In the following season , both Olajuwon and Sampson were named to the Western Conference All-Stars in that year's all-star game ,  and the duo was nicknamed the "Twin Towers".  , The next season Houston won the Midwest Division title with a 51–31 record. In contrast to the other guard-oriented teams of the Western Conference, the Rockets had a high rotation on the position - John Lucas left the team 65 games into the season, Allen Leavell replaced him for twelve games before breaking his wrist, and Robert Reid took over as the starter from the final game of the regular season on. During the playoffs, the Rockets swept the Sacramento Kings before a hard-fought series with Alex English 's Denver Nuggets , including one game going to double overtime in the exhausting altitude of the Mile-High City. The young squad grinded it out and eventually pulled away with the victory over the Nuggets 4–2. When faced with defending champion Lakers in the Conference Finals, the Rockets were ready to knock off their rivals who had the best of them during the regular season. The Rockets, however, were blown out of Game 1 with Olajuwon's spinning reverse dunks and Sampson's alley-oops notwithstanding. Embarrassed by the loss, Olajuwon and the Rockets stormed back to shock the star-studded defending champions with 4 straight wins in an impressive four games to one series victory, a feat that no other Western Conference team had come close to doing against the Showtime Lakers .  , In the NBA Finals the Rockets faced Larry Bird and the Boston Celtics . Boston sportswriters were not happy about not getting a shot at revenge against the Lakers who had beaten the Celtics in the Finals the year before, yet the matchup was interesting with the young front court challenging the playoff-hardened Celtics front court of Bird, McHale and Parish. During the season at the Boston Garden, the Rockets were playing the Celtics well until Sampson suffered a jarring fall on his back. At the start of the Finals, Sampson quickly found himself in foul trouble early in game one as Boston held its serve easily leading 2–0 going back to Houston. Houston won a close game 3 under the leadership of Sampson (and the national anthem sung by one Willie Nelson). Game 4 also went down to the wire with the Celtics pulling it out on late Larry Bird 3 pointer heroics and untimely turnovers by Rockets guard Mitch Wiggins. In a similarly close Game 5 in Houston (under the 2–3–2 format) Sampson inexplicably and unprofessionally succumbed to taunting by the much smaller 6-foot-1 Boston guard Jerry Sichting resulting in Sampson taking a swing and an ejection from the game. Strangely, this fired up the Rockets who won game 5 by 15 points without Ralph thanks to the inspired play of Hakeem Olajuwon, Jim Peterson and Robert "Bobby Jo" Reid. Game 6 went back to Boston with Sampson finding himself again in foul trouble and of little effect against the older and wiser Celtic front court of Bird, McHale and Parish. After the series, Boston coach KC Jones called the Rockets, "the new monsters on the block" with the future looking very bright for the Rockets. During the six-game championship series loss against the Celtics, Sampson averaged 14.8 points on .438 shooting, 9.5 rebounds and 3.3 assists per game.   The Rockets again made the playoffs , and advanced to the second round past favored Clyde Drexler and his Portland Trail Blazers (eventually proving to be their last playoff victory until 1993 ), before being eliminated by the Seattle SuperSonics in Game 6, a double-overtime classic in which Olajuwon scored 49 points in the losing cause.  Early in the 1987–88 season, Sampson was traded to the Golden State Warriors , bringing the Twin Towers era to an end.  Sampson only learned of the trade once he arrived in Houston after a road game.  Sampson's once-promising career was shortened due to chronic knee injuries, which forced his retirement in 1991. KC Jones' prophecy of the Rockets being the "new monsters on the block" never materialized until the early 90's.  , In the next five seasons, the Rockets were either eliminated in the first round of the playoffs    or from playoff contention, with Don Chaney replacing Fitch as head coach in 1988.  Chaney, also a former Celtic, had its best season during 1990–91 , where he was named the Coach of the Year after leading the Rockets to a 52-30 record despite Olajuwon's absence due to injury for 25 games.   The Rockets were once again eliminated in the first round of the playoffs, 3–0 to the Lakers.  While Olajuwon continued to post all-star numbers, he didn't receive the needed support from his teammates. Nevertheless, the Rockets began to rebuild their nucleus that would later make an impact in the years to come, with players such as Kenny Smith , Vernon Maxwell , Robert Horry , Mario Elie , Sam Cassell and Otis Thorpe arriving during this period.  , Midway through the next season, with the Rockets' record only 26–26, Chaney was fired and replaced by his assistant Rudy Tomjanovich, a former Houston player himself.  Although the Rockets did not make the playoffs,  in the next year, the Rockets won-loss record improved by 13 games, as they won 55 games returning to the postseason.  However, the Seattle SuperSonics eliminated them in the conference semifinals in a game 7 overtime loss.  Nevertheless, the 1993 season was a step forward in the team's development, which would materialize the following year. , On July 30, 1993, Leslie Alexander purchased the Rockets for $85 million.  In Tomjanovich's second full year as head coach, the Rockets began the 1993–94 season by tying an NBA record with a start of 15–0.  Led by Olajuwon, who was named the MVP and Defensive Player of the Year ,  the Rockets won a franchise-record 58 games.   The Rockets recovered from being two games down to the Phoenix Suns in the second round of the playoffs ,  to advance to the finals .  Houston was once again down by three games to two to the New York Knicks , but they managed to win the last two games on their home court, and claim their first championship in franchise history.  Olajuwon was awarded the Finals MVP , after averaging 27 points, nine rebounds and four blocked shots a game, and after close to a quarter of a century associated with the Rockets, Rudy Tomjanovich finally won a championship ring as head coach.  , The Rockets initially struggled in the first half of the 1994–95 season ,  and ended up winning only 47 games, which was 11 games lower than their previous year's total.   In a midseason trade with Portland , the Rockets obtained guard Clyde Drexler , a former teammate of Olajuwon at the University of Houston ,  in exchange for Otis Thorpe .  Houston entered the playoffs as the sixth seed in the Western Conference, but managed to defeat the 60–22 Utah Jazz in the first round.  They fell behind 3–1 to the 59–23 Phoenix Suns in the second round, but won three straight to win the series, and became the first team in NBA history to overcome both a 2–0 and 3–1 series deficit in a seven-game series.  The Rockets then beat the 62–20 San Antonio Spurs in the conference finals,  to reach the Finals against the Orlando Magic , led by Shaquille O'Neal and Anfernee "Penny" Hardaway .  When Houston swept the series in four straight games,  they became the first team in NBA history to win the championship as a sixth seed, and the first to beat four 50-win teams in a single postseason en route to the championship.  Olajuwon, who had averaged 35.3 points and 12.5 rebounds against the Spurs and regular-season MVP David Robinson in the conference finals,  was named the Finals MVP, becoming only the second player after Michael Jordan to win the award two years in a row.  , The Rockets won 48 games in the 1995–96 campaign ,  in which Olajuwon became the NBA's all-time leader in blocked shots .  They beat the Lakers featuring a brief comeback by Magic Johnson in the first round of the playoffs , but were swept by the Seattle SuperSonics in the second round.  , Before the start of the succeeding season, the Rockets made a dramatic trade that sent four players to Phoenix for Charles Barkley .  The resulting "Big Three" of Olajuwon, Drexler, and Barkley led the Rockets to a 57–25 record,  and Houston swept Minnesota in the first round . However, after a 7-game battle with Seattle, the Rockets fell in the Western Conference finals to the Utah Jazz 4-2 on a dramatic last-second shot by John Stockton , the Jazz being a team they had beaten on their way to championships in 1994 and 1995.  Despite not winning the NBA championship that year, the 1996-97 season is still considered as one of the team's greatest moments in franchise history. , The 1997–98 season was marked by injuries,  and the team finished 41–41 with the 8th seed in the Western Conference.  Houston once again faced the Jazz, this time in the first round, and they lost the series 3–2.  Drexler retired after the season,  and the Rockets made another bold trade to bring in Scottie Pippen to take his place.  In the strike-shortened 1998–99 season , the Rockets went 31–19, but lost to the Lakers in the first round 3–1 of the playoffs .  After the 1999 draft , the Rockets traded for the second overall pick Steve Francis from the Vancouver Grizzlies , in exchange for four players and a first-round draft pick.  However, after Houston traded a discontented Pippen to Portland,  and Barkley suffered a career-ending injury,  the rebuilt Rockets went 34–48 and missed the playoffs,  for only the second time in 15 years.  , In the 2000–01 season , the Rockets worked their way to a 45–37 record. However, in a competitive Western Conference where seven teams won 50 games, this left the Rockets two games out of the playoffs.  In the following offseason, a 38-year old Olajuwon requested a trade, and, despite stating their desire to keep him, the Rockets reached a sign-and-trade agreement, sending him to the Toronto Raptors .  The ensuing 2001–02 season —the first without Hakeem in two decades—was unremarkable, and the Rockets finished a disappointing 28–54.  , However, after Houston was awarded the first overall pick in the 2002 NBA Draft , they selected Yao Ming , a 7-foot 6 inch Chinese center.  The Rockets' record improved by 15 games,  but they missed the playoffs by one game.  , In the 2003-04 season , Houston began playing in their new arena, the Toyota Center ,  and redesigned their uniforms and logo.  Before the season, Rudy Tomjanovich resigned as head coach after being diagnosed with bladder cancer , ending a 33-year association with the franchise—including its first 32 years in Houston.  Former Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy succeeded him.  The Rockets finished the regular season with a record of 45–37,  and earned their first playoff berth since 1999,  but the Lakers again handed the Rockets a loss in the first round.  In the offseason, Houston saw major changes in the roster as the Rockets acquired Tracy McGrady in a seven-player deal with the Orlando Magic .  The 2004–05 season saw McGrady and Yao lead the Rockets to their best record in ten years,  finishing at 51–31 and seeded 5th in the Western Conference Playoffs. However, their season ended in the first round of the playoffs as they lost to their in-state rival, the Dallas Mavericks , in seven games,  despite leading the series 2–0.  , The following season was an injury-plagued year in which McGrady and Yao missed a total of 70 games, and the team finished with only 34 wins, missing the playoffs.  The Rockets improved by 18 games the next year , with 52 wins,  but once again lost in the first round after leading 2–0, when they lost in seven games to Utah.  After the loss, Van Gundy was fired,  and the Rockets hired Rick Adelman to replace him.  In the 2007–08 NBA season , despite Yao suffering a season-ending injury for the second time in three years,  the Rockets won 22 consecutive games, which was at the time the 3rd longest winning streak in NBA history .  Houston finished their season 55–27,  but were eliminated for the second year in row by the Jazz in the first round of the playoffs, 4 games to 2.  , For the 2008-09 season, the Rockets signed forward Ron Artest . While McGrady wound playing only half the games before enduring a season-ending microfracture surgery ,  the Rockets ended the season 53–29, enough for the Western's 5 seed. During the playoffs, the Rockets beat the Portland Trail Blazers 4 games to two, winning their first round since 1997.  During the series, Dikembe Mutombo injured his knee, which forced him to retire after 18 seasons in the NBA.  However Yao Ming suffered yet another season-ending injury, this time a hairline fracture in his left foot during Game 3 of their second round series against the Los Angeles Lakers . The Rockets lost the series 4–3.  , During the 2009 offseason, the Rockets lost Artest as he signed with the Lakers,  but signed a Los Angeles departing free agent, forward Trevor Ariza , using the Disabled Player Exception they were granted by the league after it was confirmed that Yao Ming's injury would cause him to miss the entire 2009-10 NBA season .  During a season where McGrady was sent to the New York Knicks , and Joey Dorsey and Carl Landry to the Sacramento Kings , despite great play by Kevin Martin , who arrived from the Kings, and Aaron Brooks , who would eventually be chosen as the Most Improved Player of the season, the Rockets could not make it to the playoffs, finishing 42–40, 3rd in the Southwest Division. At that time, the Rockets set an NBA record for best record by a team with no All-Stars.   The offseason had the Rockets drafting Patrick Patterson , signing free agent Brad Miller , and trading Ariza for Courtney Lee .  , The 2010-11 NBA season started badly for the Rockets, who lost the first five games,  and during the seventh, saw Yao Ming injure his leg during the first quarter.  By December, Yao was examined and discovered a stress fracture which kept him off of the court for another season despite only five games played that far.  By the All-Star break in February 2011, the Rockets were 26-31. Afterwards the team won 15 games out of 20, reaching a winning record and contending for a playoff spot. Back-to-back defeats to the Sacramento Kings and New Orleans Pelicans in April eliminated the Rockets with three games remaining, marking the second straight season out of the playoffs.  The team still finished with a 43-39 record, enough for sixth place in the Eastern Conference but only ninth in the competitive West.  Head coach Rick Adelman left the Rockets right after the season,  and Kevin McHale was named his replacement.  During the offseason, in July, Yao Ming announced its retirement at the early age of 30, due to a series of unfortunate injuries to his foot and ankle cut his career short.  , On the 2011 NBA Draft , the Houston Rockets selected Marcus Morris and Chandler Parsons . During an offseason extended by the 2011 NBA lockout , the Rockets' front office started to plan a roster overhaul,  The strike-shortened 2011–12 season had the Rockets were eliminated from playoff contention during the season's penultimate game against eventual champions Miami Heat .  , During the 2012 NBA offseason, the Rockets made significant changes to their roster. The team arrived at the 2012 NBA Draft with three first round picks, which they used to recruit Jeremy Lamb , Royce White , and Terrence Jones .  A trade with the Oklahoma City Thunder landed Houston reigning sixth man of the year James Harden , along with Cole Aldrich , Daequan Cook , and Lazar Hayward .  The team also signed restricted free agents Jeremy Lin and Ömer Aşık ,   and had 2011 draft pick Donatas Motiejūnas arrive from Lithuania.  Departures included Kyle Lowry in a trade,  Goran Dragić through free agency,  and Luis Scola using their one-time amnesty clause .  Only four players were left from the 2011–12 roster: Chandler Parsons , Greg Smith , Marcus Morris and Patrick Patterson.  During the season Morris was traded for a draft pick and Patterson for Thomas Robinson .   , Harden stepped out of his previous sixth man role and into the starting lineup for the Rockets. During the season opener against the Detroit Pistons, Harden had 37 points, 12 assists, 6 rebounds, 4 steals, and a block in his debut as a Rocket,  and finished the season with an average of 25.9 points a game.  As Houston hosted the 2013 NBA All-Star Game at the Toyota Center, Harden was selected as the Rockets' representative.  Despite being the youngest team in the NBA, the Rockets became one of the highest scoring offenses in the NBA.  Head coach Kevin McHale ran an up-tempo offense that put emphasis on transition baskets, shooting three-pointers, and playing at a fast pace. As a result, the Rockets became one of the highest scoring offenses in the NBA, leading the league in scoring for the majority of the season.  In the post-season , the Rockets fell to the Oklahoma City Thunder in the first round, losing the series 4-2.  , Eager to add another franchise player to their team, the Rockets heavily pursued free agent center Dwight Howard in the 2013 offseason. He officially signed with the Rockets on July 13, 2013.  Led by the new inside-out combination of Howard and James Harden, and with a strong supporting cast including Chandler Parsons, Jeremy Lin, and Ömer Aşık , the Rockets were expected to jump into title contention in the upcoming season.  However, in the post-season , the Rockets were defeated in the first round by the Portland Trail Blazers , losing the series 4-2.  , During the offseason, the Rockets traded Jeremy Lin to the Lakers,  declined to match the three-year, $46 million offer sheet that Chandler Parsons received from the Dallas Mavericks ,  and signed Trevor Ariza for a second stint in Houston.  , The Rockets had an outstanding start to the 2014–15 NBA season , winning the first four games of the season for the first time since the 1996–97 season,  and winning each of their first six games by 10 points or more, the first team to accomplish this feat since the 1985–86 Denver Nuggets.  In December, the Rockets acquired Corey Brewer  and Josh Smith ,  two veterans who added depth to the roster. While the Rockets had many key players miss time throughout the entire season, James Harden took it upon himself to keep the Rockets near the top of the conference; turning him into an MVP front-runner. He became the first Rocket to score 50 points in a game since Hakeem Olajuwon,  as well as the only player in franchise history to record multiple 50 point games in a season.  On April 15, 2015, the Rockets beat the Jazz to claim their first ever Southwest Division title and first Division crown since 1994 , and by completing 56 wins finished with the third-best regular season record in franchise history.  During the playoffs, the Rockets beat the Mavericks 4-1 in the first round, and overcame a 3-1 deficit against the Los Angeles Clippers to win the Western Semifinals and return to the Conference Finals for the first time in 18 years.  The Rockets became just the ninth team in NBA history to win a playoff series in which they faced a 3-1 deficit.  In the Conference Finals, the Rockets were defeated by the Golden State Warriors 4-1.  , List of the last five seasons completed by the Rockets. For the full season-by-season history, see List of Houston Rockets seasons . , Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, % = Winning Percentage , During the four years the Rockets were in San Diego, they played their games in the San Diego Sports Arena ,  which had a seating capacity of 14,400.  In their first season after moving to Houston, the Rockets did not have their own arena, and they played their first two years at various venues in the city, including the Astrodome , AstroHall , Sam Houston Coliseum and Hofheinz Pavilion , the latter eventually being adopted as their home arena until 1975. They also had to play "home" games in other cities such as San Antonio , Waco , Albuquerque , and even San Diego in efforts to extend the fan-base. During their first season, the Rockets averaged less than 5,000 fans per game (roughly half full), and in one game in Waco, there were only 759 fans in attendance.  , Their first permanent arena in Houston was the 10,000 seat Hofheinz Pavilion on the campus of the University of Houston , which they moved into starting in their second season. They played in the arena for four years, before occupying The Summit in 1975. The arena, which could hold 16,611 spectators,  was their home for the next 28 years. It was renamed the Compaq Center from 1998–2003.  For the 2003–04 season, the Rockets moved into their new arena, the Toyota Center , with a seating capacity of 18,500.  In the past fifteen years, the Rockets' attendance was at the lowest in 2002, when their attendance per game was only 11,737, second worst in the league.  However, the Rockets averaged 17,379 spectators in 2008, their best average attendance to date, which was the season of the famous 22-game winning streak .  , When the Rockets debuted in San Diego, their colors were green and gold. Road uniforms featured the city name, while the home uniforms feature the team name, both in a serifed block lettering. This was the only uniform design the Rockets would use throughout their years in San Diego. The Rockets' first logo is of a rocket streaking with a basketball and the team name surrounding it.  , Upon moving to Houston in 1971, the Rockets replaced green with red.  They kept the same design from their San Diego days, save for the change of color and city name. The logo used is of a player with a spinning basketball launching upward, with boosters on his back, leaving a trail of red and gold flames and the words "Houston Rockets" below it.  , For the 1972–73 season, the Rockets introduced the famous "mustard and ketchup" logo, so dubbed by fans, featuring a gold basketball surrounded by two red trails, with "Houston" atop the first red trail and "Rockets" (all capitalized save for the lowercase 'E' and 'T') in black surrounding the basketball. The initial home uniforms, used until the 1975–76 season, features the city name, numbers and serifed player name in red with gold trim, while the away uniforms feature the city name (all capitalized except for the lower case 'T' and 'N'), numbers and serifed player name in gold with white trim.  , In the 1976–77 season, the Rockets modified their uniforms, featuring a monotone look on the fonts and white lettering on the road uniforms. Also worth noting is the use of the font Cooper Black on the player's names. On the home shorts, the team logo is located on the right leg, while the away shorts feature the team name wordmark on the same location. With minor modifications in the number font, this version was used in all four of their NBA Finals appearances, including their 1994 and 1995 championships.  , Following their 1995 championship triumph, the Rockets opted to modernize their look. After a fan contest with over 5,000 entries, the team went with the idea of Missouri City artist Thomas Nash of a rocket orbiting a basketball, which was then reworked by Houston designer Chris Hill.  Nash would later sue the Rockets for breach of contract , given they were using his idea despite not having paid the contest prizes.   The NBA suggested to go with the cartoon -inspired imagery that other teams adopted during the 1990s, leading to a rocket painted with a sharkmouth nose art orbiting a basketball, with the word "Rockets" in a more LCD -inspired livery. Red was retained, but navy blue and silver became the uniform's primary colors. Both the home white and away navy uniforms featured gradient-fading pinstripes and futuristic number fonts, with side stripes of navy fading to red. This was used until the 2002–03 season.   , The Rockets' current logos and uniforms were introduced in the 2003–04 season,  created by New York-based agency Alfafa Studio in association with Japanese designer Eiko Ishioka . The logo is an stylized 'R' in the shape of a rocket during takeoff , surrounded by a red orbit streak that can be interpreted as the central circle of a basketball court. Said "R" inspired the team's new custom typeface, designed so that every single digit could be read well from a distance, whether in the arena or on television. Red went back into being the dominant color, with silver and black as secondary.   In 2009, the Rockets went back to their championship years by unveiling an alternate red uniform, featuring gold numbers and side stripes.  , The mascot of the Houston Rockets in the 1980s was called Booster. From 1993 to 1995, the mascot was Turbo, a costumed man that performed acrobatic dunks and other maneuvers.  In 1995, the Rockets debuted Clutch the Bear as a second mascot, a large teddy bear-like mascot that performs a variety of acts during the games. After eight years of serving as dual mascots, the performer playing Turbo retired, making Clutch the sole mascot for the team.  , The Rockets have developed many rivalries within the Western Conference ever since the team returned there in 1980. Two are interstate rivalries, with the San Antonio Spurs, who moved along with the Rockets after four years with them in the Eastern Conference,  and the Dallas Mavericks, introduced that very season.  Houston faced both Texas teams thrice, beating the Spurs on all occasions and losing twice to the Mavericks.  Other famed rivalries were with the Los Angeles Lakers , that in the 1980s Showtime era only missed the NBA Finals when beaten by the Rockets,  and the Utah Jazz, who the Rockets beat on both championship seasons but were defeated by Utah in five other occasions.  , NBA Most Valuable Player Award , NBA Finals MVP , NBA All-Star Game MVP , NBA Scoring Champions , NBA Defensive Player of the Year , NBA Rookie of the Year , NBA Most Improved Player , NBA Coach of the Year , NBA Executive of the Year , J.

A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who isn't signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.  This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. , See also: List of companies in Houston , See: List of colleges and universities in Houston  The Memphis Grizzlies are an American professional basketball team based in Memphis , Tennessee . They are part of the Southwest Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Grizzlies play their home games at FedExForum . The team owner is Robert Pera . , The team was established as the Vancouver Grizzlies in Vancouver , British Columbia in 1995. They relocated to Memphis in 2001. The Grizzlies are the only team in the four major professional leagues based in Memphis. , , , The Vancouver Grizzlies were a Canadian professional basketball team based in Vancouver , British Columbia . They were part of the Midwest Division of the Western Conference of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The team was established in 1995, along with the Toronto Raptors , as part of the NBA's expansion into Canada. Following the 2000–01 season, the team relocated to Memphis, Tennessee , United States , and were renamed as the Memphis Grizzlies. The Grizzlies played their home games at General Motors Place for the entirety of their 6 seasons in Vancouver. , The Vancouver Grizzlies applied with the NBA to relocate to Memphis on March 26, 2001 and it was granted. As a result, the Grizzlies became the first major professional sports team from the "big four" major pro sports leagues to permanently play its home games in Memphis, as well as leaving the Toronto Raptors to be the only Canadian basketball team in the NBA. Memphis became the easternmost city in the Western Conference. In their first three seasons in Memphis, the Grizzlies played their home games at the Pyramid Arena . , In the 2001 NBA Draft , the Atlanta Hawks chose Pau Gasol as the 3rd overall pick, who was traded to the Grizzlies. Forward Shane Battier was selected with the 7th pick in the same draft by the Vancouver Grizzlies. They also acquired Jason Williams from the Sacramento Kings in exchange for Mike Bibby that same year. After the Grizzlies' first season in Memphis , Gasol won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award . The Grizzlies also drafted Shane Battier , who quickly became an unofficial spokesman for the team and a fan favorite. However, despite the strong draft class, general manager Billy Knight was let go. After Knight's departure and the season, the team hired former Los Angeles Laker and Hall of Famer Jerry West as general manager in 2002, who later received the 2003–04 NBA Executive of the Year Award . After West's arrival the team was changed a great deal from Knight's team, with the removal of Sidney Lowe as head coach after 0–8 start to the season and a great deal of player movement, with players such as Mike Miller and James Posey becoming vital to the team's success. During the 2002–03 season, Hubie Brown was hired to coach the Grizzlies. , Brown won the NBA Coach of the Year Award during the next season when the Grizzlies made the NBA playoffs for the first time in team history in 2004 as the sixth seed in the Western Conference in a drastic change from being perennially one of the worst teams in the NBA. They also won a then record 50 games under Gasol and Williams. In the playoffs they faced the San Antonio Spurs, who swept them out of the playoffs in four games. , However, Brown stepped down as head coach during the 2004–05 NBA season. At the time of his resignation, the Grizzlies had a losing record but West was able to hire TNT analyst and former coach Mike Fratello to replace Brown. The Grizzlies' record improved and the team advanced to the postseason for the second consecutive season. However, the Grizzlies were swept out in the first round again, this time by the Phoenix Suns . After the season, which ended with anger between Fratello and many of the players, namely Bonzi Wells and Jason Williams, the team had an active 2005 off-season in which they revamped the team and added veterans. While the Grizzlies lost Wells, Williams, Stromile Swift , and James Posey , they acquired Damon Stoudamire , Bobby Jackson , Hakim Warrick , and Eddie Jones . They made the playoffs for the third consecutive year as well. , With their record they had the fifth seed in the Western Conference playoffs and would face the Dallas Mavericks , who swept the Grizzlies in 4 games. , Following the 2006 NBA Draft , Jerry West traded Shane Battier to the Houston Rockets for their first round pick Rudy Gay and Stromile Swift . Before the 2006–07 season , they suffered a blow when Gasol broke his left foot while playing for Spain in the World Championships . The Grizzlies started the season 5–17 without Gasol, and then went 1–7 while he was limited to about 25 minutes per game. At that point, Fratello was fired and replaced by Tony Barone, Sr. as interim coach. Barone was the team's player personnel director and had never coached an NBA game though he had coached at the collegiate level for both Creighton and Texas A&M being named coach of the year in their conferences three times during his tenure. , The Grizzlies finished the 2006–07 season with a league-worst 22–60 record, and Jerry West announced his resignation from his position as the team's general manager shortly after the end of the regular season. The team also hired Marc Iavaroni , who was previously with the Phoenix Suns as an assistant coach, to be the team's new head coach. Despite the last-place finish, the Grizzlies, who held the best chance of landing the first pick, ended up with the fourth pick in the 2007 NBA draft , with which the Grizzlies selected Mike Conley, Jr. , On June 18, 2007, the Grizzlies named former Boston Celtics GM Chris Wallace as the team's General Manager and Vice President of Basketball Operations, replacing the retired West.  A few days later, they hired former Philadelphia 76ers and Orlando Magic head coach Johnny Davis , longtime NBA assistant coach Gordon Chiesa , and the head coach of the 2007 NBA Development League champion Dakota Wizards , David Joerger , as the team's new assistant coaches. Gene Bartow was named the Grizzlies' President of Basketball Operations on August 16, 2007.  On February 1, 2008, Pau Gasol was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers for Kwame Brown , Javaris Crittenton , Aaron McKie , rights to Marc Gasol (Pau's younger brother), and 2008 and 2010 first-round draft picks.   , On January 22, 2009, head coach Marc Iavaroni was fired and replaced on an interim basis by assistant coach Johnny Davis for two games. Lionel Hollins was named the Grizzlies' permanent head coach on January 25, 2009.  , On June 25, 2009, with the second overall pick in the NBA Draft, Memphis selected Hasheem Thabeet , then selected DeMarre Carroll with the 27th overall pick. On September 9, 2009, the Grizzlies signed free agent Allen Iverson to a one-year, $3.5 million deal. He only played three games (none in Memphis) before he left for "personal problems". He was then waived by the Grizzlies.   Following Iverson's departure, the Grizzlies improved. With new acquisition Zach Randolph playing at an all-star level, Marc Gasol's improvement, and a commitment to defense, the Grizzlies were in playoff contention for much of the 2009-10 NBA season , before finishing 10th in the West, 40–42. , Going into the 2010–11 season the Grizzlies celebrated the tenth year of basketball in Memphis. The season started with tremendous enthusiasm by the fan base in the Memphis area. Although the Grizzlies and their fans were celebrating the tenth season, the Grizzlies were also cheering for the 8th spot in the Western Conference Playoffs . They finished with a 46–36 record. The Grizzlies found their way back into the post-season for the first time in five years in the 2010–11 NBA season after a 101–96 home victory over the Sacramento Kings on April 8, 2011.  While in the playoff hunt in February 2011, the Grizzlies traded Hasheem Thabeet , DeMarre Carroll , and a protected future first-round pick to the Houston Rockets for Shane Battier and Ishmael Smith . , The team became known locally and nationally for its "Grit and Grind"-style of basketball which means disruptive defense through high pressure on the ball (they were the team with the most steals per game in 2010–11) and inside-out offense (they were the highest scoring team in the paint also). The Grizzlies achieved several firsts in franchise history during the 2011 NBA Playoffs . Entering the playoffs as an eighth seed, the team won their first playoff game in franchise history on April 17, 2011 with a 101–98 victory on the road against the top seeded San Antonio Spurs . Memphis then won their first home playoff game when they beat the Spurs 91–88 on April 23, 2011.  Finally, on April 29, the team won their first playoff series when they beat the Spurs in game 6, 99–91 to win the series 4 games to 2. This was only the fourth time in NBA history that an 8 seed defeated a 1 seed, and only the second time in a best-of-seven series (the first two were in a best-of-five series).  The Grizzlies' historic season came to an end after the Oklahoma City Thunder defeated them in game 7 of the Western Conference Semifinals.  , The team re-signed Marc Gasol and Hamed Haddadi after the 2010–11 season.  , The Grizzlies found their way back into the post-season for the second time in six years in the 2011–12 NBA season after a 103–91 home victory over the New Orleans Hornets on April 18, 2012. They finished the 2011–12 season with a 41-25 record, 4th in the Western Conference. However, they were eliminated in the first round by the Los Angeles Clippers in seven games. , During the 2012 off-season, the Grizzlies drafted Tony Wroten with the 25th overall pick. Their biggest signing in effort to improve their bench was bringing in Jerryd Bayless . They also acquired Wayne Ellington from the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for Dante Cunningham . , On June 11, 2012, Michael Heisley reportedly had an agreement in principle to sell the Memphis Grizzlies to communications technology magnate Robert J. Pera , who at 34 had a spot on Forbes' 2012 list of the 10 youngest billionaires in the world.  The purchase price was in the $350 million range. On August 23, 2012, Pera reached an agreement with a group of local partners including J.R. "Pitt" Hyde, Staley Cates, Ed Dobbs, Duncan Williams and Billy Orgel.   On October 25, 2012, Robert Pera was officially approved as the owner of the Memphis Grizzlies.   On November 4, 2012, Pera named Jason Levien the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Partner of the Memphis Grizzlies.  On December 13, 2012, ESPN announced that John Hollinger was hired by the Grizzlies as their new Vice President of Basketball Operations. , On January 23, 2013, the Grizzlies acquired Jon Leuer from the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Marreese Speights , Wayne Ellington , Josh Selby , and a future first-round pick.  On January 30, 2013, the Grizzlies traded Rudy Gay and Hamed Haddadi to the Toronto Raptors in a three team deal also involving the Detroit Pistons . The Grizzlies acquired Tayshaun Prince and Austin Daye from the Pistons and Ed Davis and a future second-round pick from the Raptors.  , At the end of the season, Memphis finished with their best franchise record of 56-26, 2nd in the Division and as the 5th seed in the Playoffs. Also, Marc Gasol was NBA Defensive Player of the Year. In the opening round, Memphis defeated the Los Angeles Clippers in 6 Games after trailing in the series 0-2. This avenged their defeat from the previous year at the hands of the Clippers. Memphis then went on to the Western Conference finals for the first time in franchise history when they defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder 4-1 in their semi-finals series. This was a rematch of their meeting in the 2011 NBA Playoffs, which the Thunder won in 7 games. However, the Grizzlies' season ended in the conference finals as they were swept by the eventual conference champions, San Antonio Spurs in yet another rematch/reversal from the 2011 NBA Playoffs. , Entering the 2013-14 season , Memphis struggled, starting out at 14-18 with Marc Gasol out, and 29-23 at the All-Star break. They went 21-9 after, getting 3rd in Division and 7th place in the West, 50-32, including a 14 home game winning streak. They faced the Oklahoma City Thunder in the playoffs and had a record four straight overtimes from games 2-5, going 3-1 in the overtimes. The Grizzlies fell 4-3, despite an effort by Gasol in game 7 without Zach Randolph after he was suspended for punching Thunder center Steven Adams in game 6. , On October 29, 2014, the Grizzlies defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 105-101 for the franchise's first victory in a season opener since 2000, the year before the team moved to Memphis.  In the 2014-15 NBA season, the Grizzlies made the NBA playoffs as the 5th seed in the Western Conference. In the first round, the Grizzlies defeated the Portland Trail Blazers in five games. In the second round, they found themselves facing off against the top seeded Golden State Warriors and MVP Stephen Curry . The teams split the first two games, before Memphis took a surprising 2-1 series lead. However, it did not last, and Golden State dispatched the Grizzlies in 6 games. , The Grizzlies hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who isn't signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.  This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. , NBA Rookie of the Year , NBA Coach of the Year , NBA Executive of the Year , NBA Sixth Man of the Year , NBA Defensive Player of the Year , NBA Sportsmanship Award , NBA All-Star selections , Hall of Fame inductees , All-NBA Second Team , All-NBA Third Team , NBA All-Defensive First Team , NBA All-Defensive Second Team , NBA All-Rookie First Team , NBA All-Rookie Second Team , The Grizzlies appear on television on the cable channel SportSouth , owned and operated by Fox Sports Net as a sister station to Fox Sports Tennessee .

He was first introduced in 1995 when the team was in Vancouver .  Grizz was named 2011 NBA Mascot of the Year.   , The Grizzlies launched a program called "Friends of Grizz", with donations and proceedings going to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital . , Despite being one of the youngest squads in the NBA, the Grizzlies are rivals with the Los Angeles Clippers . The Grizzlies and Clippers have been rivals since the 2011-12 season , when the Clippers eliminated the Grizzlies in the first round of the 2012 NBA Playoffs 4 games to 3. The Grizzlies returned the favor in the 2012-13 season , eliminating the Clippers in the first round of the 2013 NBA Playoffs 4 games to 2. There have also been violent scuffles between the players, mainly between the Grizzlies Zach Randolph and the Clippers Blake Griffin . When asked about a rivalry with the Los Angeles Lakers , Clippers center DeAndre Jordan stated, "I don't think it'll ever be a rivalry. You guys [in the media] want it to be, though," Jordan said. "I would say Memphis more than the Lakers. I hate every other NBA team in the league. If anybody [is our rival], I'd say Memphis."  Although the two teams never met in the 2014 playoffs, they still engaged in close, heated matchups in the 2014-15 season. In a Grizzlies home game against the Clippers, the crowd was given flip-flop sandals designating Clippers players as "floppers." , The Grizzlies also have a rivalry brewing with the Oklahoma City Thunder . The two squads have faced each other in the playoffs in 2011, 2013, and 2014. The Thunder beat the Grizzlies in the conference semifinals in 2011 and in the conference quarterfinals in 2014. Each of those two series went to seven games. The Grizzlies handled the Thunder in five games during the conference semifinals in 2013 before getting beat by the San Antonio Spurs in the conference finals that same year.  The New Orleans Pelicans are an American professional basketball team based in New Orleans , Louisiana , that competes in the National Basketball Association (NBA). They play in the Southwest Division of the league's Western Conference . The team plays their home games in the Smoothie King Center (formerly known as the New Orleans Arena). , The Pelicans were established as the New Orleans Hornets in the 2002–03 season when then-owner of the Charlotte Hornets , George Shinn , relocated the franchise to New Orleans. Due to the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the franchise temporarily relocated to Oklahoma City , where they spent two seasons officially known as the New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets . The team returned to New Orleans full-time for the 2007–08 season . On January 24, 2013, the franchise announced it would rename itself the Pelicans.  The name change to the Pelicans took effect after the conclusion of the 2012–13 season . The Charlotte Hornets name, history and records from 1988–2002 were returned to its original city to be used by the then-Charlotte Bobcats franchise, which subsequently became the Charlotte Hornets, starting May 20, 2014.  , In 13 seasons of play since the original franchise relocated from the Carolinas, the Louisiana franchise has achieved an overall regular season record of 498–552, and has qualified for the postseason six times. Their achievements include one playoff series victory and one division title. , , , While the Charlotte Hornets put a competitive team on the court throughout the 1990s, the team's attendance began falling dramatically. Many attributed this lapse in popularity to the team's owner, George Shinn , who was slowly becoming despised by the people of the city.  In 1997, a Charlotte woman claimed that Shinn had raped her, and the resulting trial severely tarnished his reputation in the city. The consensus was that while Charlotte was as basketball-crazy as ever, fans took out their anger at Shinn on the team. Shinn had also become discontented with the Charlotte Coliseum , which, although considered state-of-the-art when it opened in 1988, had by then been considered obsolete due to a limited number of luxury boxes. On March 26, 2001, both the Hornets and the Vancouver Grizzlies applied for relocation to Memphis , Tennessee ,  which was ultimately won by the Grizzlies . Shinn issued an ultimatum: unless the city built a new arena at no cost to him, the Hornets would leave town. The city initially refused, leading Shinn to consider moving the team to either Norfolk , Louisville , or St. Louis . Of the cities in the running, only St. Louis was a larger media market than Charlotte at the time; also, it was the only one of the four to have previously had an NBA franchise — the St. Louis Hawks , who moved to Atlanta , Georgia in 1968. , Finally, a new arena in Uptown , which would eventually become the Charlotte Bobcats Arena (now known as Time Warner Cable Arena ), was included in a non-binding referendum for a larger arts-related package, and Shinn withdrew his application to move the team. Polls showed the referendum on its way to passage. However, just days before the referendum, Mayor Pat McCrory vetoed a living wage ordinance. The veto prompted many of the city's black ministers to oppose the referendum; they felt it was immoral for the city to build a new arena when city employees weren't paid enough to make a living.  After the referendum failed, city leaders devised a plan to build a new arena in a way that did not require voter support, but made it known that they would not even consider building it unless Shinn sold the team. While even the NBA acknowledged that Shinn had alienated fans, league officials felt such a demand would anger other owners.  The city council refused to remove the statement, leading the Hornets to request a move to New Orleans - a move that would eventually return the NBA to that city since the then- New Orleans Jazz moved to Salt Lake City , Utah in 1979. Before the Hornets were eliminated from the playoffs, the NBA approved the move. As part of a deal, the NBA promised that Charlotte would get a new team, which took the court two years later as the Charlotte Bobcats . , In a 2008 interview with the Charlotte Observer , Shinn, who has not returned to Charlotte since the Hornets moved, admitted that the "bad judgment I made in my life" played a role in the Hornets' departure. He also said that if he had it to do all over again, he would not have withdrawn from the public after the sexual assault trial. Shinn emphasized how he was making amends by committing to New Orleans saying, "I've made enough mistakes in my life. I'm not going to make one here. This city needs us here. We're going to make this (New Orleans) thing work."  , The Hornets opened their inaugural season in New Orleans on October 30, 2002, against New Orleans' original NBA franchise, the now- Utah Jazz . In the first regular season NBA game played in New Orleans in over 17 years,  the Hornets defeated the Jazz 100–75, and posthumously retired #7 of "Pistol" Pete Maravich during halftime. The Hornets finished the season with a 47–35 record but were defeated by the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round of the playoffs . Following the season, the team unexpectedly fired head coach Paul Silas and replaced him with Tim Floyd . The Hornets began the 2003–04 season strong with a 17–7 start but sputtered at the end and finished 41–41. They lost to the Miami Heat in the first round of the 2004 playoffs . After the season, Floyd was fired and the team hired Byron Scott as its new head coach. , During the previous two seasons the Hornets competed in the NBA's Eastern Conference . The 2004–05 season saw the team moved to the Western Conference 's Southwest Division . In a season marred by injury to the team's three all-stars, the team finished the year with a franchise-worst record of 18–64. , In the subsequent draft , the Hornets used their first round pick to select point guard Chris Paul out of Wake Forest University . , Because of the catastrophic devastation brought by Hurricane Katrina upon the communities of southeastern Louisiana , the Hornets franchise temporarily relocated its base of operations to Oklahoma City , Oklahoma , in 2005–06 and 2006–07, posting records of 38–44 and 39–43 respectively.  During this time, the franchise was known as the New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets. In these two seasons, most home games were played at the Ford Center in Oklahoma City, while a few remained at New Orleans Arena. One year after the Hornets moved back to New Orleans permanently, the Seattle SuperSonics relocated to Oklahoma City and became the Thunder . , The Hornets franchise returned to New Orleans full-time for the 2007–08 season, with all 41 home games in the New Orleans Arena. The 2008 NBA All-Star Game and its accompanying festivities were awarded to New Orleans and a serious marketing campaign was commenced in February 2007. Healthier than previous seasons, the Hornets raced to a 29–12 record at the halfway mark, completing the regular season with a record of 56–26, making the season their most successful ever. The Hornets also won their first-ever division title, winning the Southwest Division . Having clinched the 2nd overall seed for the Western Conference in the 2008 playoffs , the Hornets beat the Dallas Mavericks in the first round but eventually lost to the defending-champion San Antonio Spurs in seven games in the conference semifinals. , In August 2008 the Hornets unveiled a modified logo and new uniforms with the colors of Creole blue, purple, and Mardi Gras gold. Pinstripes were also added to the uniforms. The Hornets also introduced a new gold alternate uniform in 2010 which was used mostly in games played on Saturday at home and on the road. The Hornets finished the 2008–09 season with a 49–33 record. Paired up with the Denver Nuggets in the first round of the 2009 NBA Playoffs , the Hornets were eliminated in five games. The Hornets started the 2009–10 season in a disappointing fashion, and head coach Byron Scott was fired after a 3–6 start to the season. General manager Jeff Bower took over the head coaching duties for the remainder of the season. The Hornets finished the season with a 37–45 record, finishing last in the Southwest division they had won only two seasons before. Jeff Bower later resigned as head coach, and Monty Williams was brought in as new head coach. The team finished the 2010–11 season with a 46–36 record and qualified for the 2011 NBA Playoffs , where they lost to the Lakers 4–2. , In December 2010 the NBA purchased the Hornets from George Shinn for an estimated $300 million.   , Before the 2011–12 NBA season, the Hornets were considering trade offers for Chris Paul. Paul eventually requested a trade to the New York Knicks . The Hornets looked at many teams including the Boston Celtics and the Golden State Warriors as trade partners, but Paul had made it clear he would only sign with the Knicks, the Los Angeles Lakers , or the Los Angeles Clippers . [ citation needed ] , On December 14, 2011, the Hornets agreed to a deal with the Clippers that would send Paul to Los Angeles in exchange for Eric Gordon , Chris Kaman , Al-Farouq Aminu , and a first-round draft pick acquired by the Clippers from a trade with the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2004. At the end of the 2011–12 NBA season , the Hornets had the worst record in the West, 21–45. , On April 13, 2012, it was announced that Tom Benson , owner of the New Orleans Saints , had purchased the franchise from the NBA for $338 million.   In addition, Benson has announced that he will change the team name to something that would better suit the region, fueling rumors that the Hornets name could one day return to Charlotte, where the Bobcats play.   In June 2012, Benson appointed two senior Saints executives to supervise the Hornets as well: Saints general manager Mickey Loomis became head of basketball operations, overseeing general manager Dell Demps , and Saints business operations head Dennis Lauscha took on the same role with the Hornets.  , The Hornets traded Emeka Okafor and Trevor Ariza to the Wizards for Rashard Lewis , whom they bought out, and a draft pick. , On May 30, 2012, the Hornets were awarded the first overall pick in the 2012 NBA draft and subsequently drafted Anthony Davis . They also drafted Austin Rivers with the 10th pick (acquired from the Clippers as part of the Chris Paul trade). , On July 11, 2012, Ryan Anderson , 2012's Most Improved Player and three-point field goals leader, was acquired in a sign-and-trade by the New Orleans Hornets, with the Orlando Magic , for Gustavo Ayón . , New owner Tom Benson had indicated early in his ownership that he wished to change the team's name to something more local, even preferring that the Utah Jazz - founded in New Orleans in 1974 and played there until 1979, give up the " Jazz " name. But the Jazz indicated they had no interest in returning the name due to over 30 years of history associated with it. Benson had also heavily favored the names "Brass" and "Krewe." , However, on December 4, 2012, it was reported that the Hornets would change their name to the New Orleans Pelicans beginning with the 2013-14 season.  The team name is inspired by Louisiana's state bird, the brown pelican .  , The name "Pelicans" previously had been used by a minor-league baseball team that played in New Orleans from 1901 to 1957.  The Hornets organization officially confirmed the name change in a press meeting held on January 24, 2013, where officials unveiled the team's new logos and navy blue-gold-red color scheme.   On April 18, 2013, after the end of the team's 2012–13 season, the team's name was officially changed to the Pelicans.  , Following the New Orleans franchise's 2013 disestablishment of the "Hornets" name, on May 21, 2013, Charlotte Bobcats owner Michael Jordan officially announced the organization had submitted an application to change the name of his franchise to the Charlotte Hornets for the 2014–15 NBA season pending a majority vote for approval by the NBA Board of Governors at a meeting in Las Vegas , Nevada , on July 18, 2013.  Then-NBA Deputy Commissioner and COO Adam Silver had previously pointed out the fact that the league owns the rights to the name Hornets and that could speed up the process.  The NBA unanimously approved the name change starting with 2014-15.  , On June 27, 2013, during the 2013 NBA draft , the Pelicans selected Nerlens Noel 6th overall, and traded him along with a 2014 protected first-round pick for All-Star point guard Jrue Holiday of the Philadelphia 76ers and the 42nd pick, Pierre Jackson .  At a May 20, 2014 press conference making the Charlotte Bobcats ' renaming to Hornets official, it was announced that the Pelicans agreed to transfer the records and statistics of the original Charlotte Hornets(1988-2002) to the current Charlotte franchise, thus unifying Charlotte NBA basketball history under one franchise; the team records and statistics since the 2002 move to New Orleans would be retained by the Pelicans, retroactively turning the Pelicans into a 2002 expansion team. , For the first time under the name Pelicans, the team qualified for the playoffs with a 45-37 record as the 8th seed. They owned the tiebreaker over the Oklahoma City Thunder by winning the regular season head-to-head series 3-1, and they faced the Golden State Warriors in the first round and were swept. After the season, the Pelicans fired coach Monty Williams despite making the playoffs. , On May 31, 2015, the Pelicans hired Alvin Gentry as the franchise's 6th head coach.  , On August 1, 2013, the Pelicans released their new uniforms.   NBA teams were not allowed to have alternate uniforms during their first season of operation. They have added a red alternate for the 2014–15 season that will be worn 4 times in the year.   , The Pelicans hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who isn't signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.  This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. , Rookie of the Year , Coach of the Year , All-Star West Head Coach , All-NBA First Team , All-NBA Second Team , All-NBA Third Team , NBA All-Defensive First Team , NBA All-Defensive Second Team , NBA Rookie First Team , NBA Rookie Second Team , NBA All-Star , Pierre the Pelican is the official mascot for the Pelicans. He was introduced on October 30, 2013, the opening night of regular season for the team at home against the Indiana Pacers .  The name for the mascot was selected by the fans through an online poll on the team's website. However, Pierre's unconventional design frightened some fans. The mascot's redesigned head was released on February 11. The Pelicans' former mascot when the organization was formerly the Hornets was Hugo the Hornet who was part of the organization from 2002-13. Hugo returned as the mascot for the Charlotte Hornets starting with the 2014-15 season.  The San Antonio Spurs are an American professional basketball team based in San Antonio , Texas . They are part of the Southwest Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). , The Spurs are one of four former American Basketball Association teams to remain intact in the NBA after the 1976 ABA–NBA merger and the only former ABA team to have won an NBA championship . The Spurs' five NBA championships are the fourth most in history behind only the Boston Celtics (17), Los Angeles Lakers (16), and Chicago Bulls (6). The Spurs currently rank first among active franchises for the highest winning percentage in NBA history. , In their 38 NBA seasons since 1976–1977, the Spurs have won 20 division titles. They have made the playoffs in 24 of the last 25 seasons (since 1989–1990) and have missed the playoffs four times since entering the NBA; they have not missed the playoffs in the 18 seasons since Tim Duncan was drafted by the Spurs in 1997. With their 50th win in the 2014–2015 season, the Spurs extended their record for most consecutive 50+ win seasons to 16 (the 1998/1999 season was shortened to 50 games because of a lockout and based on their win percentage of .740, would have easily surpassed 50 wins in an 82-game season, and thus extend the record by 2 more seasons). Thus, since the 1997/1998 season, the Spurs have actually had 18 consecutive seasons with a winning percentage of .610 or greater during the regular season which is also an NBA record. Only the team's current head coach, Gregg Popovich , who had been the team's general manager before replacing Bob Hill in 1996, has had a longer tenure with the Spurs. , , , The Spurs are the city's only team in any of the four major U.S. professional sports leagues and the only major-league team in the city's history to have lasted more than five years. Spurs players are active members of the San Antonio community, and many former Spurs are still active in San Antonio including David Robinson with the Carver Academy  and George Gervin with the George Gervin Youth Center.  , The Spurs set several NBA attendance records while playing at the Alamodome including the largest crowd ever for a NBA Finals game in 1999,  and the Spurs continue to sell out the smaller AT&T Center (formerly SBC Center) on a regular basis. , Since 2003, the team has been forced on an extended road trip for much of February since the AT&T Center hosts the San Antonio Stock Show & Rodeo . This is informally known as the "Rodeo Road Trip."  The Spurs have consistently posted winning road records during this period, including an NBA-record longest single road trip winning streak (eight games out of nine, achieved in 2003).  , When the Spurs have won the NBA title, the team's victory parades have been boat trips on the San Antonio River Walk .  , The San Antonio Spurs started out as the Dallas Chaparrals of the original version of the American Basketball Association (ABA). Coached by Player/Coach Cliff Hagan the Dallas Chaparrals were one of 11 teams to take the floor in the inaugural season of the upstart ABA. The Chaps second season was a bit of a disappointment, as the team finished in 4th place with a mediocre 41–37 record. In the playoffs the Chaparrals quickly fell to the New Orleans Buccaneers .  , The team suffered from poor attendance and general disinterest in Dallas. In fact, during the 1970–71 season , the name "Dallas" was dropped in favor of "Texas" and an attempt was made to make the team a regional one, playing games in Fort Worth, Texas , at the Tarrant County Convention Center , as well as Lubbock, Texas , at the Lubbock Municipal Coliseum , but this proved a failure and the team returned full-time to Dallas in time for the 1971–72 season , splitting their games at Moody Coliseum and Dallas Convention Center Arena .  , While the Chaparrals had been modestly successful on the court, they were sinking financially by their third season, largely because the ownership group refused to spend much money on the team. After missing the playoffs for the first time in their existence in the 1972–73 season , nearly all of the owners wanted out. A group of 36 San Antonio businessmen, led by Angelo Drossos , John Schaefer and Red McCombs worked out a "lend-lease" deal with the Dallas ownership group. Drossos and his group would lease the team for three years and move it to San Antonio, and agreed to return the team to Dallas if no purchase occurred by 1975. , After the deal was signed, the team was renamed the San Antonio Gunslingers.  However, before they even played a game the name was changed to Spurs. The team's primary colors were changed from the red, white, and blue of the Chaparrals to the now familiar black, silver and white motif of the Spurs. , In the first game at the HemisFair Arena the Spurs lost to the San Diego Conquistadors , despite attracting a noisy crowd of 6,000 fans. A smothering defense was the team's image, as they held opponents less than 100 points an ABA record 49 times. The early Spurs were led by ABA veteran James Silas , and the team would get stronger as the season went on as they twice took advantage of the Virginia Squires , acquiring Swen Nater , who would go on to win Rookie of the Year, in November, and "The Iceman" George Gervin in January. The ABA tried to halt the Gervin deal, claiming it was detrimental to the league, but a judge would rule in the Spurs' favor, and Gervin made his Spurs debut on February 7. The Spurs would go on to finish with a 45–39 record, good for 3rd place in the Western Division. , In the playoffs, the Spurs would battle the Indiana Pacers to the bitter end before falling in seven games. San Antonio embraced the Spurs with open arms; the Spurs drew 6,303 fans per game, surpassing the Chaparrals' entire total attendance in only 18 games. Drossos and McCombs knew a runaway hit when they saw it. After only one year, they exercised their option to tear up the lease agreement, buy the franchise outright and keep the team in San Antonio for good.  , The team quickly made themselves at home at HemisFair Arena, playing to increasingly large and raucous crowds. Despite a respectable 17–10 start during the 1974–75 season , Coach Tom Nissalke was fired as owners become tired of the Spurs' slow defensive style of games. He would be replaced by Bob Bass , who stated that the Spurs would have an entirely new playing style: "It is my belief that you cannot throw a set offense at another professional team for 48 minutes. You've got to let them play some schoolyard basketball." George Gervin and James Silas took that style to heart, as the Spurs became an exciting fast breaking team on the way to a solid 51–33 record, good enough for second place in the West. Gervin said, "Our whole theory was that you shoot 100 times, we'll shoot 107." However, in the playoffs the Spurs would fall to the Indiana Pacers in six games. , Even though playoff success would elude the team, the Spurs had suddenly found themselves among the top teams in the ABA. Moreover, their gaudy attendance figures made them very attractive to the NBA, despite the size of the market. Although San Antonio had over 650,000 people at the time (and has since grown to become the seventh-largest city in the United States), it has always been a medium-sized market because the surrounding suburban and rural areas aren't much larger than the city itself. In June 1976, the ABA-NBA merger took place, moving San Antonio's sole professional sports franchise into a new league. The Spurs, Denver Nuggets , Indiana Pacers and New York Nets moved to the NBA for the 1976–77 season. , The Spurs and the other three ABA teams agreed to pay the owners of two other strong ABA teams that folded instead of joining the NBA. John Y. Brown, Jr. , the owner of the Kentucky Colonels , received $3 million, which he used to purchase the NBA's Buffalo Braves and later the Boston Celtics , after selling star guard Louie Dampier to the Spurs. The owners of the Spirits of St. Louis received a portion of all television profits during their NBA tenure, which amounted to roughly 1/7 of the Spurs' television profit every year. This agreement placed particular financial pressure on the Spurs and the other three former ABA teams.  In 2014, the Spirits' owners reached agreement with the NBA to end the perpetual payments and take a lump sum of $500 million instead.  , Although there was some initial skepticism in league circles regarding the potential success and talent levels of the incoming ABA teams, the Spurs would prove worthy of NBA inclusion during the 1976–77 season with a record of 44–38, good for a tie for fourth place overall in the Eastern Conference. This was done in spite of significant handicaps the NBA imposed on the incoming ABA teams, limiting their draft picks and television revenues during their early time in the merged league. They gained a new rival in the form of the Houston Rockets , who had played in Texas for five years prior to the merger. , During the 1977–78 season , George Gervin and David Thompson of the Denver Nuggets battled all season for the NBA scoring title. On the final day of the season, Thompson took the lead by scoring 73 points in an afternoon game against the Detroit Pistons . That night Gervin knew that he needed 58 points against the Jazz in New Orleans. Gervin got off to a good start by scoring 20 points in the 1st quarter. In the 2nd, The Iceman was even better, setting a single period record with 33 points. Early on in the 3rd period Gervin scored his 58 points on the way to 63 capturing the scoring title. While Gervin was lighting up the scoreboard the Spurs were winning the Central Division with a 52–30 record. , However, in the playoffs the Spurs would be stunned in six games by the Washington Bullets despite an outstanding series from Gervin who averaged 33.2 ppg. The following season in the 1979 Conference Finals the Spurs led the series 3–1 but the Bullets came back to win the last three games and came from behind to win the 7th game 107–105 handing the Spurs a heartbreaking loss. The Spurs would have to wait another 20 years to make it to their first NBA finals. , The Spurs would go on to capture five division titles in their first seven years in the NBA and became a perennial playoff participant. However, in the playoffs, the Spurs would never find a break, losing to teams like the Washington Bullets, the Boston Celtics , the Houston Rockets , and the Los Angeles Lakers . , As the 1980s progressed, the Spurs would see their shares of highs and lows. For the first few seasons of the decade, the Spurs continued their success of the 1970s with records of 52–30 in 1980–81 , 48–34 in 1981–82 , and 53–29 in 1982–83 (it was during this period that the Spurs were moved to the Western Conference). , Despite their regular season success, the Spurs were unable to win any NBA championships, losing in the Western Conference playoffs to the Houston Rockets in the first round of the 1981 and the Los Angeles Lakers in four games 1982 and in six games in the 1983 Western Finals despite getting both wins at the Forum in the 1983 series. They lost every home game in both series in 1982 and 1983 vs the Lakers as Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and co. were too strong. The Spurs did not make the conference finals until 1995. , After the 1984–85 season , Gervin, who had been the Spurs' biggest star, was traded to the Chicago Bulls in what effectively signaled the end of the era that began when the Spurs first moved to San Antonio. , The next four seasons were a dark time in Spurs' history with the team having a combined record of 115–213 from 1985–86 until 1988–89 . The losing seasons and dwindling attendance often caused the Spurs to be mentioned as a potential candidate for relocation to another city. , The lone bright spot during this period was the Spurs being awarded the top pick in the 1987 NBA draft through NBA Draft Lottery. The Spurs used this selection on United States Naval Academy standout David Robinson . Although drafted in 1987, the Spurs would have to wait until the 1989–90 season to see Robinson actually play, due to a two-year commitment he had to serve with the United States Navy. , The Spurs seemingly bottomed out in 1988–89 with a record of 21–61, the worst in franchise history at the time. However, the 1989–90 season was notable for several reasons. It was the first season of full ownership for Red McCombs, who was an original investor in the team and helped solidify local ownership for the team. Additionally, the 1988–89 season featured the debut of Larry Brown as the Spurs head coach who moved to San Antonio after winning the NCAA National Championship with Kansas in 1988. , Although there was speculation that Robinson might choose not to sign with the Spurs and to become a free agent once his Navy commitment ended,   Robinson decided in the end to come to San Antonio for the 1989–90 season . , While it was thought his arrival would make the Spurs respectable again, no one expected what happened in his rookie season. Led by Robinson, 1989 draftee Sean Elliott from Arizona , and trade acquisition Terry Cummings from the Milwaukee Bucks, the Spurs achieved the biggest one-season turnaround in NBA history, finishing with a record of 56–26. They also jumped all the way to first place in the Midwest Division, their first division title in seven years. Robinson had one of the most successful rookie seasons for a center in NBA history, finishing the season as the unanimous Rookie of the Year while averaging 24.3 points and 12.0 rebounds. , The Spurs began the 1990s with great optimism. The team became a perennial playoff presence, although unable to advance further than the second round of the NBA Playoffs under Brown's tutelage. Late in the 1991–92 season , McCombs fired Brown and replaced him with Bob Bass for the remainder of the season. Without a healthy David Robinson, the Spurs were swept out of the first round of the playoffs by the Phoenix Suns. , McCombs made national headlines during the summer of 1992 with the hiring of former UNLV head coach Jerry Tarkanian . The Tarkanian experiment proved a flop, as the coach was fired 20 games into the 1992–93 season with the Spurs record at 9–11. After Rex Hughes filled the coaching shoes for one game, NBA veteran John Lucas was named head coach. It was Lucas' first NBA coaching assignment, although he had gained recognition in league circles for his success in helping NBA players rehab from drug abuse. The Lucas era started out successfully. His coaching propelled the team to a 39–22 finish over the rest of the regular season, and the team reached the Western Conference semi-finals , In 1993, local businessman Peter M. Holt and a group of 22 investors purchased the Spurs from Red McCombs for $75 million. In the 1993-94 season, the Spurs' first in the newly built Alamodome , Lucas led the team to a 55–27 record but the team suffered a loss in the first round of the playoffs, which led to the immediate firing of Lucas as head coach. Prior to the season the Spurs traded fan-favorite Elliott to the Detroit Pistons in return for rebounding star Dennis Rodman . , Lucas was replaced by former Pacers coach Bob Hill for the 1994–95 season . Elliott returned to the team after an uneventful season with the Pistons, and the team finished with the NBA's best record at 62–20, cracking the 60-win mark for the first time in franchise history. Robinson was named the league's Most Valuable Player. The Spurs reached the Western Conference Finals, but lost to the eventual NBA Champion Houston Rockets . Throughout the season, and particularly in the playoffs, there appeared to be friction developing between Rodman and several Spurs' teammates, most notably Robinson. Rodman was traded to the Chicago Bulls after the season, and helped the Bulls win three titles from 1996-1998. , The Spurs finished the 1995-96 season under Hill at 59–23 and lost in the Western Conference semi-finals. Few observers could have predicted how far the Spurs would fall during the 1996–97 season , especially with the signing of Dominique Wilkins . Robinson missed the first month of the season due to a back injury. He returned in December, but played only six games before a broken foot sidelined him for the rest of the season. Elliott also missed more than half the season due to injury. Without Robinson and Elliott, the Spurs were a rudderless team. The lone bright spot was Wilkins, leading the team in scoring with an average of 18.2 ppg. The Spurs ended the season with a 20–62 record, the worst in franchise history—and to date, the last time they have missed the playoffs. Hill only lasted 18 games as coach that season, eventually being fired and replaced by general manager Gregg Popovich , who had also served a stint under Brown as an assistant coach. Wilkins would play his lone season in 1996–97 for San Antonio, knowing his minutes and playing time would greatly diminish next season. , As disastrous as the 1996–97 season was for the Spurs, the offseason proved to be the opposite. With the third-worst record in the league, the Spurs won the NBA's draft lottery, which gave them the top pick in the 1997 draft . The Spurs used their pick to select Wake Forest product and consensus All-American Tim Duncan . , Gregg Popovich watched Tim Duncan play in summer league and immediately noted that, "If I try to coach this guy, the only thing I can do is screw him up," effectively saying that Duncan was very gifted, very intelligent, and had a keen knowledge of the game. , Duncan quickly emerged as a dominant force in the NBA during the 1997–98 season , averaging 21.1 points and 11.9 rebounds per game as a power forward. He was named First Team All-NBA while winning Rookie of the Year honors. The team ended up at 56–26, breaking their own record from 1989–90 for the biggest single-season improvement for wins, but once again lost to the Jazz in the Western Conference semifinals. While both Duncan and Robinson played low-post roles, the two seamlessly meshed on the court. , With a healthy Robinson and Duncan and the additions of playoff veterans such as Mario Elie and Jerome Kersey , the Spurs looked forward to the 1998–99 season . Prior to the beginning of training camps, however, the NBA owners, led by commissioner David Stern , locked out the players in order to force a new collective bargaining agreement with the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA). The season was delayed for over three months until resolution on a new labor agreement was reached in January 1999. , Playing a shortened 50-game season, the Spurs earned an NBA-best 37–13 record (.740 win percentage, and only season since Duncan was drafted the Spurs did not win at least 50 games in a season as of 2014). The team was just as dominant in the playoffs, rolling through the Western Conference with a record of 11–1. In the NBA Finals , they faced the New York Knicks , who had made history by becoming the first eighth seed to ever make the NBA Finals. The Spurs won the series and the franchise's first NBA Championship in Game 5 at the Knicks' home arena, Madison Square Garden . Duncan was named the NBA Finals MVP . The Spurs became the first former ABA team to reach and to win the NBA Finals. They also won the 1999 McDonald's Championship in the off-season and were the last champions of that tournament as it was disbanded right after. , Coming off their first NBA Championship, the Spurs were still among the best teams in the West and battling for first place in the Midwest Division during the 1999–2000 season . On March 14, the Spurs playoff spirits got a lift when Sean Elliott , who received a kidney transplant from his brother prior to the season, returned and played in the last 19 games. As the season wound down, Duncan suffered a knee injury and the Spurs finished in second place with a 53–29 record. Without Duncan, the Spurs were knocked out of the playoffs by the Phoenix Suns in four games. , The long-term viability of the Spurs franchise in San Antonio was, however, achieved during the 1999–2000 season, as Bexar County voters approved increases in car rental and hotel taxes which would allow for the construction of a new arena next to the Freeman Coliseum . The Spurs finished with 58–24 records for both the 2000–01 and 2001–02 seasons but found themselves suffering playoff ousters in both seasons from the eventual NBA Champion Los Angeles Lakers , getting swept from the 2001 Conference Finals and losing in five games during the second round in 2002. , Entering the 2002–03 season , the team knew it would be memorable for at least two reasons, as David Robinson announced that it would be his last in the NBA and the Spurs would begin play at their new arena, the SBC Center , named after telecommunications giant SBC , whose corporate headquarters were located in San Antonio (SBC became AT&T after its acquisition of its former parent company). To mark this occasion, the Spurs revamped their "Fiesta Colors" logo and reverted to the familiar silver and black motif (though, during the time of the Fiesta logo, the uniform remained silver and black). This version of the Spurs was very different from the team that had won the title a few years earlier. Second-year French star Tony Parker , drafted by the Spurs in the first round of the 2001 NBA Draft, was now the starting point guard for the Spurs. The squad featured a variety of newly acquired three-point shooters, including Stephen Jackson , Danny Ferry , Bruce Bowen , Steve Kerr , Steve Smith and Argentine product Manu Ginóbili , a 1999 second-round draft choice playing in his first NBA season. , The Spurs christened the SBC Center in style on November 1, 2002 by defeating the Toronto Raptors 91–72.  The Spurs would not get off to a flying start as they had just a 19–13 record heading into January. In January the Spurs began to gel and seemed prepped to make a run, when they embarked on their annual Rodeo Road Trip, a nine-game road trip from January 25 to February 16. However, it would be hardly a bump in the road for the charging Spurs, who won eight of the nine and began to climb their way to first place. The Spurs went on to erase their seven-game deficit and finished the season in a tie with the Dallas Mavericks for the best record in the NBA (60–22). Thanks to a tiebreaker, the Spurs won their third straight Division title as Tim Duncan claimed his second straight NBA MVP.  , Coming off their second NBA Championship, the retirement of David Robinson left a void in San Antonio's daunting defense, while playoff hero Steve Kerr and veteran forward Danny Ferry also retired. Meanwhile, backup point guard Speedy Claxton was hired away by the Warriors , and Stephen Jackson left for Atlanta . With several holes to fill in their rotation, the Spurs would make several key signings in the off-season. Rasho Nesterovic and Hedo Türkoğlu were brought in to replace Robinson and Jackson, respectively. What proved to be the most important off-season acquisition would be the signing of veteran Robert Horry . , The Spurs, playing with nine new players, struggled early as they missed the presence of Robinson while the new players struggled to fit in, as they held a 9–10 record on December 3. However, the Spurs would turn it around, as they ended December on a 13-game winning streak and quickly climbed back to the top of the NBA standings. They would battle all year for the top spot in the Western Conference, as they ended the season on another strong note winning their final 11 games. However, they would fall one game short of a division title and the best record in the West, posting a record of 57–25. In the second round of the playoffs, the Spurs found themselves in another showdown with the Los Angeles Lakers. The Spurs would win Games 1 and 2 at home, but drop the next two in the Los Angeles. In Game 5 back in San Antonio, Duncan seemingly delivered the Spurs a 73–72 win as he hit a dramatic shot with just 0.4 seconds remaining. However, the Lakers' Derek Fisher would launch a game-winner as time expired, giving the Lakers a stunning 74–73 win to take a 3–2 series lead.    The Spurs would eventually lose the series in six games. , , After their disappointing second round collapse, the Spurs looked to regain the NBA crown. With the acquisition of guard Brent Barry from Seattle , the Spurs would get off to a quick start, posting a 12–3 record in November. The Spurs would stay hot through December as they established a 25–6 record entering the New Year. With the later additions of center Nazr Mohammed from New York (acquired in a midseason trade of Malik Rose ), and veteran forward Glenn Robinson from free agency , alongside regulars Bruce Bowen , Robert Horry , Tony Parker , Manu Ginóbili , and Tim Duncan , the Spurs would be near the top in the Western Conference all season, battling the Phoenix Suns for the best record in the NBA. Just as it appeared the Spurs would cruise toward the playoffs their season suddenly hit a bump in the road when Tim Duncan suffered an ankle injury. The Spurs struggled the rest of the season, finishing just 59-23. However, by the time the playoffs rolled around, Duncan was ready to return. , In the postseason , The Spurs went through the West relatively easily, culminating with a 5-game victory in the Conference Finals over the Phoenix Suns . In the NBA Finals , the Spurs would face the defending champion Detroit Pistons . The first two games in San Antonio were both Spurs victories as Ginóbili led the way with 26 and 27 points, in blow out wins by the Spurs. However, as the series shifted to Detroit, the Spurs were the ones who were blown out, losing Games 3 and 4 by big margins as the Pistons evened the series. Faced with a third straight loss in Detroit, the Spurs would play tougher in Game 5, which would go into overtime. After going scoreless in the first half, Robert Horry hit a clutch three-point shot with nine seconds remaining to give the Spurs a dramatic 96–95 win.  The series moved back to San Antonio for game six, but the Spurs were unable to close out the series, setting up a deciding Game 7. In Game 7, Duncan had 25 points as the Spurs pulled away late to win their third NBA Title in seven years with an 81–74 win.  Duncan was named Finals MVP , becoming only the fourth player to win the MVP award three times (joining Magic Johnson , Shaquille O'Neal , and Michael Jordan ). , Coming off their third NBA Championship in seven years, there was a sense that the Spurs were the class of the NBA, and once again would be the team to beat in the NBA for the Championship.  For the 2005–06 season , the Spurs acquired the two-time All-Star Michael Finley and one-time All Star Nick Van Exel . Not surprisingly, the Spurs would come flying out of the gate, winning 16 of their first 19 games. Once again, the Spurs would get challenged within their own division by the Dallas Mavericks as they held the two best records in the Western Conference all season, battling for first place. In the end, the experience of the Spurs would be the difference as they won the Southwest Division again with a new franchise best record of 63–19.  The Spurs met the Mavericks in the second round of the playoffs, but it would be Dallas coming out on top 4-3, including a 119-111 overtime victory in Game 7. , The Spurs struggled during the first half of the 2006-07 season, which led to discussions of trading away veteran players to build for the future. The team remained intact, and the Spurs would win 13 games in a row during February and March, and were an NBA-best 25–6 in the final 31 games, as the Spurs were able to claim the 3-seed in the West. The Spurs cruised through the first round, while the #1-seeded Dallas Mavericks were upset. This set up a second-round series with the Phoenix Suns as the key series in the entire NBA Playoffs, as this series featured the teams with the two best records remaining in the NBA. , The Spurs went on to win 4–2 in the contentious and controversial series versus the Suns. The series featured a Robert Horry foul on Steve Nash toward the end of Game 4 which resulted in Horry being suspended for two games. Those who said the second-round series against the Suns was the true NBA Finals would be proven right, as the Spurs easily dispatched the Utah Jazz in five games to reach the NBA Finals . In the Finals, the Spurs swept the Cleveland Cavaliers and captured their fourth title in nine years. Tony Parker , who dominated in the Finals averaging 24.5 ppg on 57% shooting, was named Finals MVP and became the first European-born player to win the award .  , The 2007–2008 season saw the Spurs go 56–26 and finish 3rd in the Western Conference. The Spurs faced hurdles but would make it to the Western Conference Finals, but lose to the Lakers in five games. The next season would see the Spurs drop off in wins to 54-28 and lose to the Dallas Mavericks in the first round of the playoffs. , Two days before the 2009 NBA Draft , general manager R. C. Buford acted to address the team's age and health concerns  by acquiring 29-year-old swingman Richard Jefferson from the Milwaukee Bucks . The Spurs sent 38-year-old Bruce Bowen , 36-year-old Kurt Thomas , and 34-year-old Fabricio Oberto to the Bucks, who swapped Oberto to the Detroit Pistons for Amir Johnson . , The Spurs held three-second-round picks in the 2009 draft. Their selection of Pittsburgh Panthers forward DeJuan Blair with the #37 pick was described as a "steal" by analysts;   the Spurs later drafted two guards they had been targeting with the No. 37 pick,  taking Miami Hurricanes shooting guard Jack McClinton and point /shooting guard Nando de Colo from France with the No. 51 and No. 53 picks, respectively. On July 10, 2009, the Spurs signed Detroit Pistons power forward Antonio McDyess to a three-year deal worth approximately $15 million in guaranteed money.  , The Spurs struggled with injuries during the 2009–10 regular season, but managed another 50-win season, finishing at 50–32. The seventh-seeded Spurs would once again battle the Mavericks in the first round of the playoffs. After falling to the Mavericks in Game 1, the Spurs went on to avenge their 2009 defeat to Dallas by winning the series in six games. The Spurs however, were swept out of the playoffs in the following round by the Phoenix Suns. , During the 2010 NBA Draft , the Spurs management held the highest draft pick since the Tim Duncan draft a decade earlier. They drafted rookie James Anderson from Oklahoma State at #20.  However, Anderson was soon sitting out of the first half of the season due to injuries. In 2010–11, the Spurs finished 61–21 to be the #1 seed, but an injury to Ginóbili in the final regular season game took a toll on the team, and they were upset by the #8 seeded Memphis Grizzlies . , 2011 brought a change to the Spurs' philosophy that set the stage for the next successful run in the club's history. Out went the stream of last-legs, wizened veterans that the Spurs had relied on to fill out the rotation behind the Big Three. Minutes that had gone to the younger and more athletic talent like Danny Green , Gary Neal , and Tiago Splitter , to whom Popovich would teach The Spurs' Way—a fast pace, unselfish passing, and accountability on defense. The biggest personnel move of the Spurs' off-season had the club sending the beloved guard George Hill to his hometown Indiana Pacers for San Diego State 's Kawhi Leonard , a hyper-athletic forward selected #15 overall by the Pacers in the 2011 NBA Draft . The team also selected Texas Longhorns ' Cory Joseph as the #29 overall pick. , After the lockout that delayed the 2011-2012 season, the Spurs signed T.J. Ford , who would eventually retire in the middle of the season after playing only 14 games due to a stinger . Before the trade deadline, the Spurs decided to part ways with Richard Jefferson and sent him to the Golden State Warriors for Stephen Jackson , who had been a member of the 2003 championship team . Leonard then became the starting small forward. In the week following the trade deadline, the Spurs also signed forward Boris Diaw after his contract was bought out by the Charlotte Bobcats, and former Portland Trail Blazers guard Patrick Mills who played for the Xinjiang Flying Tigers in the CBA during the lockout. This gave the Spurs a deeper bench for their playoff run. , Despite the shortened 66-game NBA season due to the NBA lockout , the Spurs won 50 games and tied the Chicago Bulls for the best record in the league. They extended their streak of 50+ win seasons to 13 since the 1999–00 season , an NBA record. Popovich won his second Coach of the Year .  , The Spurs swept the first two rounds of the Playoffs . With those two sweeps, a 10-game win streak to end the season, and wins in Games 1 and 2 of the Western Conference Finals, the Spurs would win 20 straight games. However, the Oklahoma City Thunder would end up winning the next four games in the West Finals, to take the series 4-2. , During the 2012 off-season, the Spurs re-signed swingman Danny Green , who was a welcome surprise for them from the previous season. and Tim Duncan , both for three years. The Spurs would have a strong 2012-13 season , going 58-24 and earning the #2 seed in the West. , The Spurs clinched the playoffs for a 16th consecutive season, as well as extended the NBA record with 50+ games for 14 consecutive seasons. On April 16, the Spurs signed two-time scoring champion, and seven-time All-Star Tracy McGrady to help in the playoffs after waiving Stephen Jackson .  The Spurs finished the regular season second in the Western Conference behind the Oklahoma City Thunder with a record of 58–24, and swept the Los Angeles Lakers in the first round, 4–0. In the second round of the 2013 playoffs, the Spurs faced Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors. They beat the Warriors four games to two in.  In the conference finals, the Spurs swept the Memphis Grizzlies in, with Tony Parker having an 18-assist performance in Game 2 and a 37-point performance in Game 4.  The Spurs would meet the defending champion Miami Heat in the NBA Finals . , The Spurs and Heat would alternate wins the first six games in the series. In Game 6, the Spurs were on the verge of winning their fifth NBA title. San Antonio was up five points with 28 seconds to go in regulation. An unlikely and uncharacteristic series of mishaps would doom the Spurs down the stretch, including the benching of Duncan by Popovich at the end of regulation with the Spurs on defense. The Heat missed their field goal attempt, but the undersized Spurs could not grab the defensive rebound. The Heat rebounded the ball and Ray Allen then hit a 3-pointer to tie the game with five seconds left in regulation to send it to overtime, during which the Spurs were defeated 103–100. In Game 7, San Antonio jumped out to a lead early and kept the game close the entire way. Toward the end of the game, however, and despite a 24-point, 12 rebound effort, Duncan failed to convert on two attempts to tie the game: a missed layup and missed tip-in that allowed LeBron James to hit a jumper and increase the Heat's lead to 92–88. After a steal from Ginóbili, James hit two free throws after being fouled by Duncan, and when Ginóbili missed a subsequent 3-pointer, Dwyane Wade hit one out of two from the free throw line to put the game on ice, as the Heat would win their second straight championship.  , The Spurs returned with their core roster largely intact, while adding free agents Marco Belinelli and Jeff Ayres (formerly Jeff Pendergraph), while losing Gary Neal to the Milwaukee Bucks . The Spurs clinched the best record in the NBA with 62 wins, which included a franchise record 19 straight wins in February and March. In the first round of the playoffs, the eighth-seeded Dallas Mavericks surprised the Spurs by taking the series to 7 games, but the Spurs prevailed in convincing fashion in the deciding Game 7. In the second round, Tim Duncan surpassed Karl Malone for fifth place in NBA Playoffs all-time points scored while the Spurs cruised past the Portland Trail Blazers in 5 games. San Antonio played the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference Finals, which marked the third straight appearance in the Western Conference Finals for the Spurs, and defeated them in 6 games to advance to the Finals for a second straight year for a rematch with the Miami Heat . It was also the first time that they had advanced to the Finals in consecutive years. This made it the first time since 1998 NBA Finals that two teams faced off in the Finals in consecutive years. With a victory in the second game of the series, Duncan, Ginóbili, and Parker won more playoff games together than any other three players on the same team in NBA history. The Spurs would go on to win the 2014 NBA Championship, 4 games to 1. The Spurs blew out Miami in all of their wins, each of them by 15 or more points. Kawhi Leonard was named NBA Finals MVP for his big game performance and is the third youngest to win it, behind Magic Johnson and teammate Duncan. In the 2014 NBA draft , they selected Kyle Anderson out of UCLA as the 30th overall pick. , During the 2014 offseason, the Spurs made headlines when they announced that they had hired Becky Hammon as an assistant coach, effective with her retirement as a player at the end of the 2014 WNBA season .  Hammon became the first full-time female coach in any of the four major U.S. professional leagues .  The 2014-15 Spurs season was an up-and-down season, but finishing strong with a 55-27 regular season record and 6th seed in the West. They faced the Clippers in first round. The Spurs went up 3-2 heading into Game 6 at San Antonio. However, the Clippers would win that game and go on to win Game 7 at home. The San Antonio Spurs became the first defending champions since 2011-12 Dallas Mavericks to be eliminated in the First Round. , The rivalry between the San Antonio Spurs and the Los Angeles Lakers started in the late 1970s and peaked in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Since 1999, the teams have met in the NBA Playoffs 7 times, with the clubs combining to appear in seven straight NBA Finals from 1999–2005. Additionally, the teams won each NBA Title from 1999–2003 (the Spurs won in 1999 and 2003, while the Lakers won in 2000, 2001, and 2002). From 1999–2004, the rivalry was considered as the NBA's best,  as each time the clubs faced each other in the playoffs, the winner advanced to the NBA Finals. The rivalry fell off from 2005–07, with the Lakers missing the playoffs in 2005 and losing in the first round to the Phoenix Suns in 2006 and 2007, but intensified again in 2008 when they met in the Western Conference Finals. Both teams met once again for the 12th time in 2013 in the first round, with the Spurs winning in four games. , The rivalry between the San Antonio Spurs and the Dallas Mavericks features two teams with Dallas roots. The Spurs began their life in the ABA as the Dallas Chaparrals and did not move to San Antonio until 1973. On October 11, 1980, the Mavs made their NBA debut by defeating the Spurs 103–92. In the playoffs the Spurs defeated the Mavericks in 2001, 2003, 2010, and 2014; while the Mavericks defeated the Spurs in 2006 and 2009. The Spurs have won five championships and six conference titles, while the Mavericks have won one championship and two conference titles. The Spurs have won 18 division titles, while the Mavericks have won 3. The Mavericks have three 60-win seasons, while the Spurs have five. , The two teams met in the playoffs during the 2000–2001 season with the Spurs winning in five games. Little was made during this series, as the Spurs won their first NBA championship only two years before. The Mavericks, run by a trio of Steve Nash , Michael Finley , and Dirk Nowitzki , had just defeated the Utah Jazz , despite not having home court advantage, and were only starting to meld into a title contender. , The rivalry took on a new meaning in 2005 when, near the end of the regular season, Don Nelson resigned as Dallas' head coach, apparently dissatisfied with the state of the team, and handed the coaching reins to former Spur Avery Johnson , the point guard of the 1999 NBA champion Spurs team who hit the game-winning shot against the New York Knicks . Since Johnson was coached under Spurs Head Coach Gregg Popovich , he would be familiar with most, if not all, of Popovich's coaching style and philosophy. During the 2005 offseason, Michael Finley , waived by the Mavericks under the amnesty clause, joined the Spurs in search for an elusive title victory, that he finally was part of with the Spurs in 2007. Ironically, part of his salary was being paid for by the Mavericks during that season to allow for cap room. , The Mavericks were swept in the 2012–13 season by the Spurs for the first time since the 1998 season , Tim Duncan's rookie season. In their last match up of the season, San Antonio escaped with a 95–94 victory over Dallas when a Vince Carter 3-point attempt bounced off the rim at the buzzer. With that win, the Spurs clinched a playoff spot for a 16th straight season, currently the longest streak in the NBA. San Antonio also reached 50 wins for a 14th consecutive season, the longest streak in NBA history.  , In the 2013–14 season , the Spurs once again swept the Mavs in the regular season, giving them nine straight victories. In addition, an overtime loss to the Memphis Grizzlies on April 16, 2014 ensured that the Mavericks would face the Spurs once again in the 2014 NBA Playoffs , where the Mavs would be the eighth seed and San Antonio the first. In Game 1 in San Antonio, the game was relatively close. Dallas managed to reach an 81–71 lead in the fourth quarter, but the Spurs rallied back and took Game 1 at home, 90-85. However, the Mavs managed to force 22 turnovers in Game 2 to rout the Spurs 113–92, splitting the first two games before the series went to Dallas. In Game 3, Manu Ginobili managed to hit a shot that put the Spurs up 108–106 with 1.7 left, but a buzzer-beating three-pointer by Vince Carter gave the Mavs the victory, putting them up 2–1 in the series. The Spurs took Game 4 in Dallas 93–89 and later Game 5 at home 109–103, giving them a 3–2 lead. The Mavs avoided elimination in Game 6 at home by rallying in the fourth quarter, winning 111–113. The Spurs would then advance to the second round with a Game 7 blowout, winning 119–96. , Also known as the I-10 Rivalry since San Antonio and Houston both lie on the path of the Interstate 10 freeway. The rivalry between the San Antonio Spurs and the Houston Rockets began in 1976 when the Spurs were absorbed into the NBA from the American Basketball Association , along with the Denver Nuggets , the New York Nets , and the Indiana Pacers . The Rockets and Spurs competed for the division title, with the Rockets winning it first in 1977 and the Spurs in 1978 and 1979. In 1980, they met in the playoffs for the first time as the Rockets led by Moses Malone and Calvin Murphy beat the Spurs led by George Gervin and James Silas 2–1. The rivalry grew intense as both teams moved from the East to the West . They met again in 1981, this time in the second round. The Spurs had home-court advantage, and were heavily favored, winning the Midwest Division Title and the Rockets only 40–42. The Rockets and Spurs fought to the bitter end before the Rockets held on to win Game 7 capped by Murphy's 42 points. The Rockets would advance to the Finals in a losing cause to the Boston Celtics . The rivalry continued in 1995 when the defending champion Rockets led by Hakeem Olajuwon beat the top-seeded Spurs led by MVP David Robinson in the Western Conference Finals, despite only being the sixth seed, with Olajuwon, who had won the previous year's MVP, being widely regarded as having outplayed Robinson. In a regular season game early in the 2005 season , the Spurs were leading the Rockets very late in the 4th quarter by eight points. Houston's Tracy McGrady went on a personal 13–4 run in the final 35 seconds to miraculously steal the game away from San Antonio, including the game winning 3 pointer with one second remaining to the delight of the Toyota Center crowd. In 2014 , the Rockets who were now led by James Harden and Dwight Howard , swept the season series for the first time since Tim Duncan entered the league in 1997 , winning all four games, including one in San Antonio of which the Rockets led wire-to-wire. , The rivalry between the Spurs and the Phoenix Suns began in the 1990s when the Spurs were led by "The Admiral," David Robinson , and the Suns were propelled by a number of players including Dan Majerle , Kevin Johnson , and Tom Chambers . The rivalry continued into the next decade with Tim Duncan leading the Spurs and with the Suns headed by Steve Nash . In 2003, the Spurs beat the Suns 4–2 in the first round. In 2005, the Spurs beat the Suns 4–1 in the Conference Finals. In 2007, the Spurs beat the Suns 4–2 in a Conference Semi-finals series that was notable for putting the two best teams remaining in the NBA against each other. There was a controversial ruling in game 4 when Diaw and Stoudemire left the bench during an altercation and were suspended for game 5. In 2008, the Spurs beat the Suns 4–1 in the first round. Tim Duncan hit a three-pointer to force overtime and win the series. In 2010, the Suns swept the Spurs in four games in the playoffs, including a big time performance by Goran Dragic in game 3, against the team who originally drafted him, scoring 23 fourth quarter points, which amounted to 26 points in thirteen minutes. The rivalry has cooled off, with the Spurs winning most of the meetings, but that wasn't the case on February 21, 2014, where the Suns blew out the road-weary Spurs, who were ending the Rodeo Road Trip in Phoenix, 106–85. Markieff Morris of the Suns lead all scorers with 26 points. Danny Green lead the Spurs with a low 15 points. On April 11, 2014, the Spurs clinched the league-best record, and at the same time, handing the Suns a loss that would keep them out of the postseason, winning 112-104, with Danny Green setting a career high 33 points. In a pre-season game on October 16, 2014, Suns owner Robert Sarver apologized to the Phoenix crowd for the game, where the Spurs rested 5 people, including Popovich. Pop would only end his statement about the incident with, "The only thing that surprises me is that he didn't say it in a chicken suit." , Since becoming the San Antonio Spurs in 1973, the team colors have been black, silver and white. The distinctive logo of the word Spurs in Eurostile font, with the stylized spur substituting for the letter U, has been a part of the team's identity since their move to San Antonio.  The logo incorporated 'Fiesta colors' of pink, orange and teal, used from 1989 to 2002 (though the uniforms remained the same), and alignment from straight to arched beginning with the 2002–03 NBA season . , The Spurs have always worn black on the road and white at home, except during the 1973–76 ABA seasons and their first NBA season when the home uniform was always silver. Until the 1988–89 NBA season , the road uniform had "San Antonio" on the front while the home uniform featured the team nickname adopted from the Spurs logo; from 1973 to 1982, the road uniform lettering was black with silver trim. In addition, from 1977–81 a saddle -like striping was featured on the back of the home shorts. Since the 1989–90 NBA season the Spurs uniform has remained practically the same, with the road uniform now using the team nickname from their logo; a minor change included the addition of another black (road) and white (home) trim to the already silver-trimmed block numbers in the 2002–03 season. The Spurs wear black sneakers and socks on the road, and white sneakers and socks at home (except for select games with the silver alternates), a practice that began in the 2002–03 season. When the NBA moved to the Adidas Revolution 30 technology for the 2010–11 season, the Spurs changed to V-neck jerseys and eliminated striping on the shorts' beltline. , On September 19, 2012, the Spurs unveiled a silver alternate uniform. In breaking from the traditional practice of placing the team or city name in front, the Spurs' new uniform features only the stylized spur logo, with the black number trimmed in white and silver on the upper right. The Spurs primary logo is atop the player name and number on the back, while the Eurostile 'SA' initials (for San Antonio) are on the left leg of the shorts. Black, silver and white side stripes are also featured on the uniform. The uniforms are worn for select home games. A variation of this uniform, featuring military camouflage patterns instead of the usual silver, was used for two games in the 2013–14 season; a sleeved version was used the next season. , At times throughout the season, the Spurs wear a jersey that says "Los Spurs" on the front, in recognition of Latino fans both at home and across the US and Latin America. The Spurs were one of the first NBA teams to wear these branded jerseys. In 2014, the jerseys were sleeved. These events are called "Noches Latinas", first launched during the 2006–07 NBA season, part of an Hispanic marketing campaign known as "éne-bé-a".  Six teams in the NBA participate in these events. The Spurs have had the most players from Latin America and are one of only three NBA teams who have had at least five players on their rosters who originate from Latin America and Spain (if one includes Puerto Rico as part of Latin America, although it is a US territory), the others being the Memphis Grizzlies and the Portland Trail Blazers.  , List of the last five seasons completed by the Spurs.

The typical pattern is to allow the player to develop in leagues outside the USA. The player is free to negotiate contracts in other leagues and is not obligated to play in the NBA. Sometimes, a player's overseas contract may have an expensive buyout clause that would discourage the Spurs from seeking to bring him in. The Spurs have had past success in finding foreign talent; some examples of this success include the selections of second rounder Manu Ginóbili ( 1999 NBA Draft 57th pick) and first rounder Tony Parker ( 2001 NBA Draft 28th pick), who have both become All Stars . , Bold denotes still active with team.

They are members of the Pacific Division of the league's Western Conference . The Lakers play their home games at Staples Center , an arena shared with the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers , the Los Angeles Sparks of the Women's National Basketball Association , and the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League .  The Lakers are one of the most successful teams in the history of the NBA, and have won 16 NBA championships, their last being in 2010 . As of 2015, the Lakers are the most valuable franchise in the NBA according to Forbes , having an estimated value of $2.6 billion.  , The franchise began with the 1947 purchase of a disbanded team, the Detroit Gems of the National Basketball League (NBL). The new team began playing in Minneapolis , Minnesota , calling themselves the Minneapolis Lakers in honor of the state's nickname, "Land of 10,000 Lakes".  Initially a member of the NBL, the Lakers won the 1948 NBL championship before joining the rival Basketball Association of America and winning five of the next six BAA and NBA championships in Minneapolis after the NBA formed in 1949. The team was propelled by center George Mikan , who is described by the NBA's official website as the league's "first superstar".  After struggling financially in the late 1950s following Mikan's retirement, they relocated to Los Angeles before the 1960–61 season . , Led by Hall of Famers Elgin Baylor and Jerry West , Los Angeles made the NBA Finals six times in the 1960s, but lost each series to the Boston Celtics , beginning their long and storied rivalry . In 1968, the Lakers acquired four-time NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) Wilt Chamberlain to play center, and after losing in the Finals in 1969 and 1970, they won their sixth NBA title—and first in Los Angeles—in 1972 , led by new head coach Bill Sharman . After the retirement of West and Chamberlain, the team acquired another center, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , who had won multiple MVP awards, but was unable to make the Finals in the late 1970s. The 1980s Lakers were nicknamed " Showtime " due to their Magic Johnson -led fast break-offense, and won five championships in a nine-year span, including their first ever Finals championship against the Celtics in 1985 . This team featured Hall of Famers in Johnson, Abdul-Jabbar, and James Worthy , and a Hall of Fame coach, Pat Riley . After Abdul-Jabbar and Johnson's retirement, the team struggled in the early 1990s before acquiring Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant in 1996. Led by O'Neal, Bryant, and another Hall of Fame coach, Phil Jackson , Los Angeles won three consecutive titles between 2000 to 2002 , securing the franchise its second " three-peat ". After losing both the 2004 and 2008 NBA Finals , the Lakers won two more championships by defeating the Orlando Magic in 2009 and Boston in 2010. , The Lakers hold the record for NBA's longest winning streak , 33 straight games, set during the 1971–72 season.  Sixteen Hall of Famers have played for Los Angeles, while four have coached the team. Four Lakers—Abdul-Jabbar, Johnson, O'Neal, and Bryant—have won the NBA MVP Award for a total of eight awards.  , , , The Lakers' franchise began in 1947 when Ben Berger and Morris Chalfen of Minnesota purchased the recently disbanded Detroit Gems of the National Basketball League (NBL) for $15,000 from Gems owner Maury Winston.  Minneapolis sportswriter Sid Hartman played a key behind the scenes role in helping put together the deal and later the team.  Inspired by Minnesota's nickname, "Land of 10,000 Lakes", the team christened themselves the Lakers.   Hartman helped them hire John Kundla from College of St. Thomas , to be their first head coach, by meeting with him and selling him on the team.  , The Lakers had a solid roster which featured forward Jim Pollard , playmaker Herm Schaefer , and center George Mikan , who became the most dominant player in the NBL.  In their first season, they led the league with a 43–17 record.  , In 1948, the Lakers moved from the NBL to the Basketball Association of America (BAA), and Mikan's 28.3 point per game (ppg) scoring average set a BAA record. In the 1949 BAA Finals they won the championship, beating the Washington Capitols four games to two.  The following season, the team improved to 51–17, repeating as champions.  In the 1950–51 season, Mikan won his third straight scoring title at 28.4 ppg and the Lakers went 44–24 to win their second straight division title.  One of those games, a 19–18 loss against the Fort Wayne Pistons , became infamous as the lowest scoring game in NBA history.  In the playoffs, they defeated the Indianapolis Olympians in three games but lost to the Rochester Royals in the next round.  , During the 1951–52 season , the Lakers won 40 games, finishing second in their division.  They faced the New York Knicks in the NBA Finals , which they won in seven games.  In the 1952–53 season, Mikan led the NBA in rebounding, averaging 14.4 rebounds per game (rpg), and was named MVP of the 1953 NBA All-Star Game .  After a 48–22 regular season, the Lakers defeated the Fort Wayne Pistons in the Western playoffs to advance to the NBA Finals .  They then defeated the New York Knicks to win their second straight championship.  Though Lakers star George Mikan suffered from knee problems throughout the 1953–54 season, he was still able to average 18 ppg.  Clyde Lovellette , who was drafted in 1952 , helped the team win the Western Division.  The team won its third straight championship in the 1950s and fifth in six seasons when it defeated the Syracuse Nationals in seven games.  , Following Mikan's retirement in the 1954 off-season, the Lakers struggled but still managed to win 40 games. Although they defeated the Rochester Royals in the first round of the playoffs, they were defeated by the Fort Wayne Pistons in the semifinals.  Although they had losing records the next two seasons, they made the playoffs each year.  Mikan came back for the last half of the 1955–56 season , but struggled and retired for good after the season.  Led by Lovellette's 20.6 points and 13.5 rebounds, they advanced to the Conference Finals in 1956–57. The Lakers had one of the worst seasons in team history in 1957–58 when they won a league-low 19 games.  They had hired Mikan, who had been the team's general manager for the previous two seasons, as head coach to replace Kundla. Mikan was fired in January when the team was 9–30, and Kundla was rehired.   , The Lakers earned the top pick in the 1958 NBA Draft and used it to select Elgin Baylor . Baylor, who was named NBA Rookie of the Year and co-MVP of the 1959 NBA All-Star Game , averaged 24.9 ppg and 15.0 rpg helping the Lakers improve to second in their division despite a 33–39 record.  After upsetting the Hawks in six games in the division finals, they returned to the NBA Finals, but were swept by the Celtics, beginning their long rivalry.  , In their last year in Minneapolis, the Lakers went 25–50. On January 18, 1960, the team was coming off a loss and traveling to St. Louis when their plane crash-landed.  Snow storms had driven the pilot 150 miles off course when he was forced to land in a cornfield. No one was hurt.  Their record earned them the number two pick in the 1960 NBA Draft . The team selected Jerry West from West Virginia University .  During the 1960 off-season, the Lakers became the NBA's first West Coast team when owner Bob Short decided to move the team to Los Angeles.  Led by Baylor's 34.8 ppg and 19.8 rpg, Los Angeles won 11 more than the year before in West's first season.  On November 15 that season, Baylor set a new NBA scoring record when he scored 71 points in a victory against the New York Knicks while grabbing 25 rebounds.  In doing so, Baylor broke his own NBA record of 64 points. Despite a losing record, the Lakers made the playoffs .  They came within two points of the NBA Finals when they lost in game seven of their second round series against St. Louis.  , Led by Baylor and West at 38.3 and 30.8 ppg respectively,  the Lakers improved to 54–26 in 1961–62 , and made the finals . In a game five victory, Baylor grabbed 22 rebounds and set the still-standing NBA record for points in a finals game with 61,  despite fouling out of the game.  The Lakers, however, lost to the Celtics by three points in overtime of game seven.  Frank Selvy , after making two jumpers in the final 40 seconds to tie the game,   missed a potential game-winning 18 foot jump shot in regulation, a miss which he said in June 2010 still haunted him more than 40 years later.  , Los Angeles won 53 games in 1962–63 , behind Baylor's 34.0 ppg and West's 27.1 ppg  but lost in the NBA Finals in six games to the Celtics.  After falling to 42–38 and losing in the first round of the 1964 NBA Playoffs to the Hawks, the team won 49 games in 1964–65. The Lakers surged past the Baltimore Bullets in the division finals, behind West's record-setting 46.3 ppg in the series.  They lost again to Celtics in the Finals however, this time in five games.  , Los Angeles lost in the finals to Boston in seven games again in 1966, this time by two points.  Down by 16 entering the fourth quarter, and 10 with a minute and a half to go, the Lakers mounted a furious rally in the closing moments which fell just short.  After dropping to 36 wins and losing in the first round of the 1967 NBA Playoffs , they lost in the finals to the Celtics again in 1968 .  Los Angeles moved to a brand-new arena, The Forum , in 1967, after playing seven seasons at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena . , On July 9, 1968, the team acquired Wilt Chamberlain from the Philadelphia 76ers for Darrell Imhoff, Archie Clark , and Jerry Chambers .  In his first season as a Laker, Chamberlain set a team record by averaging a league-leading 21.1 rpg.  West, Baylor, and Chamberlain each averaged over 20 points, and Los Angeles won their division.  The Lakers and Celtics again met in the finals , and Los Angeles had home court advantage against Boston for the first time in their rivalry. They won the first game behind Jerry West's 53 points,  and had a 3–2 lead after five.  Boston won the series in seven games however,  and earned their 11th NBA Championship in 13 seasons.  West was named the first-ever Finals MVP ; this remains the only time that a member of the losing team has won the award.  In 1970 , West won his first scoring title at 31.2 ppg, the team returned to the finals , and for the first time in 16 years, they did not have to face the Celtics; instead playing the New York Knicks, who defeated them 4–3.   The next season the Lakers were defeated by the Milwaukee Bucks , led by future Laker Lew Alcindor (now known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) in the Western Conference Finals.  , The 1971–72 season brought several changes. Owner Jack Kent Cooke brought in Bill Sharman as head coach,  and Elgin Baylor announced his retirement early in the season after realizing that his legs were not healthy enough.  Sharman increased the team's discipline.  He introduced the concept of the shootaround , where players would arrive at the arena early in the morning before a game to practice shots.  They won 14 straight games in November and all 16 games played in December.  They won three straight to open the year of 1972 but on January 9, the Milwaukee Bucks ended their winning streak by defeating the Lakers, 120–104.  By winning 33 straight games, Los Angeles set a record for longest winning streak of any team in American professional sports.  The Lakers won 69 games that season, which stood as the NBA record for 24 years until the Chicago Bulls won 72 games in 1995–96.  Chamberlain averaged a career-low 14.8 points but led the league in rebounding at 19.2 a game.  West's 9.7 assists per game (apg) led the league, he also averaged more than 25 points, and was named MVP of the 1972 NBA All-Star Game .  The team failed to score 100 points just once all year,  and at the end of the season, Bill Sharman was named Coach of the Year .  The Lakers went on to reach the finals against the New York Knicks where they would avenge their 1970 finals loss by defeating them 4 games to 1. Chamberlain tallied 24 points and 29 rebounds in game five and won the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award .   , The Lakers won 60 games in the 1972–73 NBA season , and took another Pacific Division title.  Wilt Chamberlain, playing in his final season, again led the league in rebounding and set the still standing NBA record for field-goal percentage at 72.7%.  The team defeated the Chicago Bulls in seven games in the conference semifinals, then the Golden State Warriors in five in the Western Division Finals.  They played the New York Knicks in the 1973 NBA Finals . Los Angeles took the first game by three points, but New York won the series in five games.  , During the 1973–74 season , the team was hampered by the loss of West, who played only 31 games before his legs gave out.  Goodrich, averaging 25.3 points, helped the team to a late-season surge.  Trailing the Golden State Warriors by three games with seven left to play, the Lakers rallied to finish 47–35 and win the Pacific Division.  They made the playoffs but managed just one win against Milwaukee in the conference semifinals. Following the season, West retired due to contract disagreements with Cooke, and filed a suit for unpaid back wages.  , After missing the playoffs in the 1974–75 season , the Lakers acquired Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , who had won three league MVP's by that time.  Abdul-Jabbar wanted out of Milwaukee, demanding a trade to either New York or Los Angeles.  He was traded for Elmore Smith , Brian Winters , Junior Bridgeman , and Dave Meyers . Abdul-Jabbar had his fourth MVP season in 1975–76 , leading the league in rebounding, blocked shots, and minutes played.  The Los Angeles struggled in January, going 3–10, and finished out of the playoffs at 40–42.  , West and Cooke settled their differences—and the former Laker's lawsuit—and Cooke hired him to replace Sharman as the team's coach.  West became upset, however, when Cooke refused to spend the money necessary to acquire forward Julius Erving , who the Nets were selling.  Behind another MVP season from Abdul-Jabbar, Los Angeles won the Pacific Division, finishing the 1976–77 season a league-best 53–29.  They defeated the Warriors in a seven-game series to open the postseason before being swept by Portland in the Western Conference Finals.  During the offseason, Los Angeles picked up Jamaal Wilkes from Golden State and signed first-round draft pick Norm Nixon . In the first two minutes of the first game of the 1977–78 season, Abdul-Jabbar punched Bucks center Kent Benson for an overly aggressive elbow and broke his hand.  Two months later, a healthy Abdul-Jabbar got into an altercation with Houston Rockets center Kevin Kunnert after a rebound. The team's starting power forward, Kermit Washington , who was averaging 11.5 points and 11.2 rebounds,  entered the fight, and when Rudy Tomjanovich ran in from the bench to break up the action, Washington punched him in the face.  Tomjanovich nearly died from the punch, suffering a fractured skull and other facial injuries which prematurely ended his playing career.  Washington, who stated that he assumed Tomjanovich was a combatant, was suspended for two months by the NBA, and released by the Lakers.  The team won 45 games despite being down a starter in Washington and not having Abdul-Jabbar for nearly two months, but lost in the first round of the playoffs to Seattle.  During the 1978–79 season, the team posted a 47–35 record but lost to the SuperSonics in the semifinal round of the playoffs.  , In the 1979 NBA Draft , Los Angeles selected 6-foot, 9-inch point guard Magic Johnson from Michigan State with the first overall pick.  It took Johnson's teammates time to acclimate themselves to his passing ability, as his "no-look" passes often caught them unaware. Once they adjusted, his passing became a key part of Los Angeles' offense.  The Lakers won 60 games in Johnson's rookie year, and defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in six games in the 1980 NBA Finals . Johnson won the series Finals MVP award, after starting at center for the injured Abdul-Jabbar in game six, and tallying 42 points, 15 rebounds, and seven assists.  The team fell off in the 1980–81 season, though, as the Lakers lost Johnson for most of the season to a knee injury.  The team turned in a 54–28 record and finished second behind the Phoenix Suns in the Pacific Division.  The Rockets , led by Moses Malone , defeated Los Angeles in the first round of the playoffs.  , Early in the 1981–82 season, Johnson complained to the media about head coach Paul Westhead and demanded a trade.  Westhead was fired shortly after Johnson's criticisms, and although Lakers' owner Jerry Buss stated that Johnson's comments did not factor into the decision, Johnson was vilified by the national media and booed both on the road and at home.    Buss promoted assistant coach Pat Riley to "co-head coach" with Jerry West (although West considered himself Riley's assistant) on November 19 and the team won 17 of its next 20 games.    Nicknamed " Showtime " due to the team's new Johnson-led fast break-offense, the Lakers won the Pacific Division title and swept both the Suns and Spurs .  Los Angeles stretched its postseason winning streak to nine games by taking the first contest of the NBA Finals from the 76ers .   The team won the Finals 4–2 to finish a 12–2 playoff run.  On draft night in 1982 , the Lakers had the first overall pick and selected James Worthy from North Carolina .  The Lakers won the Pacific Division at 58–24, but Worthy suffered a leg injury in the last week of the season and missed the rest of the season however.  Nevertheless, they advanced to play Philadelphia in the 1983 NBA Finals by defeating Portland and San Antonio in the first two rounds.  The Sixers, however, won the series and the championship in four games.  After the season West replaced Sharman as the team's GM.  , In the 1983–84 season Los Angeles went 54–28, and played Boston in the Finals for the first time since 1969 .  They won two of the first three games. Kevin McHale 's hard clothesline foul of Lakers forward Kurt Rambis on a fast break is credited as a turning point of the series.  Boston won three of the next four to win the title and send Los Angeles's record to 0–8 in Finals series against the Celtics.  , Using the past year's Finals defeat as motivation, the team won the Pacific Division for the fourth straight year and lost just twice in the Western Conference playoffs. In the NBA Finals, the Celtics were again the Lakers' final hurdle. Los Angeles lost game one of the NBA Finals by a score of 148–114, in what is remembered as the "Memorial Day Massacre".  The Lakers, behind 38-year old Finals MVP Abdul-Jabbar, recovered to defeat the Celtics in six games.  The team won the title in the Boston Garden , becoming the only visiting team to ever win an NBA championship there.  , In the 1985–86 season, the Lakers started 24–3. They won 62 games, and their fifth straight division title.  The Rockets , however, defeated the Lakers in five games in the Western Conference Finals. Houston won the series when Ralph Sampson hit a 20-foot jumper as time expired in game five at The Forum.  Prior to the 1986–87 season , the Lakers moved A. C. Green into the starting lineup, and acquired Mychal Thompson from the Spurs.  Johnson won his first career MVP Award while leading the Lakers to a 65–17 record,  and Michael Cooper was named NBA Defensive Player of the Year.  Before the season Riley had made the decision to shift the focus of the offense to Johnson over the 40-year old Abdul-Jabbar.  , The Lakers advanced to the NBA Finals by sweeping the Nuggets , defeating the Warriors in five games, and sweeping the SuperSonics in the Western Conference Finals.  The Lakers defeated Boston in the first two games of the Finals, and the teams split the next four games, giving Los Angeles their second championship in three seasons.  The series was highlighted by Johnson's running "baby hook" shot to win game four at Boston Garden with two seconds remaining.  Johnson was named the NBA Finals MVP, in addition to regular-season MVP.  At the Lakers' championship celebration in Los Angeles, coach Riley brashly declared that Los Angeles would repeat as NBA champions,  which no team had done since the 1968–69 Boston Celtics . During the 1987–88 season , the Lakers took their seventh consecutive Pacific Division title, and met the Detroit Pistons in the 1988 NBA Finals . Los Angeles took the series in seven games, and James Worthy's game seven triple double earned him a Finals MVP award.  In the 1988–89 season , Los Angeles won 57 games. They swept the playoffs up till the NBA Finals , and faced the Detroit Pistons again.  The Lakers, hampered by injuries to Byron Scott and Johnson, were swept by Detroit .  , On June 28, 1989, after 20 professional seasons, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar announced his retirement. A year later, 1987 Defensive Player of the Year winner Michael Cooper decided to play in Europe and was waived at his request.  The Lakers went 63–19 in the 1989–90 season, but lost 4–1 in the second round of the playoffs.  Riley left the team after the season citing burnout ,  and was replaced by Mike Dunleavy .  Riley's departure received a mixed reaction from the players. They respected his contributions, but some, such as Worthy and Scott, had grown tired of his intense practices and felt he tried to take too much credit for the team's successes.  , The team made another Finals appearance in 1991 , but lost in five games to a Chicago Bulls team led by Michael Jordan .  On November 7, 1991, Magic Johnson announced he had tested positive for HIV and would retire immediately.  In their first season without Johnson, the team won 43 games,  but became the first eighth seed to win the opening two games on the road against a number one seed when they took a 2–0 lead versus Phoenix .  They lost the next two games at home however, then game five in Phoenix in overtime.  Randy Pfund was let go as head coach in March 1994 and eventually replaced by Johnson, who coached the club with former teammate Michael Cooper as his lead assistant.  Johnson decided not to take the job permanently due to what he felt was a lack of commitment from certain players, and Los Angeles ended the season with a 10-game losing streak to finish 33–49 and out of the playoffs.   , The next two seasons, Los Angeles made the playoffs, but was eliminated in the second and first rounds respectively.   The team was coached by Del Harris and led by young guards Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones .  Johnson came out of retirement in the 1995–96 season to lead the then 24–18 Lakers to a 29–11 finish.  After some run-ins with Van Exel, displeasure with Harris's strategies, and a first round loss to the Rockets , Johnson decided to retire for the final time after the season.  , During the 1996 off-season, the Lakers acquired 17-year-old Kobe Bryant from the Charlotte Hornets for Vlade Divac ; Bryant was drafted 13th overall out of Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, Pennsylvania in that year's draft , by Charlotte. Los Angeles also signed free-agent Shaquille O'Neal .  Trading for Bryant was West's idea, and he was influential in the team's signing of the all-star center.  "Jerry West is the reason I came to the Lakers," O'Neal later said.  They used their 24th pick in the draft to select Derek Fisher .  During the season, the team traded Cedric Ceballos to Phoenix for Robert Horry .  O'Neal led the team to a 56–26 record, their best effort since 1990–91, despite missing 31 games due to a knee injury.  O'Neal averaged 26.2 ppg and 12.5 rpg and finished third in the league in blocked shots (2.88 bpg) in 51 games.   The Lakers defeated the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round of the 1997 NBA Playoffs . O'Neal scored 46 points in Game 1 against the Trail Blazers, marking the highest single-game playoff scoring output by a Laker since Jerry West scored 53 against the Celtics in 1969.  In the next round, the Lakers lost four games to one to the Utah Jazz .  , In the 1997–98 season , O'Neal and the Lakers had the best start in franchise history, 11–0.  O'Neal missed 20 games due to an abdominal injury.  Los Angeles battled Seattle for the Pacific Division title most of the season. In the final two months, the Lakers won 22 of their final 25 games,  finishing 61–21, and second to Seattle in the standings.  The Lakers defeated Portland three games to one in the first-round. The following round, they faced Seattle. Although the Sonics won the first game, the Lakers responded with four straight wins, taking the series,  but were swept by the Jazz in the next round.  , During the 1998–99 season , All-Star guard Eddie Jones and center Elden Campbell were traded to the Charlotte Hornets.  The team also acquired J. R. Reid , B. J. Armstrong , and Glen Rice .  Harris was fired in February after a three-game losing streak and replaced on an interim basis by former Laker Kurt Rambis.  The team finished 31–19 in the shortened season, which was fourth in the Western Conference.  Los Angeles defeated Houston in the first round of the playoffs, but were swept by San Antonio in the next round with game 4 being the last game ever played at the Great Western Forum .  , Before the 1999–2000 season , West was prepared to hire Rambis as the team's full-time coach before an outcry from fans and members of the organization caused him to seek out a bigger name.  Los Angeles hired former Chicago Bulls coach Phil Jackson , who had coached that team to six championships, and gave him a lucrative $6 million a year contract.  He brought along assistant Tex Winter and they installed Winter's version of the triangle offense .  They signed veterans Brian Shaw , John Salley , Ron Harper , and A. C. Green, who was a Laker during the "Showtime" era.  The team also moved to a new arena, the Staples Center.  After the season, starters Rice and Green left the team,  and Los Angeles signed Horace Grant .  , Led by league MVP O'Neal, the Lakers won 31 of their first 36 games.  Los Angeles finished 67–15, their highest total since they won 65 in the 1986–87 season.  They eliminated the Sacramento Kings and Phoenix in the first two rounds of the playoffs.  After the Lakers took a three games to one lead in the Western Conference Finals, the Trail Blazers won the next two games to force a game seven.  The Lakers were down by 15 points in the fourth quarter but went on a 19–4 run to tie the game.  They won 89–84 to advance to the NBA Finals.  They defeated Reggie Miller and the Indiana Pacers 4–2 in the 2000 NBA Finals to win their first title since 1988.  West retired from his spot in the team's front office after the season after a power struggle between him and Jackson over control of the team's operations.  , The following season, Los Angeles won 11 fewer regular season games,  but swept the first three rounds of the playoffs, defeating the Portland, Sacramento, and San Antonio.  They met Allen Iverson and the Philadelphia 76ers in the 2001 NBA Finals . Although the Sixers took game one in overtime,  the Lakers won the next four games to win their second straight title. Their 15–1 postseason record is the best in NBA history.  , Los Angeles won 58 games in 2001–02 . In the playoffs, they swept the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round, and defeated the Spurs 4–1 in the second.  They faced the rival Kings in the Western Conference Finals. The series has long been cited as one of the greatest playoff matchups in NBA history. The series extended to all seven games, and ended in a Lakers victory.  In game 1, Bryant scored 30 points as the Lakers won, 106-99. The series would then shift in Sacramento's favor, with the Kings winning the next two games. Facing a 3-1 deficit in game 4, the Lakers had the ball with under 20 seconds to play. After misses by both Bryant and O'Neal, Kings center Vlade Divac tapped the ball away from the rim in an attempt to wind down the clock. It went straight into Robert Horry 's hands, who drained a game-winning three with under 3 seconds to play. After the Kings won game 5 on a buzzer beater by Mike Bibby , the Lakers were faced with a must-win game 6. In one of the most controversial playoff games in league history,  the Lakers won by 4 points. A multitude of questionable calls were made in the last 2 minutes of the game. At one point, Bibby was elbowed in the face by Bryant and was called for a foul. The Lakers won game 7 in overtime, with the Kings missing numerous potentially game-saving shots and free throws. The Lakers then achieved a three-peat by sweeping Jason Kidd and the New Jersey Nets in the NBA Finals .  O'Neal won each of the Finals series' MVP awards, making him the only player besides Michael Jordan to win three consecutive Finals MVPs.  , The Lakers started the 2002–03 season 11–19.  They went 39–13 the rest of the way to finish 50–32.  They defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round of the 2003 NBA Playoffs , but were eliminated by San Antonio in six games in the second.  During the 2003–04 season, the team was the subject of intense media coverage generated by the teaming of four stars and the sexual-assault case involving Kobe Bryant .   Before the season, Los Angeles signed two-time MVP Karl Malone formerly of the Jazz, and former Seattle Defensive Player of the Year Gary Payton .  Three of the "big four", however, struggled with injuries: O'Neal suffered from a strained calf, Malone an injured knee, and Bryant an injured shoulder.   The Lakers started 18–3 and finished 56–26. They won the Pacific Division title, and entered the playoffs as the number two seed. They defeated the Rockets, Spurs, and Timberwolves in the first three rounds of the 2004 NBA Playoffs , before succumbing to Detroit in five games in the 2004 NBA Finals .  During the 2004 offseason, the team entered a rebuilding phase when O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat for Lamar Odom , Brian Grant , Caron Butler , and a first-round draft pick.  Bryant and O'Neal had clashed in the past ,  and the media credited their feud as one of the motivating factors for the trade.  Jackson did not return as head coach, and wrote a book about the team's 2003–04 season, in which he heavily criticized Bryant and called him "uncoachable".    The Lakers front office said that the book contained "several inaccuracies".  , The Lakers traded Rick Fox and Gary Payton to Boston, for Chris Mihm , Marcus Banks , and Chucky Atkins before the 2004–05 season .  Derek Fisher, frustrated with losing playing time, opted out of his contract and signed with the Warriors.  The team hired Rudy Tomjanovich to replace Jackson.  After sitting out the first half of the 2004–05 season, Malone announced his retirement on February 13, 2005.  Tomjanovich coached the team to a 22–19 record before resigning due to health problems.  Assistant Frank Hamblen was named interim head coach to replace Tomjanovich for the remainder of the season.  Bryant (ankle) and Odom (shoulder) suffered injuries, and the Lakers finished 34–48, missing the playoffs for the fifth time in franchise history.  , With the tenth overall pick in the draft , Los Angeles selected Andrew Bynum , a center from St. Joseph High School in Metuchen, New Jersey .  The team also traded Caron Butler and Chucky Atkins to the Washington Wizards for Kwame Brown and Laron Profit .  Jackson returned to coach the team after Rudy Tomjanovich resigned midway through the previous season.  On January 22, 2006, Bryant scored 81 points against the Toronto Raptors , the second-highest total in NBA history.  Ending the season 45–37, the team made the playoffs after a one season absence.  After taking a three games to one lead in the first round, the Suns came back to take the series in seven games.  In the following season , they won 26 of their first 39 games,  but lost 27 of their last 43—including seven in a row at one point—to finish 42–40.  They were eliminated in the first round by the Suns again, this time 4–1.  Frustrated by the team's inability to advance in the playoffs, Bryant demanded to be traded in the offseason.  Buss initially agreed to seek a trade,  but also worked to try to change Bryant's mind.  , After re-acquiring Derek Fisher , Los Angeles started the 2007–08 season with a 25–11 record, before Andrew Bynum , their center who was leading the league in field-goal percentage, went out for the year due to a knee injury in mid-January.  They acquired power forward Pau Gasol from the Memphis Grizzlies in a trade in early February and went 22–5 to finish the season.  The Lakers' 57–25 record earned them the first seed in the Western Conference .  Bryant was awarded the league's MVP award, becoming the first Laker to win the award since O'Neal in 2000.   In the playoffs , they defeated the Nuggets in four games, the Jazz in six, and the defending champion Spurs in five, but lost to the Celtics in six games in the NBA Finals .  , In the 2008–09 season , the Lakers finished 65–17; the best record in the Western Conference.  They defeated the Jazz in five games, the Rockets in seven and the Nuggets in six, to win the Western Conference title. They then won their fifteenth NBA championship by defeating the Orlando Magic in five games in the NBA finals .  Bryant was named the NBA Finals MVP for the first time in his career.  , The Lakers, who had added Ron Artest (now Metta World Peace  ) in place of Trevor Ariza in their starting lineup, finished the 2009–10 season with the best record in the Western Conference for the third straight time. On January 13, 2010, the Lakers became the first team in NBA history to win 3,000 regular season games by defeating the Dallas Mavericks 100–95.  They defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder , the Utah Jazz , and the Phoenix Suns in the Western Conference playoffs . In the finals , the Lakers played the Boston Celtics for the 12th time. They rallied back from a 3–2 disadvantage in the series and erased a 13-point deficit in the fourth quarter of the seventh game to defeat the Celtics. This series win gave them their 16th NBA title overall and 11th since they moved to Los Angeles.  Bryant was named Finals MVP for the second year in a row, despite a 6–24 shooting performance in game seven.  , After much speculation, head coach Phil Jackson returned for the 2010–11 season .  In the playoffs , the Lakers defeated the New Orleans Hornets in the first round.  But their opportunity for a three-peat was denied by the Dallas Mavericks in a four-game sweep of the second round. After the season, it was announced that Jackson will not be returning to coach the Lakers.  , After Jackson's retirement, former Cleveland Cavaliers head coach Mike Brown was hired as head coach on May 25, 2011.  Before the start of the shortened 2011–12 season, the Lakers traded Lamar Odom to the Dallas Mavericks after Odom requested to be traded.  On the trade deadline long time Laker Derek Fisher along with a first round draft pick were traded to the Houston Rockets for Jordan Hill .  With a 41–25 regular season record the Lakers entered the playoffs as the third seed, the team defeated the Denver Nuggets in the first round in seven games but were eliminated by the Oklahoma City Thunder in the second round in five games.   , On July 4, 2012, Steve Nash of the Phoenix Suns agreed to a sign-and-trade deal that would send him to the Lakers in exchange for the Lakers' 2013 and 2015 first round draft picks, 2013 and 2014 second round draft picks, and $3 million. The trade was made official on July 11, 2012, the first day the trade moratorium was lifted.  On August 10, 2012, in a four-team trade the Lakers traded Andrew Bynum and acquired Dwight Howard .  On November 9, 2012, Mike Brown was relieved of coaching duties after a 1–4 start to the 2012–13 season.  Assistant Coach Bernie Bickerstaff took over as interim head coach, leading the Lakers to a 5–5 record. On November 12, 2012, the Lakers hired Mike D'Antoni as head coach.  On February 18, 2013, Lakers owner Jerry Buss died from cancer at age 80.  On the court, D'Antoni coached the Lakers to a 40–32 record the rest of the way to finish 45–37, their worst record since 2007 . The Lakers clinched a playoff berth on the final game of the season and finished seventh in the Western Conference after beating the Houston Rockets on April 16, 2013.   The Lakers battled injuries all season, the most prominent of which is the Achilles tendon rupture to Kobe Bryant that ended his season after 78 games. The absence of Bryant was sorely felt as the Lakers were swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the 2013 NBA Playoffs .  Nevertheless, Bryant passed Lakers legend Wilt Chamberlain to become the fourth all-time leading scorer in NBA history on March 30, 2013 against the Sacramento Kings.  , On March 25, 2014, the Lakers scored 51 points in the third quarter against the New York Knicks, the most points scored in a quarter in the history of the franchise.  The Lakers went on to miss the NBA playoffs for the first time since 2005, for just the second time in the last two decades and for just the sixth time in franchise history. On April 30, 2014, Mike D'Antoni resigned from his position as head coach after a 27-55 season.  , After spending the majority of the off-season without a head coach, the Lakers named former player Byron Scott as the new head coach, who previously served as the head coach of the New Jersey Nets (whom he coached against the Lakers in the 2002 NBA Finals ), New Orleans Hornets and the Cleveland Cavaliers . Scott spent the 2013–14 season as a Lakers television analyst on Time Warner Cable SportsNet .  After the season, he was the frontrunner to become the new Lakers head coach. Scott interviewed three times for the position, which had become vacant after Mike D'Antoni 's resignation.  On July 28, 2014, he signed a multi-year contract to coach the Lakers.  , During the first game of the 2014–2015 season, the seventh overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft , Julius Randle went down with a broken leg which ended his rookie season. The Lakers began their season losing 10 of their first 16 games. After playing only 35 games, Kobe Bryant tore a rotator cuff in his shoulder ending his season. Nick Young was also forced to end his season with a fractured kneecap, leaving the team with a record of 14–41.  With 27 games left in the regular season, Byron Scott gave rookie Jordan Clarkson more playing time. On March 30, Clarkson played his best game with 26 points, 11 assists, 6 rebounds, and 3 steals. The rookie impressed many coaches and players around the league winning Western Conference Rookie of the Month for March. Jordan Clarkson, the 46th overall pick in the 2014 Draft, finished his rookie season with game stats of 11.9 ppg, 3.2 rpg, 3.5 apg, and shooting 44.8% from the field.  The Lakers' season ended with a record of 21–61, the 4th worst record in the league and the worst record in franchise history. , The rivalry between the Boston Celtics and the Lakers involves the two most storied basketball franchises in National Basketball Association (NBA) history. It has been called the best rivalry in the NBA.  The two teams have met a record twelve times in the NBA Finals , starting with their first Finals meeting in 1959 . They would go on to dominate the league in the 1960s and the 1980s, facing each other six times in the 60s and three times in the 80s. , The rivalry had been less intense since the retirements of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird in the early 1990s, but in 2008 it was renewed as the Celtics and Lakers met in the Finals for the first time since 1987, with the Celtics winning the series 4–2. They faced off once again in the 2010 NBA Finals which the Lakers won in 7 games. Since 1960, the Lakers are 4-2 against their fiercest rival in the Finals. , The two teams have won the two highest numbers of championships, the Celtics 17, the Lakers 16; together, the 33 championships account for almost half of the 67 championships in NBA history. , The rivalry between the Lakers and the Los Angeles Clippers is unique because they are the only two NBA teams to share an arena, the Staples Center . It is also one of only two intra-city rivalries in the NBA, the other being the new crosstown rivalry between the New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets . , Los Angeles fans have historically favored the Lakers.   Some contend that the term rivalry is inaccurate until the Clippers become more successful.  However, with the addition of Chris Paul and Blake Griffin to the Clippers' roster and their emergence as playoff contenders, the rivalry has started to develop in earnest, with a recent matchup between the teams garnering ESPN its highest ratings ever for a regular season broadcast in Los Angeles.  , The San Antonio Spurs and the Lakers, developed what some would classify as a rivalry in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Since 1999, the teams have met in the NBA Playoffs five times, with the clubs combining to appear in seven consecutive NBA Finals (1999–2005). Additionally, the teams combined to win five NBA championships from 1999–2003. The Spurs won the NBA championship in 1999, 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2014 while the Lakers won the championship in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2009 and 2010. From 1999 to 2004 the clubs' rivalry was often considered the premier rivalry in the NBA,  and each time the clubs faced each other in the playoffs the winner advanced to the NBA Finals. In 2008 the teams met again in the Western Conference Finals where the Spurs were handily defeated only to beat LA when they met again in 2013 (though against a Lakers team without an injured Kobe Bryant). , Berger and Chalfen purchased the NBL's disbanded Detroit Gems for $15,000 in 1947, changed their name to the Lakers and relocated them to Minnesota. Max Winter bought a third of the club in their early years, and sold his share to Mikan in 1954. Berger bought Mikan's share in 1956 giving him a controlling (2/3) interest.  After Mikan retired, attendance plummeted and the team lost money for several seasons, leading the ownership group to put the team up for sale in 1957.  Marty Marion , a retired baseball player and manager, and his business partner Milton Fischman attempted to purchase the team with the intention of moving the club to Kansas City, Missouri .   Mikan offered to mortgage his home in an attempt to buy the team and keep the club in Minnesota.  The Lakers were sold to a group of investors led by Bob Short however.  The team was sold to Short's group with the agreement that it would not be relocated to Kansas City but kept in Minnesota.  Short's ownership group consisted of 117 Minnesota businesses and private citizens, who amassed a total of $200,000 for the purchase; $150,000 to buy the team and $50,000 to run it.  By 1958 Short had become 80% owner of the team by buying out his partners,  but the team was floundering. Attendance remained poor, and the NBA had put the Lakers on "financial probation", notifying them that if they did not meet certain ticket sales numbers they could be bought out by the league and relocated. Short was forced to move the team to Los Angeles in 1960; the club had lost $60,000 in the first half of the 1959–60 season alone.  The NBA's owners originally voted 7–1 against the move.  When Short indicated that he might take the team to new rival league that was developing however, the owners held another vote that same day and allowed the relocation (8–0).  Aided by Baylor's drawing power,   and the new locale, the team's finances improved when they arrived in LA.   Short sold the team to Washington Redskins owner and publisher Jack Kent Cooke in 1965 for a then league record amount of $5,175,000.  Short insisted the deal be conducted in cash as he was wary of Cooke, so guards transported the money in a cart from one New York bank to another.  , Cooke was a more hands-on owner than Short, and overhauled the team's operations.  He personally financed construction of the Forum in 1967 at a cost of $16.5 million.   He owned the team until 1979 when he sold it, the NHL's Los Angeles Kings, the Forum, and some real estate to Jerry Buss for $67 million.  Cooke was forced to sell the team as he was undergoing a costly divorce.   Buss was a local chemical engineer and former University of Southern California professor who had become wealthy in real estate.   Philip Anschutz bought a stake in the team in 1998,  and until October 2010 Magic Johnson was a minority owner as well.  Buss started the trend of allowing sponsors to add their name to team's stadiums when he renamed the Forum the Great Western Forum in 1988.  In 2009 major sponsors included Verizon Wireless , Toyota , Anheuser-Busch , American Express , and Carl's Jr. , and the team's $113 average ticket price was the highest in the league.  Fast food chain Jack in the Box is another major sponsor, the company gives all fans in attendance at home games a coupon for two free tacos if the Lakers hold their opponent under 100 points and win. The company also sponsors the team's halftime shows on KCAL-TV and Fox Sports West .  In 2013, Buss died at the age of 80 after being hospitalized for 18 months with cancer.    His controlling ownership of the team passed to his six children via a trust, with each child receiving an equal vote.   Buss' succession plan had daughter Jeanie Buss assume his title as the Lakers' governor as well as its team representative at NBA Board of Governors meetings.   , Given the team's proximity to Hollywood, the Lakers fanbase includes numerous celebrities, many of whom can be seen at the Staples Center during home games.  Jack Nicholson , for example, has held season tickets since the 1970s, and directors reportedly need to work their shooting schedules around Lakers home games.  From 2002 and 2007 the team averaged just over 18,900 fans, which placed them in the top ten in the NBA in attendance. Red Hot Chili Peppers ' song "Magic Johnson" from their 1989 album Mother's Milk is a tribute to the former point guard, and frontman Anthony Kiedis and bassist Michael "Flea" Balzary are frequently seen attending home games. The team has sold out every home game since the 2007–08 season.  As of 2010, the Lakers have the most popular team merchandise among all NBA teams, and Bryant the most popular jersey.  , The Laker nickname came from the state of Minnesota being the Land of 10,000 Lakes .  The team's colors are purple, gold and white.  The Lakers logo consists of the team name, "Los Angeles Lakers" written in purple on top of a gold basketball. Purple uniforms are used for road games and gold uniforms are used for home games. The team also wears white jerseys for Sunday and holiday home games.  , Since the Lakers were established in 1948, the team has missed the playoffs just five times.  The team has 16 NBA titles and has appeared in the NBA Finals 15 other times.  These appearances include eight NBA Finals appearances in the 80s. The best record posted by the team was 69–13, in 1972; the worst record was 21–61, in 2014–15 .  , Abdul-Jabbar holds most individual team records for longevity including most games played, and second most minutes logged. Johnson holds all significant assist records for the club including career assists (10,141), assists in a game (24), and highest assist average for a season (13.1). Johnson also has the most triple doubles , with his 138 over 100 more than the next closest player (Bryant; 17). Elmore Smith holds team records for blocks in a game (17), blocks per game for a season (4.85), and career blocks per game (3.93). The scoring records are mostly shared by Elgin Baylor and Bryant, with Baylor having the highest average for a career (27.4) while Bryant has the highest points scored in a single game (81). Baylor, Bryant and West hold the top five single season scoring averages, with Bryant occupying the numbers one (35.4) and four (31.6) spots, while Baylor has the second (34.8), and third (34.0), and West the fifth (31.3).   , The Lakers hold several NBA records as a team including most consecutive games won overall (33) and most consecutive road games won (16) both of which came during the 1971–72 season.  Highest field-goal percentage for a season at 54.5% (1984–85),  and highest road winning percentage at 0.816 (1971–72).  They also hold records for having (into the 2009–10 season ) the most wins (3,027), the highest winning percentage (61.9%), and the most NBA Finals appearances (31).   The 2000–01 team tied the NBA record for best playoff record at 15–1.  The 1971–72 team holds franchise records in wins (69), most points scored, and largest margin of victory; both of the latter came in the team's 63 point win versus Golden State (162–99).  They also used to hold the record for most wins at home in the regular season (going 36-5 in 1971-72, then 37-4 in both 1976-77 and 1979-1980) before the Boston Celtics set the current record of 40-1 in the 1985-86 season. , The Lakers play their home games at Staples Center , located at L.A. Live in Downtown Los Angeles . Staples Center opened in fall 1999, and seats up to 18,997 for Lakers games.  The Staples Center is also home to the Los Angeles Clippers, the WNBA's Los Angeles Sparks, and the NHL's Los Angeles Kings.  The arena is owned and operated by AEG and L.A. Arena Company.  Before moving to the Staples Center, for 32 seasons (1967–1999), the Lakers played their home games at The Forum in Inglewood, California , located approximately ten miles southwest of the team's current home at Staples Center.  During the 1999 NBA preseason, the Lakers played their home games at the Forum before officially moving into Staples Center, and once again hosted a preseason game versus the Golden State Warriors on October 9, 2009, this time to commemorate the team's 50th anniversary season in Los Angeles.  , In the first seven years in Los Angeles, the team played their home games at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena , south of Downtown Los Angeles.  While the team played in Minneapolis, the team played their home games at the Minneapolis Auditorium , from 1947 to 1960.  , , The Lakers hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who isn't signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.  This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. , The Lakers have had three first overall picks in their history: Elgin Baylor (selected in 1958 ), Magic Johnson (selected in 1979 ) and James Worthy (selected in 1982).  The Lakers have also had two Lottery picks in their history: Eddie Jones (selected tenth overall in 1994 ) and Andrew Bynum (selected tenth overall in 2005).

Green and Vlade Divac in the 1980s, Elden Campbell , Nick Van Exel , Derek Fisher, and Devean George in the 1990s, and Luke Walton , Sasha Vujačić , and Ronny Turiaf in the 2000s.  , There have been 22 head coaches for the Lakers franchise. John Kundla coached the team in Minneapolis when they won their first five BAA/NBA championships , from 1949 to 1954 .  Pat Riley is second in franchise history in both regular season and playoff games coached and wins.  Phil Jackson broke Riley's regular season wins record in 2009, and he passed Riley's playoff wins and games coached records in 2010.  Jackson, Riley, Kundla, and Bill Sharman have all been inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame for their coaching careers. George Mikan , Jim Pollard, Jerry West , Pat Riley , Magic Johnson, and Kurt Rambis have all played and head coached for the Lakers. Jackson, who had two stints as head coach, was coach from 2005–2006 until 2010–2011. Mike Brown was named his replacement for the 2011–2012 season in May 2011.  Brown was fired  on November 9, 2012 after a 1-4 start.

He broadcast 3,338 consecutive games between November 21, 1965, and December 16, 2001.  Hearn came up with West's "Mr. Clutch" nickname.  He was a part of the team's "inner sanctum" when Cooke was owner, and was consulted on basketball decisions.  Paul Sunderland , who had filled in for a couple of games while Hearn recuperated in 2001–02 , was named the permanent play-by-play announcer. Stu Lantz was retained as the color commentator .

Meanwhile, John Ireland joined Mychal Thompson to call the games on radio.  , As of the 2009–10 season, Lakers radio broadcasts are heard on KSPN (Los Angeles ESPN Radio affiliate) in English and KWKW in Spanish.   KLAC had the team's radio broadcast rights from the 1976–77 season until the 2008–09 season.   Until 2011, telecasts had been split between KCAL-TV (road games) and Fox Sports West (home games), unless they are chosen for national broadcasts on ABC .  KCAL had been the Lakers' over-the-air television broadcaster since 1977, dating back to when the station was the RKO General -owned KHJ-TV, the longest relationship between an NBA team and a television station. Prior to KHJ, Laker games were televised on KTLA . The Lakers had been on Fox Sports West since 1985, dating to when it was the original Prime Ticket and owned by Buss.  , On February 14, 2011, Time Warner Cable and the Lakers announced the formation of two new regional sports networks (one in English, one in Spanish) that will exclusively televise the team's games and related programming for 20 years starting with the 2012–13 NBA season.  The said networks eventually became Time Warner Cable SportsNet and Time Warner Cable Deportes .  The Cleveland Cavaliers , also known as the Cavs , are an American professional basketball team based in Cleveland , Ohio , that competes in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The team began play in the league in 1970 as an expansion team. Home games are held at Quicken Loans Arena , which the team shares with the Cleveland Gladiators of the Arena Football League and the Lake Erie Monsters of the American Hockey League . The Cavaliers play in the Central Division of the Eastern Conference , the only remaining charter member of the division (all the other Central Division teams joined later from the now-defunct Midwest Division ). , The Cavaliers have featured many NBA stars during their history, including All-Stars Austin Carr , Brad Daugherty , Zydrunas Ilgauskas , Mark Price , LeBron James and Kyrie Irving . Past NBA greats such as Nate Thurmond , Lenny Wilkens , Walt "Clyde" Frazier , and Shaquille O'Neal have also played in Cleveland (albeit near the end of their careers). , The team has won four Central Division championships (1976, 2009, 2010 and 2015), two Eastern Conference championships (2007 and 2015), and has had 19 total playoff seasons. However, the team has also had a number of dubious distinctions, such as former owner Ted Stepien 's tenure, which led the NBA to create a rule regulating the trading of draft picks ("The Stepien Rule"), and a 26-game losing streak in 2010–11, which tied the record for the longest losing streak in major American professional sports. , , , The Cavaliers first began play in the NBA in 1970 as an expansion team under the ownership of Nick Mileti . Jerry Tomko, the father of future Major League Baseball pitcher Brett Tomko , submitted the winning entry to name the team the "Cavaliers" through a competition sponsored by The Plain Dealer ; supporters preferred it to "Jays", "Foresters" and "Presidents".   Playing their home games at Cleveland Arena under the direction of head coach Bill Fitch , they compiled a league-worst 15–67 record in their inaugural season. The team hoped to build around the number one 1971 draft pick Austin Carr , who had set numerous scoring records at Notre Dame , but Carr severely injured his leg shortly into his pro career and never was able to realize his potential. , The following seasons saw the Cavaliers gradually improve their on-court performance, thanks to season-by-season additions of talented players such as Bobby "Bingo" Smith , Jim Chones , Jim Cleamons and Dick Snyder . The Cavaliers improved to 23–59 in their sophomore season , followed by a 32–50 record in 1972–73, and 29–53 in 1973–74. , In 1974, the Cavaliers moved into the brand-new Richfield Coliseum , located in rural Richfield, Ohio - 20 miles (32 km) south of downtown Cleveland in Summit County (now part of the Cuyahoga Valley National Park ). The move was done as the Cleveland Arena had fallen into disrepair, and the location was chosen in an effort to draw fans in from nearby Akron and other areas of Northeast Ohio .  That season , the Cavaliers finished with a 40–42 record, falling just short of a playoff berth. , In the 1975–76 season with Carr, Smith, Chones, Snyder, and newly acquired Nate Thurmond , Fitch led the Cavaliers to a 49–33 record and a division title. Fitch received the league's Coach of the Year award as the Cavs made their first-ever playoff appearance, and clinched their first Central Division Title. , In the playoffs , the Cavs won their series against the Washington Bullets , 4–3. Because of the many heroics and last-second shots, the series became known locally as the "Miracle of Richfield." They won Game 7, 87–85, on a shot by Snyder with four seconds to go. But the team became hampered by injuries—particularly to Jim Chones, who suffered a broken ankle. , The Cavs proceeded to lose to the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals. It is widely believed among both Cavs fans and players that the "Miracle" team would have won the 1976 NBA Championship had Chones stayed healthy.  , Cleveland won 43 games in both of the 1976–77 and 1977–78 seasons, but both seasons resulted in early playoff exits. After a 30–52 season in 1978–79 , Fitch resigned as head coach. , The following season , after going 37–45 under Fitch's successor Stan Albeck , original owner Mileti sold his shares to minority owner Joe Zingale. In 1980, after just a few months, Zingale sold the team to Nationwide Advertising magnate Ted Stepien on April 12, 1980.  Early on in his tenure, Stepien proposed to rename the team the "Ohio Cavaliers", part of a plan that included playing their home games not just in the Cleveland area but in Cincinnati and in non-Ohio markets such as Buffalo and Pittsburgh . He also made changes to the game day entertainment, such as introducing a polka -flavored fight song and a dance team known as "The Teddy Bears". Stepien also oversaw the hiring and firing of a succession of coaches and was involved in making a number of poor trade and free agent signing decisions. The result of his questionable trading acumen was the loss of several of the team's first-round draft picks, which led to a rule change in the NBA prohibiting teams from trading away first-round draft picks in consecutive years. This rule is known as the "Ted Stepien Rule". , The ensuing chaos had a major effect on both the Cavaliers' on-court performance and lack of local support, going 28–54 in 1980–81 (Stepien's first year as owner), followed by an abysmal 15–67 mark in 1981–82 . The 1981–82 team lost its last 19 games of the season which, when coupled with the five losses at the start of the 1982–83 season , constitute the NBA's second all-time longest losing streak at 24 games . Although the team improved its record to 23–59 the following year, local support for the Cavs eroded which eventually bottomed out that year by averaging only 3,900 fans a game at the cavernous Coliseum which seated more than 20,000. , Though Stepien eventually threatened to move the franchise to Toronto and rename it the Toronto Towers, brothers George and Gordon Gund purchased the Cavaliers in the mid-1980s and decided to keep the team in Cleveland. As an incentive to the Gunds, NBA owners awarded the team bonus first-round picks for each year from 1983 to 1986 to help compensate for the ones Stepien traded away.  , Shortly after purchasing the Cavaliers in 1983, the Gunds changed the team colors from wine and gold to burnt orange and navy blue. Furthermore, they officially adopted "Cavs" as a shorter nickname for marketing purposes, as it had been used unofficially by fans and headline writers since the team's inception. , Under the coaching of George Karl , the Cavaliers failed again, and missed the playoffs, with a 28–54 record, in the 1983–84 season. The Cavs finally returned to the playoffs in 1985 , only to lose to the eventual Eastern Conference Champion Boston Celtics in the first round. At that point, the team was in transition, led by dynamic players such as World B. Free , Roy Hinson and John Bagley . But in 1986, Karl was fired after 66 games. Interim head coach Gene Littles guided the team the rest of the way, which saw the Cavs finish one game short of the playoffs. During the seven-season period, the Cavaliers had nine head coaches: Stan Albeck , Bill Musselman , Don Delaney , Bob Kloppenburg , Chuck Daly , Bill Musselman (again), Tom Nissalke , George Karl , and Gene Littles . The only playoff appearance earned during this stretch was during the 1984–85 season under Karl, losing to the Boston Celtics in the first round in four games (1–3). , In 1986, the Cavaliers acquired, either through trades or the draft , Brad Daugherty , Mark Price , Ron Harper and Larry Nance . Those four players (until Harper was later traded to the Los Angeles Clippers in 1989 for the rights to Danny Ferry ) formed the core of the team, under the direction of head coach Lenny Wilkens , that led the Cavs to eight playoff seasons in the next nine years, including three seasons of 50 or more wins. , In 1989, the Cavs were paired against the Michael Jordan-led Chicago Bulls in the first round of the playoffs . In the fourth game of the best-of-five-series, Cleveland managed to beat the Bulls in overtime 108–105 to level the series at 2–2. Home court advantage went to Cleveland. The game was evenly matched, until Cleveland managed to score on a drive and raise the lead by one, with three seconds left. Chicago called for a time-out. The ball was inbounded to Michael Jordan , who went for a jump shot. Cleveland's Craig Ehlo jumped in front to block it, but Jordan seemed to stay in the air until Ehlo landed. " The Shot " went in as time ran out, with Chicago winning the series 3–2. The buzzer-beater is considered one of Jordan's greatest clutch moments, the game itself one of the greatest in NBA history, and the series a classic. But the pinnacle of the Cavs' success came in the 1991–92 season, when they compiled a 57–25 record and advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals , losing again to the Chicago Bulls 4–2. , Soon after, the Cavaliers entered into a period of decline. With the retirements and departures of Nance, Daugherty, and Price, the team lost much of its dominance and were no longer able to contest strongly during the playoffs. After the 1992–93 season, in which the Cavs had a 54–28 regular-season record but suffered an early exit from the playoffs in the Eastern Conference Semi-Finals to the Chicago Bulls, Wilkens left to coach the Atlanta Hawks . , Following the hiring of Mike Fratello as head coach starting with the 1993–94 season , the Cavs became one of the NBA's best defensive teams under the leadership of point guard Terrell Brandon . But the offense, which was a half-court, "slow-down" tempo installed by Fratello, met with mixed success. Although the Cavaliers made regular playoff appearances, they were unable to advance beyond the first round. In the 1994 NBA Playoffs , the last which Daugherty and Nance played in, the Cavaliers yet again met the Chicago Bulls in the first round, led by Scottie Pippen in the wake of Jordan's first retirement. The Bulls proved that it was not just the "Jordan Curse", and would prevail yet again sweeping the Cavs 3–0 in the first round encounter. , In 1994, the Cavs moved back to downtown Cleveland with the opening of the 20,562-seat, state-of-the-art Gund Arena . Known by locals as "the Gund", the venue served as the site of the 1997 NBA All-Star Game . The arena and the Cleveland Indians ' Jacobs Field were built together as part of the city's Gateway project. , The Cavs revamped their starting lineup during the 1997 off-season, sending guard Bobby Phills , and forward Chris Mills to free agency, and trading Terrell Brandon and Tyrone Hill to the Milwaukee Bucks as part of a three-team trade. They acquired All-Star forward Shawn Kemp from the Seattle SuperSonics (from the three-team trade involving Cleveland, Seattle and Milwaukee) and guard Wesley Person from the Phoenix Suns . Later on, players like Kemp and Žydrūnas Ilgauskas added quality to the team, but without further post-season success. The Cavs did have five All-Stars/All-Rookies in 1998 with Kemp a starting All-Star for the East, Brevin Knight and Ilgauskas on the All-Rookie First Team, and Cedric Henderson and Derek Anderson on the All-Rookie Second Team. No other NBA team has ever been represented by five players at the All-Star celebration or four players as All-Rookies in the same year. Still, in the three seasons that Kemp played for the Cavs, they managed only one playoff appearance and one playoff win. Fratello was fired following the shortened 1998–99 season. , Despite the arrivals of Andre Miller , Brevin Knight , Lamond Murray , Chris Mihm and Carlos Boozer , the Cavs were a perennial lottery team for the early part of the 2000s. The 2002–03 team finished with the third-worst record in franchise history (17–65), which earned them a tie for last place in the league and a 22.5 percent chance at winning the NBA Draft Lottery and the first overall selection. , Ricky Davis received national attention on March 16, 2003, in game against the Utah Jazz . With Cleveland ahead in the game 120–95, Davis was one rebound short of a triple-double with only a few seconds left on the clock. After receiving an inbound pass at the Cavs' end of the floor, Davis banged the ball off the rim and caught it in attempt to receive credit for a rebound. Utah's DeShawn Stevenson took offense to this breach of sportsman's etiquette and immediately fouled Davis hard.  The play did not count as a rebound since firing at your own team's basket does not count as a shot attempt, and in fact is a technical foul under NBA rules. Since the referees had never seen anyone shoot at his own basket before, they were unfamiliar with the rule and play was allowed to continue. This (which led to Davis being nicknamed in Cleveland as "Wrong Rim Ricky") and countless other selfish acts contributed to the Cavs trading of Davis later that year and ushering in a new type of team.  , Several losing seasons followed which saw the Cavaliers drop to the bottom of the league and become a perennial lottery draft team. After another disappointing season in 2002–03 , the Cavaliers landed the number one draft pick in the NBA Lottery . With it, the team selected local high school phenomenon and future NBA MVP LeBron James. As if celebrating a new era in Cleveland Cavaliers basketball, the team's colors were changed from orange, black and blue back to wine and gold, with the addition of navy blue and a new primary logo. , James' status as both an area star (having played his high school basketball at St. Vincent-St. Mary High School in nearby Akron ) and as one of the most highly touted prospects in NBA history has led many to view his selection as a turning point in the franchise's history. Embraced by Cleveland as "King James," the 2003–04 season offered great hope for the future, as James rose to become a dominating player, winning the NBA Rookie of the Year Award . Hope was even greater for the 2004–05 season. James increased his production in terms of points, rebounds, and assists per game. Despite the loss of Carlos Boozer in the offseason, James teamed with Žydrūnas Ilgauskas and Drew Gooden to form the core of the team. After a promising start, the Cavs began a downward spiral that eventually led to the firing of coach Paul Silas and general manager Jim Paxson . The team failed to make the playoffs that year, tied with New Jersey Nets for the final playoff spot with identical 42–40 records; however, the Nets owned the tiebreaker due to having the better head to head record. , The Cavaliers made many changes in the 2005 offseason. Under new owner Dan Gilbert , the team hired a new head coach, Mike Brown , and a new general manager, former Cavaliers forward Danny Ferry . The team experienced success on the court in the following season , clinching their first playoff appearance since 1998 . After a first round win over the Washington Wizards , the Cavaliers rebounded from a 0–2 deficit in the second round against the #1 seeded Detroit Pistons , winning three consecutive games to come one game away from the conference finals. They lost a close Game 6 at home, and followed it with a 79–61 loss in Game 7. The playoff rounds were a showcase for the emergence of LeBron James, who achieved many "youngest ever to..." records during the run. , The Cavs continued their success in the 2006–07 season. The team earned the second seed in the East with a 50–32 record, generating a series of favorable matchups in the playoffs . They battled 7th-seeded Wizards, who struggled with injuries near the end of the season. The Cavaliers swept this series 4–0, and defeated the New Jersey Nets , 4–2, in the second round. The Cavaliers faced the Pistons in the Eastern Conference Finals. After again losing the first two games at Detroit, the Cavaliers won the next three to take a 3–2 series lead. This time, the Cavaliers eliminated Detroit in Game 6. The wins included a 109–107 double-overtime game at The Palace of Auburn Hills in Game 5, in which LeBron James scored the last 25 points for the Cavs, and his performance in this game is recognized as one of the best in NBA history. They continued to a dominant 98–82 win at home in Game 6. Rookie Daniel "Boobie" Gibson scored a career-high 31 points in the series clincher, and the franchise won its first ever Eastern Conference Championship. The team's first trip to the NBA Finals was a short one, as they were outmatched and outplayed by the deeper, more experienced San Antonio Spurs , who swept the Cavs 4–0. , The Cavs took a step back in the 2007–08 season . They battled injuries and had many roster changes, including a three team trade at the trade deadline in which the team acquired F Joe Smith , G-F Wally Szczerbiak , F-C Ben Wallace , and G Delonte West . The Cavs finished 45–37 and lost in the second round against eventual champion Boston. The next off-season, the team made a major change to its lineup, trading G Damon Jones and Smith (who later in the season rejoined the Cavs after being released by Oklahoma City ) for point guard Mo Williams . This trade was made in hopes of bringing another scorer to aid James. , In the next season , the Cavs made astounding progress. They finished with a record of 66–16, the best record and regular season in franchise history. The year marked other notable franchise records, including a 13-game winning streak, and road and home winning records. The Cavs entered the playoffs as the #1 seed in the NBA with home court advantage throughout the playoffs. They finished the season 39–2 at home, one win short of the best all-time home record . Head Coach Mike Brown won NBA Coach of the Year honors and LeBron James finished second in the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award and won the NBA MVP . The Cavs began the 2009 postseason by sweeping the 8th-seeded Detroit Pistons , winning every game by 10 or more points. In the conference semifinals, the Cavaliers swept the 4th-seeded Atlanta Hawks , again winning each game by at least ten points, becoming the first team in NBA history to win eight straight playoff games by a double-digit margin. The Cavs then met the Orlando Magic in the Eastern Conference Finals. The Cavs lost Game 1 of the series 107–106 at home despite James' 49-point effort. Despite winning Game 2 by a score of 96–95, with the help of a James buzzer-beating three-pointer, it was not enough as Orlando won the series in six games. , During the 2009 off-season, the Cavs acquired four-time NBA Champion and 15-time All Star center Shaquille O'Neal from the Phoenix Suns.  The Cavs also signed wingman Anthony Parker , and forwards Leon Powe and Jamario Moon for the following season . On February 17, 2010, the Cavaliers acquired All-Star forward Antawn Jamison from the Washington Wizards and Sebastian Telfair from the Los Angeles Clippers in a three team trade. The Cavaliers originally lost Žydrūnas Ilgauskas in this trade, but after being waived by Washington, he signed back with the Cavaliers on March 23 for the rest of the season. The Cavaliers managed to finish with the NBA's best record for the second straight season, with a 61–21 record. James was named the NBA MVP , for the second consecutive year. The Cavaliers defeated the Chicago Bulls 4–1 in the first round of the 2010 NBA Playoffs but, in a huge upset, lost to the Boston Celtics after leading the series 2–1, with the Celtics proceeding to win 3 consecutive games (afterwards, the Celtics went to the 2010 NBA Finals and lost to the Los Angeles Lakers 4–3.) Each team would suffer record-setting playoff defeats on home soil; the Celtics lost by 29, 124–95, in Game 3, the greatest defeat in the history of the Boston Celtics in the playoffs, while the Cavaliers lost by 32, 120–88, in Game 5. , With the Cavaliers out of the playoffs, the focus then turned to James' impending free agency. On July 8, 2010, James announced in a nationally televised one hour special titled The Decision on ESPN that he would be signing with the Miami Heat .  The repercussions of this announcement left many in the city of Cleveland infuriated and feeling betrayed. A number of LeBron James jerseys were burned, and the famous Nike "Witness" mural of James in downtown Cleveland was immediately taken down. , Shortly after James made his announcement, Dan Gilbert, the owner of the Cavaliers, announced in an open letter on the Cavaliers website (since dubbed as "The Letter" by some) that James' decision was a "cowardly betrayal" and promised a NBA championship for the Cleveland Cavaliers before LeBron James wins one,  although James would win a championship before the Cavs with the Heat's championship in 2012 . Despite being ridiculed for the letter by the media, Cleveland fans embraced the owner, even offering to pay the $100,000 fine given by the NBA. , During the 2010 offseason, before LeBron James left the team, the Cavaliers fired head coach Mike Brown , along with most of their coaching staff. General Manager Danny Ferry resigned on June 4, 2010 and Assistant General Manager Chris Grant was promoted to replace Ferry. On July 1, the Cavaliers hired former Los Angeles Lakers guard and former New Jersey Nets and New Orleans Hornets head coach Byron Scott as the 18th head coach in franchise history. , The Cavaliers spent the rest of the 2010 off-season rebuilding their team after James' departure. They signed 2009 first-round pick Christian Eyenga and acquired Ramon Sessions and Ryan Hollins from the Minnesota Timberwolves in a trade that saw the Cavs give away Delonte West and Sebastian Telfair . The Cavaliers also signed free agent Joey Graham and undrafted rookies Samardo Samuels and Manny Harris . The Cavs were also active at the trade deadline in February 2011. They acquired former All-Star Baron Davis and a 2011 first round draft pick from the L.A. Clippers in exchange for Mo Williams and Jamario Moon .  , On the court, the 2010–11 season was a stark contrast from the previous season. They went from a league-best 61 wins in 2009-10 to a conference-worst 19, the biggest single-season drop in NBA history. This season also saw the Cavs lose 63 games, including a 26-game losing streak, which set an NBA record and tied the 1976–77 Tampa Bay Buccaneers for the longest losing streak in any American professional team sport. , Having the second-worst team record in the 2010–11 season as well as the Clippers' first round pick that they received in the Mo Williams / Baron Davis trade, the Cavaliers had high odds of winning an early draft pick in the NBA Draft Lottery , with a 22.7% chance of their pick becoming #1 overall.  The selection acquired from the Clippers became the first pick in the lottery, while the Cavaliers original selection ended up as the #4 selection in the draft. The Cavaliers took Duke Blue Devils guard Kyrie Irving with the first pick. With the 4th pick, the Cavaliers selected Texas Longhorns power forward Tristan Thompson . The Cavaliers used the next year to build around the two top-5 picks. They acquired small forward Omri Casspi and a lottery-protected first-round draft pick from the Sacramento Kings for forward J.J. Hickson . At the next year's trade deadline, the Cavaliers acquired forward Luke Walton and a first-round draft pick from the Los Angeles Lakers . The 2011–12 lockout shortened season was an improvement for the Cavs, as they finished 21–45. Irving was named NBA Rookie of the Year and was unanimously voted to the NBA All-Rookie First Team . Thompson was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team . , For the second straight year, the Cavaliers had two first-round picks in the NBA Draft .  With their own #4 pick, they chose guard Dion Waiters from Syracuse , and with pick #17 (which was acquired from Dallas on draft night), they chose center Tyler Zeller from North Carolina .  In August 2012, the Cavaliers signed veteran free agent swingman C.J. Miles .  The team struggled in 2012-13, which led to them sacking head coach Byron Scott after a 64–166 record in three seasons.  The following week, the Cavaliers rehired Mike Brown as head coach, making him the second two-time head coach in team history, after Bill Musselman in the early 1980s.   , The Cavaliers had several early picks in 2013 . They won the 2013 NBA Draft Lottery to receive the first overall pick. They also had the 19th pick (acquired from the Los Angeles Lakers ), as well as two out of the top three picks in the second round.   For the third straight year the Cavs had two picks in the first round of the NBA Draft . The Cavaliers made somewhat of a surprise pick when they drafted forward Anthony Bennett of UNLV . This made Bennett the first Canadian born player in history to be the number one pick. With the 19th pick, the Cavaliers took swingman Sergey Karasev out of Russia .  The Cavaliers signed free agent forward Earl Clark to a two-year contract and veteran guard Jarrett Jack to a four-year deal.   The Cavaliers also signed two-time NBA Champion and former All-Star center Andrew Bynum to a one-year contract.    Bynum would then be traded on January 7, 2014 to the Chicago Bulls (along with draft picks) for two-time All-Star forward Luol Deng .  , The Cavs struggled through the 2013–14 season as on February 6, they fired GM Chris Grant . The team then announced that VP of basketball operations David Griffin would serve as acting GM.  On May 12, 2014, the Cavs announced that Griffin had been named as the full-time GM, while also announcing that Mike Brown had been fired after only one season in his second stint with the team following going 33–49. The Cavs won the #1 draft pick in the 2014 Draft Lottery, making it the third time in four years they would win the lottery.  , On June 20, 2014, the Cavaliers signed longtime Euroleague coach David Blatt —who had just led Maccabi Tel Aviv to the 2014 Euroleague Championship , and named 2014 Euroleague Coach of the Year—to become head coach of the Cavs.  Three days later, the team hired former two-time NBA Championship -winning player and veteran assistant coach Tyronn Lue as their new associate head coach, making him the NBA's highest-paid assistant coach in the process.  On June 26, the Cavaliers selected swingman Andrew Wiggins from Kansas as the No. 1 pick of the 2014 NBA Draft .  , On July 11, 2014, written in Sports Illustrated , free agent LeBron James announced his return to the Cavaliers after leaving the team in 2010 under controversial circumstances .   The content of the essay had been based on the city where he is from. On July 15, the Cavaliers signed James' former Miami Heat teammate, swingman Mike Miller (who was part of Miami's two NBA championship seasons), coming from the Memphis Grizzlies .  The next day, the Cavaliers signed another one of James' former two-time champion Heat teammates, swingman James Jones , to a one-year contract.  , On August 7, it was reported that the Minnesota Timberwolves had agreed to a three-team deal with Cleveland along with the Philadelphia 76ers to trade three-time All-Star forward Kevin Love to the Cavaliers in exchange for Wiggins, Anthony Bennett , and a future first-round draft pick. Philadelphia was to send Thaddeus Young to Minnesota in exchange for the draft pick, and Luc Mbah a Moute went to Philadelphia. By NBA rules, the deal could not become official until August 23, upon which it was formally announced.  Because Wiggins had signed his rookie contract on July 24, league rules prohibited him from being traded until 30 days after his signing; the trade was finalized once the 30-day window expired on August 23.  , On August 17, the Cavs signed four-time All Star and former NBA champion Shawn Marion to a one-year contract, as the veteran forward was a free agent after playing with the Dallas Mavericks the past five seasons.  , The 2014–15 season started 19–20 after 39 games. During the week of January 5, 2015, the Cavaliers traded Dion Waiters (along with various other players and draft picks) in a pair of deals and acquired swingman J. R. Smith and guard Iman Shumpert from the New York Knicks, along with center Timofey Mozgov from the Denver Nuggets.  Mozgov and Smith were inserted into the starting lineup, while Shumpert became a top reserve. Beginning on January 15, the team's fortunes changed, as the Cavs went 34–9 the rest of the regular season On January 28, Irving set a record for most points in Quicken Loans Arena history as he scored 55 points, leading the Cavs to a 99–94 win over the Portland Trail Blazers .  On March 12, he established a new team record for most points scored in a single game with 57 in a 128–125 overtime win against the San Antonio Spurs in San Antonio, surpassing James, who had held the record with 56. Irving did so while shooting a perfect 7-for-7 on three-point shot attempts and 10-for-10 on free throws. He also had several three-point plays in the game as well as two crucial three-point shots in the closing seconds of regulation to send the game into overtime, including the final shot at the buzzer. He then went on to score 11 of the Cavs' 18 points in overtime. With these two games, Irving ended the season having the top two individual high scoring performances.  At the end of the season, the Cavs had a 53-29 regular-season record and clinched a playoff spot on March 20, marking a return to postseason play after a four-year absence. On April 8, with a 104–99 win against the Milwaukee Bucks , the Cavs clinched the second seed in the Eastern Conference and won the Central Division title. , In round one of the Eastern Conference playoffs, the Cavs swept the Boston Celtics 4–0 to advance to the next round, but lost Kevin Love in the process after suffering a dislocated shoulder when Celtics forward Kelly Olynyk grabbed Love in what has been regarded by Love as a "dirty play" and a purposeful arm bar .  Despite that, the Cavs then beat the Chicago Bulls four games to two in the Eastern Conference semifinals to advance to the Eastern Conference finals against the Atlanta Hawks. The Cavs swept the Hawks, four games to none to win the team's second Eastern Conference title, and advance to the NBA Finals. , Games 1 & 2 of the 2015 NBA Finals saw a pair of overtime games, in which game 1 went to the favored Golden State Warriors and game 2 went to the Cavaliers. Prior to Game 2, it was announced that an already hobbled Kyrie Irving suffered a broken kneecap in game 1, and would miss the rest of the season. , The Cavs - who had been dubbed by James as "The Grit Squad" due to the team adopting a tough, physical style of play in the absence of All-Stars Irving and Kevin Love - were able to take a 2-1 series lead with a game 3 win in Cleveland.  The city quickly embraced the team's new image, identifying itself through the team's new found scrappy style of play.  Backup point guard Matthew Dellavedova in particular became the embodiment of this new image, becoming something of a cult hero in Cleveland and even nationally due to his hard nosed playing style.  , However, beginning with game 4 the Warriors switched to a smaller, faster lineup (starting swingman Andre Iguodala in place of center Andrew Bogut ), the undermanned and exhausted Cavs proceeded to lose the next three games to Golden State, thus losing the series 4-2. James finished the series averaging a historic 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game. , When the Cleveland Cavaliers debuted in the NBA in 1970, the team's original jerseys were wine and gold. The first jerseys featured the feathered treatment of the letter C in Cavaliers. In 1974, they changed into the classic block lettering and checkerboard pattern that was synonymous to the 'Miracle of Richfield' teams of 1976. In 1980, the gold shade was changed from yellowish to metallic, and the uniforms removed the checkerboard pattern and placed the stripes above Cleveland and below the uniform number, the only time the city name was featured in both home and away jerseys. , The original logo was that of swashbuckling cavalier looking right with a sword pointing, surrounded by the team name and a basketball. A modernized swashbuckling cavalier logo was later used by the Cavaliers' NBA Development League affiliates, the Canton Charge . , The gold checkerboard uniforms were used as throwbacks in the 2004–05 season to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the 'Miracle of Richfield' team, while the gold 'Feathered C' uniforms were used again in the 2008–09 season, as a buildup to the then-upcoming 40th season of the Cavaliers. , In the 1983–84 season, the colors were changed to burnt orange, blue and white. The first Cavaliers uniform under the new scheme featured the Cavs logo (with a V in the shape of a hoop and circle above as basketball) in an arched pattern and the player name sewn onto the back shoulder as a patch, with orange being the primary color in both the away and home uniforms. However, in the 1987–88 season, orange was relegated as a secondary color, and blue was used instead as the primary for the away and home uniforms; minor changes in the 1989–90 season include the city name on the blue away uniforms. The drop shadows were also removed. , The orange version of the uniform was used again in the 2006–07 season, as part of the 20th anniversary of the 1986–87 team, while the blue versions were worn in the 2009–10 season as part of the franchise's 40th anniversary and as a tribute to the 1988–89 team. , Coinciding with the move to Gund Arena in the 1994–95 season, the Cavs changed logos and uniforms, adding black in addition to the already existing blue, orange and white colors. The uniforms feature a blue splash in the abdomen area in front. From 1994 to 1997 the word 'CAVS' on the home uniforms were orange with black line, while the numbers are in black with white line, while 'CLEVELAND' on the road uniforms were also orange with black line, while the number are in white with a black line. From 1997 to 1999 the numbers and lettering were slightly tweaked. The word 'CAVS' and the numbers on the home uniforms are in black with orange line, while the word 'CLEVELAND' and the numbers on the road uniforms are in white with orange line. In the latter iteration, the blue splash was moved from the right leg to the left leg, surrounding 'CLEVELAND' on the home uniforms and 'CAVS' on the road uniforms, with a minor change in striping. , In the 1999–2000 season, the Cavaliers opted to go for a cleaner look, eliminating the splash and adding an orange and blue line that runs through the shorts. The home jerseys feature the team nickname and the uniform numbers are in blue with black line, while on the away jerseys, they feature the city name and the uniform numbers in white with blue line. They were used until the 2002–03 season. , The logo used in this period was of a basketball on its way down the net, surrounded by a black square and the word 'CAVS' in blue with black line below. , The Cavaliers switched to a modified version of the team's classic wine and gold scheme in the 2003–04 season (metallic gold and crimson shade of wine), with navy blue added to the color scheme. , The home uniform was white, with the word "Cavaliers" in wine lettering with gold trim on the front, the player's name in wine lettering with gold trim on the back, the player's numbers in navy blue, and wine and gold trim on the sides. , The team's standard road uniform was wine-colored, with the word "Cleveland," the player's name, and the player's numbers all in white lettering with gold trim, as well as white and gold trim on the sides. , The team's third/alternate uniform was navy blue with the word "Cleveland", the player's name, and the player's numbers all in white lettering with gold trim, as well as a wine, gold, and navy blue checkerboard trim. The checkerboard trim was a tribute to the original Cavaliers uniforms from the '70s. , The logo used is a gold sword piercing to the words 'Cleveland Cavaliers' in white and navy trim, with a wine basketball surrounding it. , The Cavaliers debuted new uniforms before the start of the 2010–11 NBA season , to coincide with the team returning to the original shades of wine and gold used from 1970 to 1983.  , The home uniform is white with a wine and gold horizontal stripe trim on the collar, sleeves, waistband, and pant legs, "Cavaliers" (in block style lettering) in wine on the front of the jersey, with wine lettering for the name and number, and white shoes and socks. , The road uniform is wine colored with the same stripe trim, "Cleveland" in gold on the front of the jersey, and gold lettering on the name and number, with black shoes and socks. , An alternate third uniform was added for the 2012–13 season, which is gold with "CAVS" in wine on the front of the jersey, wine lettering on the name and number, white socks and shoes, and the same stripe trim as the other uniforms.  , All uniforms have the team motto "All For One, One for All" stitched on the inside of the collar, and the secondary "Sword C" logo on the side of the pant legs. The logo used is the same piercing sword logo, updated to the classic wine and gold scheme. , For the 2014–15 season, a second alternate uniform (and fourth uniform overall) was added, which is navy blue (a callback to the 1987-94 style) with "CAVS" and the player's number in wine with gold trim, the player's name on the back of the jersey in gold, and the "Sword C" logo on the side of the pant legs.  , Beginning in the 2008–09 season, the Cavaliers began wearing special "mash-up" uniforms (combining the style from one era with the color scheme of another) on select "Cavs Fanatic" Nights—a promotion to plug the CavFanatic.com fan site . , In '08–'10 the team wore the original "Feathered C" uniforms but with the 1994–2003 shade of blue combined with the classic wine and gold shade. , In 2009–10, the team wore their 1987–89 uniforms, but in the classic wine and gold from the 'Miracle of Richfield' era. , In 2010–11, the team wore the 2005–10 checkerboard alternate uniforms, but in the 1994–2003 color scheme of blue, black and orange. , In 2011–12, the team wore a variation of the current uniform design, but in the classic shade of blue used from 1987 to 1994. The word 'CAVS', player name and numbers are in the current lettering and in the wine and gold scheme. , In 2007 the Cavaliers opened their practice facility and team headquarters, Cleveland Clinic Courts, in Independence, Ohio (a Cleveland suburb). It replaced the former single-court center the team used within Quicken Loans Arena . , The Cavaliers hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.  This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. ,  , NBA Most Valuable Player , NBA Rookie of the Year , NBA Coach of the Year , NBA Executive of the Year , NBA Sportsmanship Award , J.

Either Chones (home games) or former Ohio State standout and NBA player Brad Sellers (road games) will join Snyder for the postgame show. , WLFM-LP (87.7 FM) serves as the Spanish language radio home of the Cavaliers, with the 2014–15 season marking the first time the Cavaliers have been broadcast in a second language. Rafael Hernandez Brito serves as the Spanish language play-by-play announcer, as well as hosting pregame and postgame shows.  , On television, the Cavaliers air on Fox Sports Ohio , with select games simulcast on WUAB (TV channel 43).  The broadcast team includes play-by-play announcer Fred McLeod ; analyst Austin Carr , a former Cavalier; and sideline reporter Allie Clifton. Jeff Phelps and former Cavalier Campy Russell host the pregame, halftime, and postgame shows.  , Whammer is the former mascot of the Cavs. He is a polar bear who is said to have grown up in the tundra and still makes occasional appearances throughout the season at Cavalier games. At halftime he used to dunk a basketball. Whammer's debut was in a November 9, 1995 game against the Chicago Bulls . , Recently when Moondog , the current Cavaliers mascot was asked what Whammer was up to these days he responded "He e-mails the braintrust of the Cavs about twice a week trying to get his old job back. I throw him a bone occasionally and invite him back, mostly to mock him. Finally he's good for a laugh."  , Moondog is the official mascot of the Cavaliers. Like a growing number of NBA Mascots, the character has a unique connection not just to the team, but to the city and surrounding area. Cleveland is known worldwide as the rock and roll city, due to famed Cleveland radio disc jockey Alan Freed , who popularized the phrase "rock and roll", breaking new ground and sparking a music explosion. , Freed called himself the " Moondog ", and his listeners were "Moondoggers". When the Cavaliers looked to create a new mascot which represents the city, Moondog was a natural selection. Like Alan Freed, the mascot aims to be innovative, fun-loving, passionate and controversial. , Moondog was an NBA All-Star selection in 2003 and 2004. He is best known for his behind the back half-court shot and fierce loyalty to his Cavaliers. His first appearance was on November 5, 2003. , On November 27, 2010 during the Cavaliers- Memphis Grizzlies game, a new mascot debuted named Sir C.C., who is a swashbuckler character (a la The Three Musketeers ) and teams up with Moondog to provide gametime entertainment at home games.  The Golden State Warriors are an American professional basketball team based in Oakland, California . They are a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The team was established in 1946 as the Philadelphia Warriors based in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania, a founding member of the Basketball Association of America (BAA), and it won the inaugural 1947 BAA Finals that is now considered the first NBA Championship . [ b ] , In 1962 the franchise relocated to the Bay Area and was renamed as the San Francisco Warriors until 1971 when it changed its geographic moniker to Golden State , representing California.  [ c ] Since 1972 the team's home court is Oracle Arena (so renamed in 2006) in Oakland. , The Warriors have won four NBA Championships , a number that ranks fifth in the league. Forty years after the third, they won the 2015 Finals by defeating the Cleveland Cavaliers . , , , The Warriors were founded in 1946 as the Philadelphia Warriors, a charter member of the Basketball Association of America. They were owned by Peter A. Tyrrell , who also owned the Philadelphia Rockets of the American Hockey League .  Tyrell hired Eddie Gottlieb , a longtime basketball promoter in the Philadelphia area, as coach and general manager.  He named the team after an early professional team in the city. , Led by early scoring sensation Joe Fulks , the team won the championship in the league's inaugural 1946–47 season by defeating the Chicago Stags , four games to one. The NBA, which was created by a 1949 merger , officially recognizes that as its own first championship. [ b ] Gottlieb bought the team in 1951. , The Warriors won its other championship in Philadelphia in the 1955–56 season , defeating the Fort Wayne Pistons four games to one. The Warrior stars of this era were future Hall of Famers Paul Arizin , Tom Gola and Neil Johnston . In 1959, the team signed draft pick Wilt Chamberlain . Known as "Wilt the Stilt", he led the team in scoring six times, quickly began shattering NBA scoring records and changed the NBA style of play forever. On March 2, 1962, in a Warrior "home" game played on a neutral court in Hershey, Pennsylvania , Chamberlain scored 100 points against the New York Knicks , a single-game record the NBA ranks among its finest moments.  , In 1962, Franklin Mieuli purchased the majority shares of the team and relocated the franchise to the San Francisco Bay Area, renaming them the San Francisco Warriors. The Warriors played most of their home games at the Cow Palace in Daly City (the facility lies just south of the San Francisco city limits) from 1962–64 and the San Francisco Civic Auditorium from 1964–66, though occasionally playing home games in nearby cities such as Oakland and San Jose . , Prior to the 1963–64 NBA season , the Warriors drafted big man Nate Thurmond to go along with Chamberlain. The Warriors won the Western Division crown that season, but lost the 1964 NBA Finals to the Boston Celtics , four games to one. In the 1964–65 season, the Warriors traded Chamberlain to the Philadelphia 76ers for Connie Dierking , Lee Shaffer , Paul Neumann and $150,000 and won only 17 games. In 1965, they drafted Rick Barry in the first round who went on to become NBA Rookie of the Year that season and then led the Warriors to the NBA finals in the 1966–67 season , losing (four games to two) to Chamberlain's new team that had replaced the Warriors in Philadelphia, the 76ers . , Angered by management's failure to pay him certain incentive bonuses he felt were due him, Barry sat out the 1967–68 season and signed with the Oakland Oaks of the rival American Basketball Association for the following year, but after four seasons in the ABA rejoined the Warriors in 1972. During Barry's absence, the Warriors were no longer title contenders, and the mantle of leadership fell to Thurmond, Jeff Mullins and Rudy LaRusso . They began scheduling more home games in Oakland with the opening of the Oakland Coliseum Arena in 1966 and the 1970–71 season would be the team's last as the San Francisco Warriors. , The franchise adopted its brand name Golden State Warriors prior to the 1971–72 season , in order to suggest that the team represented the entire state of California.  [ c ] Almost all home games were played in Oakland that season; six were played in San Diego, but none in San Francisco or Daly City. Oakland Arena became the team's exclusive home court in 1972. , The Warriors made the playoffs from 1971 to 1977 except in 1974, and won their first NBA championship on the West Coast in 1974–75 . In what many consider the biggest upset in NBA history, Golden State not only defeated the heavily favored Washington Bullets but humiliated them in a four-game sweep. That team was coached by former Warrior Al Attles , and led on the court by Rick Barry, Jamaal Wilkes and Phil Smith . Barry was named MVP of the finals.  , Because of the loss of key players such as Barry, Wilkes and Thurmond to trades and retirements, the Warriors struggled to put a competitive team on the court from 1978 to 1987 after being one of the NBA's dominant teams in the 1960s and most of the 1970s. Through the NBA draft, however, they acquired some players such as high-scoring forward Purvis Short (1978), former Purdue center Joe Barry Carroll (1980) and center Robert Parish (1976), who was traded to the Boston Celtics in 1980 along with the draft pick that would become Kevin McHale for the pick used to draft Carroll. In 1983, the Warriors matched the New York Knicks' offer for free-agent Bernard King , but, unable to pay his high salary, quickly traded him to the Knicks for guard Michael Ray Richardson , whom they soon shipped to New Jersey in exchange for former Georgetown Hoya point guard Eric "Sleepy" Floyd , and journeyman forward Mickey Johnson . (Floyd once scored 29 points for the Warriors in the fourth quarter of a playoff game against the Lakers, though he was later traded to the Houston Rockets). , The departure of these players for various reasons symbolized the franchise's futility during this period, as head coach Attles moved up to the front office as general manager in 1980 and the team made several coaching changes. New owners Jim Fitzgerald and Dan Finane finally managed to return the team to respectability by hiring former Cleveland Cavaliers head coach George Karl as head coach in 1986 after selecting St. John's small forward Chris Mullin in the 1985 NBA draft. , After a subpar stretch in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the team had a brief resurgence under coach Karl, culminating in a 1987 Western Conference Semifinal match against Magic Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers which is still shown on TV in the NBA's Greatest Games series. In the game, Warriors' All-Star point guard Sleepy Floyd 's performance in the second half still stands as the NBA playoff record for points scored in a quarter (29) and in a half (39). His six consecutive field goals in the fourth quarter led to a 51-point finish for him and a victory for the Warriors. , The "Sleepy Floyd game" was a catalyst for increased interest in the NBA in the Bay Area which was furthered by new coach Don Nelson , who engineered another successful string of wins in the late 1980s and early 1990s with the high-scoring trio of point guard Tim Hardaway , guard Mitch Richmond and forward Chris Mullin (collectively known as " Run TMC " after the rap group Run-D.M.C. ). But "Run TMC" stayed together for only two seasons (winning only one playoff series), when coach Nelson, in a move to get a promising young front-court player to complement his run-and-gun system , sent Richmond to the Sacramento Kings for rookie power forward Billy Owens . Nelson had been brought to the Warriors from the Milwaukee Bucks by Jim Fitzgerald , who along with Dan Finnane owned the team between 1986 and 1995 . In 1993–94 , with first-round draft pick and Rookie of the Year power forward Chris Webber playing alongside off-guard Latrell Sprewell , the Warriors made the playoffs. , At the start of the next season, however, a rift formed between Webber and Sprewell on the one hand and Nelson on the other. All three soon left the team, and the organization went into a tailspin. 1994–95 was the first season under new team owner Chris Cohan , who had bought out Fitzgerald and Finnane. The Warriors selected power forward prospect Joe Smith as their first overall draft pick in 1995 and hired Rick Adelman as the new head coach. They sent Tim Hardaway and Chris Gatling to the Miami Heat for Kevin Willis and Bimbo Coles midway through the 1995–96 season, and ended up with a 36–46 record, three wins short of making the playoffs. While their home court, the Oakland Coliseum Arena, was being extensively renovated, the 1996–97 Warriors played their home games in the San Jose Arena and struggled to a 30–52 finish.  , Longtime Seton Hall college coach P. J. Carlesimo , who had been recently fired by the Portland Trail Blazers , replaced Adelman as head coach for 1997–98. Sprewell was suspended for the remainder of the 1997–98 season for losing his temper and choking Carlesimo during a team practice in December, generating the glaring newspaper headline "WARRIORS HIT ROCK BOTTOM" and the declaration by GM Garry St. Jean that Sprewell would never play for the Warriors again. He would not play in the NBA again until he was dealt in January 1999 to the New York Knicks for John Starks , Chris Mills and Terry Cummings . , St. Jean had become the new Warriors' GM in July 1997; he and his predecessor Dave Twardzik received much of the blame for the Warriors' struggles early in Cohan's turbulent tenure as owner in addition to Cohan himself.  St. Jean brought in players such as Terry Cummings, John Starks and Mookie Blaylock who were well past their primes. Twardzik drafted several flops, such as Todd Fuller (while Kobe Bryant was still available as well as Steve Nash and Jermaine O'Neal ) and Steve Logan (who never played an NBA game). In the following draft, the team selected Adonal Foyle while Tracy McGrady was still available. St. Jean did, however, draft future two-time NBA slam dunk champion off-guard Jason Richardson (from Michigan State ), a Warriors' star scorer through the 2006–07 season. , For a few years, with rising stars Richardson, small forward Antawn Jamison and point guard Gilbert Arenas leading the team, the Warriors seemed like a team on the rise; but the young Warriors did not have enough in the competitive Western Conference to make the playoffs. After the 2002–03 season , St. Jean's earlier mistakes of committing money to players like Danny Fortson , Adonal Foyle and Erick Dampier were painfully felt by Warriors' fans when the team was unable to re-sign Arenas despite his desire to stay in the Bay Area. A new rule was implemented in response to second-round draft picks who quickly become superstars. , Chris Mullin succeeded St. Jean with the title of Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations in 2004. He hoped to build a winning team around Jason Richardson, Mike Dunleavy Jr and Troy Murphy , and drafted seven-foot center Andris Biedriņš from Latvia (11th overall). At the 2005 trading deadline, he bolstered to the team with the acquisition of point guard Baron Davis , bringing to the team its first superstar since Mullin himself. The Warriors enjoyed a great start to the 2005–06 season, entering the new year with a plus .500 winning percentage for the first time since 1994, but managed to win only 13 more games through the end of March due to injuries. Davis often found himself at odds with new head coach Mike Montgomery (used to dealing with college players in his long tenure at Stanford) and failed to remain healthy, playing in just 54 games. On April 5, 2006 , the Warriors were officially eliminated from playoff contention in a 114–109 overtime loss to the Hornets , extending their playoff drought to 12 seasons. , Entering the 2006–07 season, the Warriors held the active record (12) for the most consecutive seasons without a playoff appearance (see Active NBA non-playoff appearance streaks ). During the 2006 off-season, Golden State announced that it had bought out the remaining two years of coach Montgomery's contract and hired previous Golden State and former Dallas Mavericks coach Don Nelson to take over for him. During training camp, small forward Matt Barnes established himself in the rotation. On January 17, 2007, the Warriors traded the disappointing Murphy and Dunleavy with promising young power forward Ike Diogu and Keith McLeod to the Indiana Pacers for forward Al Harrington , forward/guard Stephen Jackson , guard Šarūnas Jasikevičius and forward Josh Powell .  This trade allowed the Warriors to "run and gun" their way to the playoffs with a more athletic and talented team. On March 4, 2007, the Warriors suffered a 106–107 loss in Washington, the Wizards handing them their 6th straight loss when former Warrior Arenas hit a technical free throw with less than one second remaining after Nelson had protested a controversial call with the Warriors ahead by a slim margin. The loss dropped them to 26–35, but inspired the team to a point of total determination. , March 4 marked the turning point for the Warriors. The Warriors closed out the regular season (42–40) at 16–5 in their last 21 games.  "We Believe" became the Warriors' slogan for the last two months of the season and the playoffs.  , Led by a healthy Baron Davis, an ever-improving Jason Richardson and young future star off-guard Monta Ellis as well as center Biedriņš, the Warriors immediately dashed the highly favored top-seed Dallas Mavericks' expectations of a short and easy series win with a Game 1 victory in Dallas thanks to Davis' frantic style of play. The Mavericks came back to win Game 2 easily to tie the series at a game apiece, but the Warriors won both Games 3 & 4 with a huge lift from the home crowd at Oracle Arena. A close Game 5 saw the Mavericks eke out a 118–112 victory with a last-minute surge led by superstar forward Dirk Nowitzki to send the series back to California at 3-2. In Game 6, the Warriors engineered a third-quarter 18–0 run to eliminate the Mavericks and become the NBA's first No. 8 seed to beat a No. 1 seed in a seven-game series (and the first NBA No. 8 seed to beat the top seed since 1999 when the New York Knicks eliminated the Miami Heat). It was an upset in name only, given the fact that the Warriors had swept the Mavericks in the regular season series. The Warriors went on to play the Utah Jazz in the second round of the 2006–07 playoffs, where they dropped two close games at EnergySolutions Arena to open the series. The series then shifted to the Oracle Arena, where the Warriors won Game 3 in a convincing blowout. Davis scored 32 points and electrified the crowd with a monster dunk on Jazz forward Andrei Kirilenko late in the fourth quarter, but they lost Game 4 at home, their first loss in Oakland in well over a month and the Jazz closed them out in Game 5 in Salt Lake City . , The Warriors faced early difficulties in their attempt to return to the playoffs. Richardson was traded to the Charlotte Bobcats for rookie Brandan Wright . To make things even worse, Jackson was suspended for seven games over a firearm incident. They opened the 2007-08 season with six straight losses, but Ellis' rise, Davis' solid injury-free season (21.6 points, 8 assists, 4.6 rebounds per game),  and an overall improvement in team chemistry brought them back to playoff contention; but in the end the Warriors were eliminated from the 2008 Western Conference Playoffs despite a 48–34 season, which is the best record in NBA history for a non-playoff team since the NBA playoffs had expanded to eight teams per conference. The Warriors sold out nearly every home game during the season averaging 19,631 per game, the highest in team history. , In the offseason, Baron Davis opted to return to his home town and sign with the Los Angeles Clippers . With the 14th pick of the 2008 NBA draft , the Warriors selected and signed Anthony Randolph out of LSU. To compensate for the loss of Davis, the Warriors signed free agents Corey Maggette and Ronny Turiaf and re-signed Ellis and Andris Biedriņš to long-term contracts. , The Warriors had a disappointing 2008–2009 season, finishing 29–53. Ellis was injured in a moped accident, and suspended for 30 games for riding the vehicle against the terms of his contract, depriving the Warriors of their top player. They traded disenchanted forward Al Harrington to the New York Knicks for guard Jamal Crawford , and were undone by injuries and the minimal experience of their young players such as Anthony Morrow and Brandan Wright. Coach Nelson often had to make adjustments to the starting lineups since many of the original starters missed games due to injuries. Despite the team's losing record, the Warriors were hard to beat when they had a healthy lineup and a strong bench. With leadership and improvement in their young players, they were sometimes able to defeat powerhouse teams such as the Boston Celtics, 99-89. , During the 2009 off-season, Warrior ownership declined to renew the contract of general manager Mullin. Larry Riley , Nelson's longtime assistant coach,  was promoted in his place and drafted Stephen Curry as an outstanding seventh lottery pick, but dubiously traded Jamal Crawford to the Atlanta Hawks for Acie Law and Speedy Claxton . , The Warriors had another injury-prone year in 2009-10.  as they were consistently unable to field their ideal starting lineup. In November, a malcontented Stephen Jackson and seldom-used Acie Law were traded to the Charlotte Bobcats for Raja Bell (out for the season with an injury) and Vladimir Radmanovic . Four days later, they signed center Chris Hunter . Starting in January 2010, they issued multiple 10-day contracts, most notably to power forward Anthony Tolliver from the Idaho Stampede . Due to their multiple injuries, they were granted an exception allowing them to sign Reggie Williams from the Sioux Falls Skyforce to a 10-day contract on March 2, making it their fifth D-League call-up that season, tying an NBA record. They eventually waived the injured Bell to sign Williams for the rest of the year, and finished the season 26–56, fourth in the Pacific Division . , On June 24, the Warriors selected Ekpe Udoh , a power forward from Baylor, as the 6th pick of the 2010 NBA draft. They also introduced a modernized version of their "The City" logo depicting the new eastern span of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge , and switched to a simplified color scheme of royal blue and gold. They also introduced new uniforms reminiscent of the 1969-71 "The City" uniforms. The Warriors made an offseason trade that sent Turiaf, Randolph and Kelenna Azubuike to the New York Knicks in return for star high-scoring power forward David Lee via a sign-and-trade. Lee agreed to a six-year, $80 million deal, on a framework contingent on the decision of superstar forward LeBron James to leave the Cleveland Cavaliers to sign with the Miami Heat that same day. Following Morrow's departure after he signed the New Jersey Nets ' offer sheet, the Warriors signed Dorell Wright , formerly with the Miami Heat, to a three-year, $11 million deal. , On July 15, owner Chris Cohan sold the Warriors to Peter Guber of Mandalay Entertainment and his partner Joe Lacob for a then-record $450 million.  On November 15, the Warriors announced the new 19-person ownership group composed of Joe Lacob , Peter Guber , Vivek Ranadivé , Erika Glazer, Fred Harman , Bob Piccinini, Larry Bowman, Danny German, Marty Glick, Chad Hurley , Craig R. Johnson, Bruce Karsh , Jeffrey A. Miller, Paul Schaeffer, David Scially, Nick Swinmurn , Harry Tsao, John Walecka and Dennis Wong.  , The Warriors continued their signing spree by adding Harvard guard Jeremy Lin to their roster with a one-year partially guaranteed contract containing a second-year team option, the first Chinese-American player in NBA history. Louis Amundson was then added for little under $5 million in mid-September. Keith Smart was hired as head coach that same month after Nelson had resigned before the start of training camp. , In February 2011, the Warriors traded Brandan Wright and Dan Gadzuric for Troy Murphy and a 2011 second-round pick. On February 27, Murphy and the Warriors reached a buyout agreement and he was waived.   , During a steady season without making any real ground in the playoff race, the Warriors broke franchise records with 21 made 3's in a win against the Orlando Magic . In April 2011, Dorell Wright made a franchise record of 184 3's in a season in a home win versus Los Angeles Lakers, surpassing Richardson's 183 in 2005–06. He then broke another NBA record, as the first player to have scored more points in his seventh season than in all his first six seasons combined in a win against the Portland Trail Blazers . He ended the season with the most three-pointers made in the NBA that season with 194, as well as the most 3s attempted with 516, both of which set new Warrior franchise records. , The Warriors failed to make the playoffs after a 36-win season in 2010–11, and coach Smart was dismissed on April 27 due to the change in ownership.  17-year NBA veteran and former ABC and ESPN commentator Mark Jackson replaced him as head coach on June 6.  On December 19, they traded Amundson to the Indiana Pacers for small forward Brandon Rush . , The Warriors did not improve in the 2011–12 NBA season under coach Jackson, finishing the lockout-shorted season with a 23–43 record, 13th in the conference. The team suffered several injuries to key players, and due to the lockout, Jackson could not establish his system in training camp. They then entered into another chaotic rebuilding phase. , Team leader Monta Ellis was traded in mid-March 2012, along with Kwame Brown and Ekpe Udoh , to the Milwaukee Bucks for center Andrew Bogut (out injured for the season) and former Warrior small forward Stephen Jackson, who without playing a game for the Warriors was quickly traded to the San Antonio Spurs for Richard Jefferson and a conditional first-round pick on March 15. These moves saw the rise of Stephen Curry and David Lee to team co-captains, and saw off-guard Klay Thompson , the 11th overall pick of the 2011 NBA draft, move into a starting role. On July 11, they acquired point guard Jarrett Jack from the New Orleans Hornets in a three-team trade also including the Philadelphia 76ers , who received Dorell Wright from Golden State. On August 1, they signed forward Carl Landry on the termination of his one-year contract with the Hornets. In the 2012 NBA draft , they selected small forward Harrison Barnes with the 7th overall pick, center Festus Ezeli with the 30th pick, small forward Draymond Green 35th overall, and 7-foot 1-inch center Ognjen Kuzmic 52nd overall. In early November, swingman Rush was lost for the year with a torn ACL after falling awkwardly on the court early in the second game of the season, and less than a month later the team announced that Bogut was out indefinitely with a foot injury that was more serious than originally reported. Bogut did not return to regular play until late in the season. , Coming out of this maelstrom of trades and injuries with a team starting two rookies (Barnes and Ezeli), the Warriors had one of their best starts in decades, earning their 20th win before hitting the 30-game mark for the first time since 1992. The Warriors also achieved a milestone by completing their first ever 6–1 road trip in franchise history, including a 97–95 win over the defending champion Heat in Miami. On April 9, 2013, with a win over the Minnesota Timberwolves , the Warriors clinched the playoffs for the second time in 19 years and the first time since the 2006–2007 "we believe" Warriors. With the season coming to an end, locals revived the "we believe" saying, originally used as the 2006–2007 Golden State Warriors playoff theme, but re-dubbed it "we belong". , The team finished the season with a record of 47–35, earning the sixth seed in the Western Conference, and defeated the Denver Nuggets in the first round of the playoffs by winning four out of six games. They lost in the second round to the San Antonio Spurs , four games to two. This was the first playoff experience for all of the starters of this group except for Andrew Bogut.  , Other highlights of the season included Stephen Curry's 272 three-point baskets to set an NBA single-season record, giving him the nickname "baby-faced assassin", and the naming of forward David Lee to the 2013 NBA All-Star Game as a reserve, ending the team's 16-year drought without an All Star selection, dating back to Latrell Sprewell in the 1997 season. Curry and Klay Thompson, dubbed the " Splash Brothers "  by team employee Brian Witt  for their backcourt shooting prowess, combined for 483 three-pointers during the season, easily besting the prior record of 435 set by the Orlando Magic's Nick Anderson and Dennis Scott in 1995–96. , With their lone selection in the 2013 NBA draft , the Warriors made 22-year-old Serbian combo-guard Nemanja Nedovic the 30th and final pick of the first round.  In early July 2013, Golden State signed former Denver Nuggets swingman and free agent Andre Iguodala to a four-year, $48 million deal. To make room under their salary cap, the Warriors traded Richard Jefferson , Andris Biedrins and Brandon Rush , along with multiple draft picks, including their 2014 and 2017 first-round picks, to the Utah Jazz.  The Warriors lost free-agent guard Jarrett Jack , who departed for the Cleveland Cavaliers, and free agent power forward Carl Landry , who went to the Sacramento Kings. To help fill the void left by Landry, the Warriors signed forward-center Marreese Speights to a three-year, $10 million contract.  The team also signed one-year deals with veteran center Jermaine O'Neal ($2 million) and point guard Toney Douglas ($1.6 million).  On August 21, the Warriors signed 7 ft 1 in Serbian center Ognjen Kuzmic , who had been playing in Europe since his selection in the 2012 NBA draft, to a guaranteed two-year deal.    , The Warriors began the 2013–14 season showing flashes of brilliance and also plenty of lapses. In early December their record was 12–9, as compared to 17–4 the year before. One challenging factor was a tough starting schedule that saw them play 14 of their first 22 games on the road, including 10 games against teams holding playoff spots in the standings. A stream of injuries also held the team back, including injuries to Festus Ezeli (off-season surgical repair to repair the right knee, out for the season), Toney Douglas (left tibia stress reaction, out nearly a month from mid-November to December), and Jermaine O'Neal (right wrist injury and surgery, out from mid-November to early February). Stephen Curry and Harrison Barnes were also out for at least four games before the all-star break, each with minor injuries. Most prominently of all, Iguodala suffered a hamstring pull in late November that kept him out for over a month, during which time the Warriors' performance suffered significantly on both the defensive and offensive ends of the court, and the team posted a losing 5–7 record while revealing a lack of depth on their bench. With Iguodala back in the lineup, the Warriors went on a 10-game winning streak, which included six consecutive wins on a single road trip, tying an NBA record. The winning streak was the longest for the franchise since the 1975 championship year, and just one short of the team record of 11 consecutive wins, set in the 1971–72 season. , To strengthen their underperforming bench, the Warriors made a three-team trade on January 15, sending Douglas to the Miami Heat and picking up guards Jordan Crawford and MarShon Brooks from the Boston Celtics  and then, a day before the trade deadline, trading Kent Bazemore and Brooks to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for veteran point guard Steve Blake .  Thanks in part to the improved effectiveness of their backup squad, boosted by the additions of Blake and Crawford and the play of 35-year-old Jermaine O'Neal (who returned sooner than expected from wrist surgery), the Warriors were one of the winningest teams in the NBA after the all-star break. Nonetheless, and despite several victories over top contenders, the team displayed a pattern of losing games to inferior teams even at their home arena. On April 11, in a 112–95 stomping of the Los Angeles Lakers at the Staples Center, the Warriors clinched a playoff berth in consecutive seasons for the first time since 1991 and 1992. However, just one day earlier in a loss against the Portland Trail Blazers , Andrew Bogut suffered a cracked rib that would keep him out of the post-season, a big blow to the sixth-seed Warriors' playoff hopes. , The Warriors ended the season 51–31, winning more than 50 games for only the fourth time in franchise history, finishing 20 games over .500 for the first time in 22 years, and tying the 1991-92 squad for the franchise's all-time mark of 24 wins on the road. Even without Bogut, in the first round of the playoffs the Warriors battled the third-seed Los Angeles Clippers to a seventh and deciding game, which the Warriors lost, bringing their 2013-14 season to an end. It was season of many thrilling moments in which the Warriors' played in 17 regular-season games decided by 2 points or less, 6 games with winning shots in the final 3 seconds, and 7 comeback wins in which the Warriors had been behind by 15 points or more.  , In other noteworthy occurrences for the season, Curry was named to the starting lineup for the 2014 NBA All-Star Game . For Curry, the only Warrior named to the team, this was his first all-star appearance in five seasons as an NBA player. Curry hit another notable milestone in posting 4 triple-doubles for the season, tying a franchise record unequaled since Wilt Chamberlain in 1963-64. Curry also averaged career-bests in points and assists; averaging 24.0 points and 8.5 assists in the season. Curry and Klay Thompson continued to set league records in three-point shooting. On February 7, in a 102–87 win over the Chicago Bulls , the backcourt duo became the first teammates to each make a three-pointer in 30 consecutive games.  Curry, who finished the season with 261 threes, set an individual record for most three-pointers in a span of two seasons with 533, surpassing the previous mark of 478 set by Seattle Supersonic Ray Allen in 2004-05 and 2005–06. Together, Thompson and Curry combined for 484 threes on the year, besting by one the NBA record they had set the year before. , Even as the team rolled towards the post-season, signs emerged of trouble in the Warriors' front office. On March 25, the team reassigned assistant coach Brian Scalabrine to the team's NBA Development League Affiliate in Santa Cruz because of what head coach Mark Jackson called a "difference in philosophies"  and what unnamed league sources cited by Yahoo Sports called "an increasingly dysfunctional atmosphere" on the Warriors' coaching staff.  Fewer than two weeks later, assistant coach Darren Erman was fired for secretly recording conversations between coaches, staff and players.  During the post season, rumors persisted in the press that Mark Jackson's job as head coach was in jeopardy, leading the players to make a unanimous declaration of support for Jackson's return only minutes after the Warriors' first-round, game seven playoff loss to the Clippers.  Nonetheless, three days later, on May 6, the team announced the firing of Mark Jackson as head coach.  In his three-season tenure as head coach, Jackson compiled a 121-109 (.526) record, overseeing a terrific turnaround. When Jackson took the helm in 2011, the franchise had made the playoffs only one time over the prior 17 seasons, averaging 30.2 wins per season during that period.  Jackson, 49, became just the third head coach in franchise history to lead a team to at least 50 wins in a season, joining Don Nelson and Alvin Attles, who both hit the mark twice with the Warriors. With 121 wins overall, Jackson ranks fourth on the franchise’s all-time wins list, trailing Attles (557), Nelson (422) and Eddie Gottlieb (263).  On May 14, 2014, the Golden State Warriors named Steve Kerr the team's head coach in a reported $25 million deal over five years.  It is a first-time head-coaching position for Kerr, 48, a five-time NBA champion point guard who holds the all-time career record for accuracy in three-point shooting (.454). Kerr formerly served as president and general manager for the Phoenix Suns basketball team (2007 to 2010), and had most recently been working as an NBA broadcast analyst for Turner Network Television (TNT). , In the 2014-15 season, the Warriors finished with an NBA-best record of 67-15, the most wins in franchise history.  The Warriors also finished with a home record of 39-2, the second best in NBA history. They were first in defensive efficiency for the season and second in offensive efficiency, barely missing the mark that the Julius Erving led Sixers achieved by being first in both offensive and defensive efficiency. On May 4, Stephen Curry was named the 2014-15 NBA Most Valuable Player , the first Warrior since Wilt Chamberlain to do so. In the first round of the playoffs, they swept the New Orleans Pelicans in the first round, then defeated Memphis Grizzlies in the second round and defeated Houston Rockets in the Western Conference Finals. The Warriors advanced to their first NBA Finals since 1975, where they defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in six games to win the NBA Championship and end their 40-year championship drought. Andre Iguodala was named Finals MVP.  , Other highlights of the season included Steph Curry breaking his own record for three-pointers made in a single season with 286. He and Klay Thompson made a combined 525 three-pointers, the most by a duo in NBA History. In the postseason, Steph Curry shattered Reggie Miller's record of 58 made three-pointers in a single postseason with 98. On January 23, 2015, Klay Thompson broke and NBA record for points in a quarter with 37 in the third. Curry was also the leading vote getter for the 2015 NBA All-Star Game . , In April 2014, the Warriors purchased a 12-acre site in Mission Bay , San Francisco, to hold a new 18,000-seat arena which they plan to have ready for the 2018–19 NBA season,  with construction to begin in early 2016.  The location was selected after an original proposal to construct the arena on Piers 30 and 32, just south of the Bay Bridge, met with vocal opposition due to concerns about traffic, environmental impacts and obstruction of views.  The new location eliminates the need for any voter approval, which would have been required with the original site, even though it had been unanimously approved by the San Francisco Supervisors in November 2012.  A waterfront park is planned across from the projected arena, which will be located at an already-existing Muni T-Third stop. The Central Subway, planned to open in 2018, will provide a direct connection between the new site and the downtown Powell Street Muni/BART station . The Golden State Warriors, along with this move, will consider a name change, possibly returning to their former name of San Francisco Warriors. The name change will get input from fans before it becomes official.  , Bob Fitzgerald has done television play-by-play , and former Warrior guard Jim Barnett has done color commentary for the Warriors for over 15 years, currently on Comcast SportsNet Bay Area , where they telecast more than 70 Warrior games a year.  They also host Roundtable Live , a half-hour pre-game show leading up to the broadcast of select Golden State home games. Fitzgerald is in his 16th season as the Warriors' play-by-play man, while Barnett is in his 27th season as color man. Greg Papa and Garry St. Jean are the third and fourth members of the telecast team, specializing in in-game, halftime and post-game analysis, while Rosalyn Gold-Onwude serves as the sideline reporter. , Tim Roye has done the radio play-by-play for Warrior games since 1995. He is joined in the booth by former Warriors forward Tom Tolbert for home games only. All games are broadcast on KNBR , 680 AM. After each game, Roye, Fitzgerald and Barnett get together for post-game radio analysis and a next-game preview. , The team trains at Oakland Convention Center, Oakland, California. They also train at the Marriott Hotel. ,  , Arizin, Fulks, Gola, Johnston and Phillip played all or most of their tenure with the Warriors in Philadelphia. Rodgers' tenure was evenly divided between Philadelphia and San Francisco, and Chamberlain's nearly so. King (Knicks), Lucas (Knicks), Parish (Celtics), Richmond ( Kings ), Sampson ( University of Virginia and Rockets ), and Wilkes (Lakers) were elected mostly for their performances with other teams. Marčiulionis played most of his NBA career with Golden State, but his induction is also for his distinguished international career ( Statyba , USSR , and Lithuania ). Of those elected to the hall primarily as Warriors, only Thurmond, Barry and Mullin spent significant time with the team since the 1971 move to Oakland and the name change to "Golden State". , Most Valuable Player , NBA Finals MVP , NBA All-Star Game MVP , NBA All-Star selections , NBA Scoring Champion , NBA Rookie of the Year , NBA Most Improved Player of the Year , NBA Executive of the Year , NBA Coach of the Year , Slam Dunk Contest , 3 Point Contest , All-NBA First Team , All-NBA Second Team , All-NBA Third Team , NBA All-Star Game head coach , NBA All-Defensive First Team , NBA All-Defensive Second Team , NBA All-Rookie First Team , NBA All-Rookie Second  The Seattle SuperSonics (commonly known as the Sonics ) were a professional basketball team based in Seattle , Washington , that played in the Pacific and Northwest Divisions of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1967 until 2008. After the 2007–08 season ended, the team relocated to Oklahoma City , Oklahoma , and now plays as the Oklahoma City Thunder . , Sam Schulman owned the team from its 1967 inception until 1983. It was also owned by Barry Ackerley (1983–2001), and the Basketball Club of Seattle, headed by Starbucks chairman, president and CEO Howard Schultz (2001–2006). On July 18, 2006, the Basketball Club of Seattle sold the SuperSonics and its Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) sister franchise Seattle Storm to the Professional Basketball Club LLC , headed by Oklahoma City businessman Clay Bennett .  The sale was approved by the NBA Board of Governors on October 24, 2006, and finalized on October 31, 2006, at which point the new ownership group took control.  After failing to find public funding to construct a new arena in the Seattle area, the SuperSonics moved to Oklahoma City before the 2008–09 season , following a $45 million settlement with the city of Seattle to pay off the team's existing lease at KeyArena at Seattle Center in advance of its 2010 expiration.  , Home games were played at KeyArena, originally known as Seattle Center Coliseum, for 33 of the franchise's 41 seasons in Seattle.  In 1978, the team moved to the Kingdome , which was shared with the Seattle Mariners of Major League Baseball (MLB) and the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League (NFL). They returned to the Coliseum full-time in 1985, moving temporarily to the Tacoma Dome in Tacoma, Washington , for the 1994–95 season while the Coliseum was renovated and rebranded as KeyArena. , The SuperSonics won the NBA championship in 1979 . Overall, the franchise won three Western Conference titles: 1978 , 1979, and 1996 . The franchise also won six divisional titles, the most recent being in 2005 , with five in the Pacific Division and one in the Northwest Division. Settlement terms of a lawsuit between the city of Seattle and Clay Bennett's ownership group stipulated the SuperSonics' banners, trophies, and retired jerseys remain in Seattle; the nickname, logo, and color scheme are available to any subsequent NBA team. The SuperSonics' franchise history, however, would be shared with the Thunder.  , , , On December 20, 1966, Los Angeles businessmen Sam Schulman and Eugene V. Klein and a group of minority partners were awarded the NBA franchise for the city of Seattle. Schulman would serve as the active partner and head of team operations. He named the SuperSonics after Boeing 's recently awarded contract for the SST project , which was later canceled. The SuperSonics were Seattle's first major league sports franchise. , Beginning play in October 1967, the SuperSonics were coached by Al Bianchi and featured All-Star guard Walt Hazzard and NBA All-Rookie Team members Bob Rule and Al Tucker . The expansion team stumbled out of the gates with a 144–116 loss in their first game, and finished the season with a 23–59 record.  , Hazzard was traded to the Atlanta Hawks before the start of the next season for Lenny Wilkens . Wilkens brought a strong all-around game to the SuperSonics, averaging 22.4 points per game, 8.2 assists per game, and 6.2 rebounds per game for Seattle in the 1968–69 season . Rule, meanwhile, improved on his rookie statistics with 24.0 points per game and 11.5 rebounds per game. The SuperSonics, however, only won 30 games and Bianchi was replaced by Wilkens as player/coach during the offseason. , Wilkens and Rule both represented Seattle in the 1970 NBA All-Star Game , and Wilkens led the NBA in assists during the 1969–70 season . In June 1970 the NBA owners voted 13–4 to work toward a merger with the ABA ;   SuperSonics owner Sam Schulman, a member of the ABA-NBA merger committee in 1970, was so ardently eager to merge the leagues that he publicly announced that if the NBA did not accept the merger agreement worked out with the ABA, he would move the SuperSonics from the NBA to the ABA. Schulman also threatened to move his soon-to-be ABA team to Los Angeles to compete directly with the Lakers.  The Oscar Robertson suit delayed the merger, and the SuperSonics remained in Seattle. Early in the 1970–71 season , however, Rule tore his Achilles' tendon and was lost for the rest of the year. , Wilkens was named the 1971 All-Star Game MVP , but the big news of the season came when owner Sam Schulman managed to land American Basketball Association Rookie of the Year and MVP Spencer Haywood following a lengthy court battle (see Haywood v. National Basketball Assn. ). The following season, the SuperSonics went on to record their first winning season at 47–35. The team, led by player-coach Wilkens and First Team forward Haywood, held a 46–27 mark on March 3, but late season injuries to starters Haywood, Dick Snyder , and Don Smith contributed to the team losing eight of its final nine games; otherwise, the 1971–72 team might very well have become the franchise's first playoff team. , For the 1972-73 season, Wilkens was dealt to Cleveland in a highly unpopular trade,  and without his leadership the SuperSonics fell to a 26–56 record. One of the few bright spots of the season was Haywood's second consecutive All-NBA First Team selection, as he averaged a SuperSonics record 29.2 points per game and collected 12.9 rebounds per game. , The legendary Bill Russell was hired as the head coach in the following year, and in 1975 he coached the SuperSonics to the playoffs for the first time. The team, which starred Haywood, guards Fred Brown and Slick Watts , and rookie center Tommy Burleson , defeated the Detroit Pistons in a three game mini-series before falling to the eventual champion Golden State Warriors in six games. The next season, the SuperSonics traded Haywood to New York forcing the remaining players to pick up the offensive slack. Guard Fred Brown , now in his fifth season, was selected to the 1976 NBA All-Star Game and finished fifth in the league in scoring average and free throw percentage. Burleson's game continued to strengthen, while Watts led the NBA in both assists and steals and was named to the All-NBA Defensive First Team . The SuperSonics again made the playoffs , but lost to the Phoenix Suns in six games in spite of strong performances from both Brown (28.5 ppg) and Burleson (20.8 ppg) during the series. , Russell left the SuperSonics after the 1976–77 season , and under new coach Bob Hopkins the team started the season dismally at 5–17. Lenny Wilkens was brought back to replace Hopkins, and the team's fortunes immediately turned around. The SuperSonics won 11 of their first 12 games under Wilkens, finished the season at 47–35, won the Western Conference title, and led the Washington Bullets three games to two before losing in seven games in the 1978 NBA Finals . Other than the loss of center Marvin Webster to New York, the SuperSonics roster stayed largely intact during the off-season, and in the 1978–79 season they went on to win their first division title. In the playoffs , the Supersonics defeated the Phoenix Suns in a tough seven game conference final series to set up a rematch with the Washington Bullets in the finals. This time, the Bullets lost to the SuperSonics in five games to give Seattle its first, and only, NBA title. The championship team roster included the powerful backcourt tandem of Gus Williams and Finals MVP Dennis Johnson , second year All-Star center Jack Sikma , forwards John Johnson and Lonnie Shelton , and key reserves Fred Brown and Paul Silas . , The 1979–80 season saw the SuperSonics finish second in the Pacific Division to the Los Angeles Lakers with a strong 56–26 record. Fred Brown won the NBA's first three-point shooting percentage title, Jack Sikma played in the second of his seven career All-Star Games for Seattle, Gus Williams and Dennis Johnson were both named to the All-NBA Second Team, and Johnson was also named to the All-NBA First Defensive Team for the second consecutive year. The SuperSonics made it to the Western Conference Finals for the third straight season, but lost to the Lakers in five games. It was the last time that the backcourt of Williams and Johnson would play together in SuperSonics uniforms, as Johnson was traded to the Phoenix Suns before the start of the 1980–81 season and Williams sat out the year due to a contract dispute. As a result, the SuperSonics fell to last place in the Pacific Division with a 34–48 mark, so far the only time they have ever finished in last place. Williams returned for the 1981–82 season , and Seattle managed respectable 52–30 and 48–34 records during the next two years. , In 1981, the Sonics also created the Sonics SuperChannel , the first sports subscription cable service.  , In October 1983, original team owner Sam Schulman sold the SuperSonics to Barry Ackerley , initiating a period of decline and mediocrity for the franchise. 1984 saw Fred Brown retire after playing 13 productive seasons, all with Seattle. His career reflected much of the SuperSonics' history to that time, having been on the same team roster as Rule and Wilkens during his rookie season, playing a key role on Seattle's first playoff teams, and being the team's important sixth man during the championship series years. In recognition of his many contributions to the team, Brown's number was retired in 1986. Lenny Wilkens left the organization following the 1984–85 season , and when Jack Sikma was traded after the 1985–86 season, the last remaining tie to the SuperSonics' championship team (aside from trainer Frank Furtado) had been severed. , Among the few SuperSonics highlights of second half of the 1980s were Tom Chambers ' All-Star Game MVP award in 1987, Seattle's surprise appearance in the 1987 Western Conference Finals, and the performance of the power trio of Chambers, Xavier McDaniel , and Dale Ellis . In 1987–88, the three players each averaged over 20 points per game with Ellis at 25.8 ppg, McDaniel at 21.4, and Chambers at 20.4. In the 1988–89 season , with Chambers having signed with Phoenix, Ellis improved his scoring average to 27.5 points per game and finished second in the league in three-point percentage. The SuperSonics finished with a 47–35 record, and made it to the second round of the 1989 playoffs . , The SuperSonics began setting a new foundation with the drafting of forward Shawn Kemp in 1989 and guard Gary Payton in 1990, and the trading of Dale Ellis and Xavier McDaniel to other teams during the 1990–91 season . It was George Karl 's arrival as head coach in 1992, however, that marked a return to regular season and playoff competitiveness for the SuperSonics. With the continued improvement of Gary Payton and Shawn Kemp, the SuperSonics posted a 55–27 record in the 1992–93 season and took the Phoenix Suns to seven games in the Western Conference Finals. , The next year, 1993–94 , the SuperSonics had the best record in the NBA at 63–19, but suffered a first round loss to the Denver Nuggets , becoming the first #1 seed to lose a playoff series to an 8th seed. The Sonics moved to the Tacoma Dome for the 1994–95 season while the Coliseum underwent renovations and went on to earn a second place 57-25 record. Again, the Sonics were eliminated in the first round, this time to the Los Angeles Lakers in four games. The team returned to the rebuilt Coliseum, renamed KeyArena for the 1995–96 season . , Perhaps the strongest roster the Supersonics ever had was the 1995–96 team, which had a franchise best 64–18 record. With a deep roster of All-NBA Second Team selections Kemp and Payton, forward Detlef Schrempf , center Sam Perkins , guard Hersey Hawkins , and guard Nate McMillan , the team reached the NBA Finals , but lost to the Michael Jordan-led Chicago Bulls in six games. Seattle continued to be a Western Conference powerhouse during the next two seasons, winning 57 games in 1996–97 and 61 games in 1997–98 for their second and third straight Pacific Division titles. At the end of the 1997–98 season long-time Sonic and defensive specialist Nate McMillan retired, and disagreements with management led Karl to end his tenure as head coach. He was replaced by former Sonic Paul Westphal for the 1998–99 season. , The 1998–99 season saw the SuperSonics again descend into an extended period of mediocrity. Westphal was fired during the 2000–01 season and replaced by then-assistant coach Nate McMillan on an interim basis, eventually losing the "interim" label the next year. The 2002–03 season saw All-Star Gary Payton traded to the Milwaukee Bucks , and it also marked the end to the SuperSonics 11-year streak of having a season with a winning percentage of at least .500, the second longest current streak in the NBA at the time. , The 2004–05 team surprised many when it won the organization's sixth division title under the leadership of Ray Allen and Rashard Lewis , winning 52 games and defeating the Sacramento Kings in the first round of the 2005 NBA Playoffs and advancing to the 2005 Western Conference Semifinals where the Sonics would proceed to lose in 6 games to the established trio of Tony Parker , Tim Duncan , and Manu Ginobili and the San Antonio Spurs , who would later go on to defeat the Detroit Pistons in the 2005 NBA Finals . This appearance also marked the last time that this incarnation of the SuperSonics would make the playoffs. During the off-season in 2005, head coach Nate McMillan left the Sonics to accept a high-paying position to coach the Portland Trail Blazers . After his departure, the team regressed the following season with a 35–47 record. , On May 22, 2007, the SuperSonics were awarded the 2nd pick in the 2007 NBA Draft , equaling the highest draft position the team has ever held. They selected Kevin Durant from the University of Texas . On June 28, 2007, the SuperSonics traded Ray Allen and the 35th pick of the 2nd round ( Glen Davis ) in the 2007 NBA Draft to the Boston Celtics for rights to the 5th pick Jeff Green , Wally Szczerbiak , and Delonte West . On July 11, 2007, the SuperSonics and the Orlando Magic agreed to a sign and trade for Rashard Lewis . The SuperSonics received a future second-round draft pick and a $9.5 million trade exception from the Magic. On July 20 the SuperSonics used the trade exception and a second-round draft pick to acquire Kurt Thomas and two first-round draft picks from the Phoenix Suns .  , In 2008, morale was low at the beginning of the SuperSonics season as talks with the City of Seattle for a new arena had broken down. The Sonics had gotten a franchise player with second overall pick in the NBA draft with Kevin Durant. However, with the Ray Allen trade the Sonics did not have much talent to surround their rookie forward, as they lost their first eight games under Coach P.J. Carlesimo on the way to a 3-14 record in the first month of the season. Durant would live up to expectations, as he led all rookies in scoring at 20.3 ppg and won the Rookie of the Year. However, the Seattle SuperSonics posted a franchise worst record of 20-62. It would end up being the final season in Seattle as Clay Bennett ended up getting the rights to move the team after settling all the legal issues with the city.  , From 2001 to 2006, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz was the owner of the Seattle SuperSonics. On July 18, 2006, Schultz sold the SuperSonics and its sister team, the WNBA 's Seattle Storm , to the Professional Basketball Club LLC (PBC), a group of businessmen from Oklahoma City for $350 million. The team moved to Oklahoma City in 2008 and now plays as the Oklahoma City Thunder. During the time that the team was based in Seattle, Howard Schultz had 58 partners or minor owners, (Basketball Club of Seattle, L.L.P.) , In 2006, after unsuccessful efforts to persuade Washington state government officials to provide funding to update KeyArena , the SuperSonics' ownership group, led by Howard Schultz, sold the team to the Professional Basketball Club LLC (PBC), an investment group headed by Oklahoma City businessman Clayton Bennett . The purchase, at $ 350 million, also included the Seattle Storm WNBA franchise. Schultz sold the franchise to Bennett's group because they thought that Bennett would not move the franchise to Oklahoma City but instead keep it in Seattle. Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett was quoted as saying, "I think it's presumptuous to assume that Clay Bennett and his ownership group won't own that Seattle team for a long, long time in Seattle or somewhere else. It's presumptuous to assume they're going to move that franchise to Oklahoma City," Cornett said. "I understand that people are going to say that seems to be a likely scenario, but that's just speculation."  , After failing to persuade local governments to fund a $ 500 million arena complex in the Seattle suburb of Renton , Bennett's group notified the NBA that it intended to move the team to Oklahoma City  and requested arbitration with the City of Seattle to be released from the Sonics' lease with KeyArena.  When the request was rejected by a judge, Seattle sued Bennett's group to enforce the lease that required the team to play in KeyArena through 2010.  , On July 2, 2008, a settlement was reached that allowed the team to move under certain conditions, including the ownership group's payment of $45 million to Seattle and the possibility of an additional $30 million by 2013 if a new team had not been given to the city. It was agreed that the SuperSonics' name would not be used by Oklahoma City and that team's history could be shared between Oklahoma City and any future NBA team in Seattle.  The team began play as the Oklahoma City Thunder for the 2008–09 NBA season after becoming the third NBA franchise to relocate in the past decade. The two previous teams to relocate were the Vancouver Grizzlies , which moved to Memphis, Tennessee and began play as the Memphis Grizzlies for the 2001–02 NBA season ; and the Charlotte Hornets , which moved to New Orleans , Louisiana and began play as the New Orleans Hornets for the 2002–03 NBA season . , In months prior to the settlement, Seattle publicly released email conversations that took place within Bennett's ownership group and alleged that they indicated at least some members of the group had a desire to move the team to Oklahoma City prior to the purchase in 2006. Before that, Sonics co-owner Aubrey McClendon told The Journal Record , an Oklahoma City newspaper, that "we didn't buy the team to keep it in Seattle; we hoped to come here," although Bennett denied knowledge of this.  Seattle used these incidents to argue that the ownership failed to negotiate in good faith, prompting Schultz to file a lawsuit seeking to rescind the sale of the team and transfer the ownership to a court-appointed receiver.  The NBA claimed Schultz' lawsuit was void because Schultz signed a release forbidding himself to sue Bennett's group, but also argued that the proposal would have violated league ownership rules. Schultz dropped the case before the start of the 2008–09 NBA season.  , In 2009, Seattle-area filmmakers called the Seattle SuperSonics Historical Preservation Society produced a critically acclaimed documentary film titled Sonicsgate - Requiem For A Team that details the rise and demise of the Seattle SuperSonics franchise. The movie focuses on the more scandalous aspects of the team's departure from Seattle, and it won the 2010 Webby Award for 'Best Sports Film'.  , In 2011, a group of investors led by Valiant Capital Management hedge fund founder Christopher R. Hansen spoke with then-Seattle mayor Mike McGinn about the possibilities of investing in an arena in hopes of securing an NBA franchise and reviving the SuperSonics.  An offer was made by McGinn to Hansen to obtain ownership of KeyArena for little to no money to aid in his efforts.  As KeyArena was deemed unacceptable by the NBA and barely breaking even in operation, the facility would likely have needed to be leveled and a new one built on the site. Determining there were transportation concerns in the Lower Queen Anne neighborhood around the Seattle Center , Hansen declined in favor of building a new arena at another location. , Hansen began quietly purchasing available land near Safeco Field in Seattle's SoDo industrial neighborhood, at the southern end of what was designated a Stadium Transition Overlay District housing both the baseball stadium and CenturyLink Field football and soccer stadium. A short time later, Hansen presented to McGinn and King County Executive Dow Constantine the proposal for a basketball, hockey, and entertainment arena at the SoDo site. McGinn employed a stadium consultant on the city's behalf to study the viability of such a project. Local media took notice of the land purchases and began to postulate that it was for an arena. Rumors of meetings between McGinn and Hansen's investment group began to circulate in late 2011 and were finally acknowledged in early 2012. , At that time, rumors that Hansen would begin pursuing a vulnerable franchise to relocate to Seattle began making the rounds. Most of the discussion centered on the Sacramento Kings , a struggling franchise that had been trying to put together a plan to replace the aging Sleep Train Arena , then called the Power Balance Arena, for years with no luck. While Hansen had not spoken in public about his desires or pursuits for a specific team, the rumors were rampant enough that Think Big Sacramento, a community action group created by Sacramento mayor Kevin Johnson to develop solutions for the Kings, composed an open letter to Hansen asking him not to pursue the city's team.  Meanwhile, negotiations between McGinn, Constantine, and Hansen continued on development of a memorandum of understanding that would lay out the relationship for a public-private partnership on the new arena. , On May 16, 2012, after coming to agreement, McGinn, Constantine, and Hansen presented the proposed Memorandum of Understanding to the public.  McGinn and Constantine had insisted on a number of protections for the citizens of Seattle and King County, specifically that no public financing on the project would be committed until Hansen and his investors had secured an NBA team to be primary tenant. The MOU proposal included a financial model that made the project "self-financed," in which no new taxes would be levied to provide funds and city bonds issued would be paid back by taxes and revenue generated solely by the new arena. The proposal was turned over to the Seattle City Council and the King County Council for review and approval. , The King County Council voted to approve the MOU on July 30, 2012, adding amendments that provided for work with the Port of Seattle, securing the SuperSonics naming rights, offering reduced price tickets, support for the Seattle Storm WNBA franchise, and require an economic analysis.  The approval was also on the condition that any changes made by the Seattle City Council, which still had yet to vote on the proposal, would need to be voted on and approved separately. The Seattle council had announced that morning that amendments of their own were intended and negotiations began. , Hansen and the Seattle City Council announced on September 11, 2012, a tentative agreement on a revised MOU that included the county council's amendments and new provisions, specifically a personal guarantee from Hansen to cover not only cost overruns of construction of the new arena but to make up any backfall for annual repayment of the city bonds issued.  To address concerns of the Port of Seattle, the Seattle Mariners , and local industry, a SoDo transportation improvement fund to be maintained at $40 million by tax revenue generated by the arena was also included. Also, all parties agreed that transaction documents would not be signed and construction would not begin before the state required environmental impact analysis was completed. By a vote of 7-2, the Seattle City Council approved the amended MOU on September 24, 2012.  The King County Council reviewed the amended MOU and voted unanimously in favor of approval on October 15, 2012.  The final MOU was signed and fully executed by Mayor McGinn and Executive Constantine on October 18, 2012, starting an effective period of the agreement of five years. , In June 2012, it was revealed that Hansen's investment partners included then- Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and brothers Erik and Peter Nordstrom of fashion retailer Nordstrom, Inc. . Peter Nordstrom had been a minority owner of the SuperSonics under Howard Schultz's ownership. Wally Walker , former Sonics executive, was also later revealed to be part of Hansen's group. On January 9, 2013, media reports surfaced regarding the imminent sale of majority ownership of the Sacramento Kings to Hansen, Ballmer, the Nordstroms, and Walker for $500 million to relocate to Seattle as early as the 2013–14 NBA season .    , On January 20, 2013, several sources reported that the Maloof family had reached a binding purchase and sale agreement to sell Hansen and Ballmer's ownership group their 53% majority stake in the Kings franchise, pending approval of the NBA's Board of Governors.  The next day, the NBA, Hansen, and the Maloofs all released statements announcing the agreement, which also included the 12% minority stake of owner Robert Hernreich , and based the sale price on a team valuation of $525 million.    Sacramento mayor Johnson offered a quick rebuttal to the announcement, stating that the agreement was not a done deal and that Sacramento would have the opportunity to present a counteroffer to the NBA. , David Stern , then NBA Commissioner , confirmed on February 6, 2013, that the Maloofs had filed paperwork with the league office to officially request relocation of the Kings from Sacramento to Seattle on behalf of the potential new ownership group.   , Johnson, with guidance from Stern and the NBA league office, began to assemble an alternative ownership group that would keep the Kings in Sacramento and aid in getting a new arena constructed. On February 26, 2013, the Sacramento City Council voted to enter into negotiations with an unnamed group of investors revealed two days later to be headed by grocery magnate and developer Ron Burkle and Mark Mastrov, founder of 24 Hour Fitness . An initial counteroffer presented to the NBA by this new group was deemed "not comparable" as to merit consideration.  Burkle eventually left the group because of a conflict with other business interests, but offered to be primary developer of lands around the planned downtown location of the new arena to aid in city council passage of public funding for the project.  Mastrov took a backseat to Vivek Ranadivé , founder and CEO of TIBCO and a minority owner of the Golden State Warriors , brought in to assemble a stronger group of investors.  Others, including Paul Jacobs , CEO of Qualcomm , Sacramento developer Mark Friedman, former Facebook executive Chris Kelly, and manufacturer Raj Bhathal, were added to the group to address team ownership and arena investment. , Ahead of the annual Board of Governors meeting where they were expected to vote on approval of the sale of the Kings to Hansen and Ballmer's group, as well as the relocation request, members of the NBA owners' finance and relocation committees held a meeting in New York City on April 3, 2013, for the Seattle group and the Sacramento group to each present their proposals.  Any vote would only be on the PSA presented by Hansen and Ballmer, and the Sacramento proposal was considered a "backup offer." Coming out of that meeting, the NBA removed the vote from the agenda of the BOG meeting and postponed it for two weeks while information was reviewed. Despite stated desires to the contrary, a bidding war began between Hansen's and Ranadivé's groups, including Hansen raising the team valuation of their offer twice from $525 million to $550 million to $625 million, and Ranadivé offering to forgo the team revenue sharing that has frequently kept smaller market teams like the Kings financially stable. , With the meeting of the Board of Governors to vote moved again to mid-May, the groups were asked to make another brief presentation to the full relocation committee on April 29, 2013. The committee voted to recommend rejection of the relocation request to the full board.  When the Board of Governors finally convened in Dallas on May 15, 2013, they heard final presentations from both the Seattle and Sacramento groups. The BOG voted 22-8 against moving the Kings from Sacramento to Seattle.  As the PSA for the sale of the team was, for all intents and purposes, dependent upon relocation, the NBA rejected the sale without vote. , Though initially resistant to the idea, after negotiations, on May 17, 2013, the Maloof family and Hernreich formally agreed to sell their ownership stake in the Kings -- (65 percent of the team, valued at $ 535 million) -- to Ranadivé's ownership group.  Part of the $348 million purchase was considered paid with a $30 million non-refundable deposit Chris Hansen had paid to the Maloofs to establish their business relationship, though Hansen has no ownership stake in the team. , In September 2013, then-Deputy Commissioner Adam Silver , in line to become the next commissioner upon David Stern's retirement in February 2014, made the announcement that the Milwaukee Bucks would need to replace the aging BMO Harris Bradley Center because of its small size and lack of amenities.  The team had recently signed a lease through the 2016-17 NBA season, but the NBA made it clear that the lease would not be renewed past that point. With counties surrounding Milwaukee passing ordinances that they would not approve a regional tax option to fund a new arena, rumors began swirling that owner Herb Kohl would need to sell all or part of his ownership of the team. Though Kohl had repeatedly stated he would not sell to someone intent on moving the Bucks out of Wisconsin, many had pegged the team as a likely potential candidate to move to Seattle. , On April 16, 2014, it was announced that Kohl had agreed to sell the franchise to New York hedge-fund investors Marc Lasry and Wesley Edens for a record $550 million. The deal included provisions for contributions of $100 million each from Kohl and the new ownership group, for a total of $200 million towards the construction of a new downtown arena.  During sale discussions, it was revealed that Hansen and Ballmer had expressed interest in purchasing the team for more than $600 million but had not made a formal offer because of Kohl's insistence that the team stay in Milwaukee.  , On January 2, 2015, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Atlanta Spirit , owners of the Atlanta Hawks , would put the team up for sale. Initially, only majority owner Bruce Levenson would put his stake in the team up for sale; however, the remaining minority owners announced that they would sell their stakes as well. On January 6, 2015, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported that Chris Hansen and film producer Thomas Tull would put in separate bids to acquire the Hawks and move them to Seattle. However, the NBA stated that the Hawks will remain in Atlanta as a condition of their sale; additionally, any attempt to move the Hawks would have incurred a $75 million fee from the city of Atlanta and Fulton County for breaking the Hawks' lease at Philips Arena before 2017.   , The Seattle SuperSonics' first uniforms had "Sonics" displayed in a font that was also used by the Cincinnati Royals (now the Sacramento Kings ). The road jerseys were green and had the lettering displayed in yellow coloring, where the home uniforms were white and had the lettering green. In 1995, the SuperSonics changed their uniforms adding red and orange, removing yellow, to their new jerseys that would last six seasons. It displayed the new Sonics logo on the front and their alternate logo on the shorts. The home uniforms had green stripes on the right side of the jersey and shorts, while the green road jersey had red stripes. , The final SuperSonics uniforms were worn from the 2001–02 NBA season through the 2007–08 NBA season . They were commissioned by owner Howard Schultz for design by Seattle design agency Hornall Anderson. The home jerseys were white with green and gold trim, displaying "SONICS" across the chest. Road uniforms were dark green with white and gold accents, with "SEATTLE" across the chest. The alternate uniform was gold with green and white trim, again with "SONICS" arched across the chest. These uniforms were a nod to a similar style worn from the 1975–76 season through the 1994–95 season.  , The SuperSonics were traditional rivals with the Portland Trail Blazers because of the teams' proximity; the rivalry had been dubbed the I-5 Rivalry in reference to Interstate 5 that connects the two cities, which are only 174 miles apart. The rivalry was fairly equal in accomplishments, with both teams winning one championship each. The all-time record of this rivalry is 98–94 in favor of the SuperSonics.    , The SuperSonics were rivals of the Los Angeles Lakers , particularly due to the teams' longstanding pairing in the Pacific Division of the Western Conference . The Lakers' sustained success meant regular season games often impacted NBA Playoffs seedings, with the teams matching up head-to-head for numerous playoff battles.    , Bold denotes still active with team.
